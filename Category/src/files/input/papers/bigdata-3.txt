Mining Big Data: Current Status, and Forecast to the
Future titlerp Big Data is a new term used to identify the datasets that
due to their large size and complexity, we can not manage
them with our current methodologies or data mining software
tools. Big Data mining is the capability of extracting
useful information from these large datasets or streams of
data, that due to its volume, variability, and velocity, it
was not possible before to do it. The Big Data challenge
is becoming one of the most exciting opportunities for the
next years. We present in this issue, a broad overview of
the topic, its current status, controversy, and forecast to
the future. We introduce four articles, written by inuential
scientists in the eld, covering the most interesting and
state-of-the-art topics on Big Data mining.abstractrp keywordsrp Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability
to collect data from various sensors, devices, in dierent
formats, from independent or connected applications. This
data ood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze,
store and understand these datasets. Consider the Internet
data. The web pages indexed by Google were around one
million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and
have already exceeded 1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expansion
is accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of
social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter,
Weibo, etc., that allow users to create contents freely and
amplify the already huge Web volume. Furthermore, with
mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get realtime
data on people from dierent aspects, the vast amount
of data that mobile carrier can potentially process to improve
our daily life has signicantly outpaced our past CDR
(call data record)-based processing for billing purposes only.
It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT) applications
will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented level. People
and devices (from home coee machines to cars, to buses,
railway stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Trillions
of such connected components will generate a huge
data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered
from the data to help improve quality of life and make our
world a better place. For example, after we get up every
morning, in order to optimize our commute time to work
and complete the optimization before we arrive at oce, the
system needs to process information from trac, weather,
construction, police activities to our calendar schedules, and
perform deep optimization under the tight time constraints.
In all these applications, we are facing signicant challenges
in leveraging the vast amount of data, including challenges
in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic design (3) business
models.
As an example of the interest that Big Data is having in
the data mining community, the grand theme of this year's
KDD conference was 'Mining the Big Data'. Also there was
a specic workshop BigMine'12 in that topic: 1st Interna-
tional Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous
Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming Mod-
els and Applications1. Both events successfully brought together
people from both academia and industry to present
their most recent work related to these Big Data issues, and
exchange ideas and thoughts. These events are important
in order to advance this Big Data challenge, which is being
considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the
years to come.
We introduce Big Data mining and its applications in Section
2. We summarize the papers presented in this issue in
Section 3, and discuss about Big Data controversy in Section
4. We point the importance of open-source software
tools in Section 5 and give some challenges and forecast to
the future in Section 6. Finally, we give some conclusions in
Section 7.introductionrpBig Data is going to continue growing during the next years,
and each data scientist will have to manage much more
amount of data every year. This data is going to be more
diverse, larger, and faster. We discussed in this paper some
insights about the topic, and what we consider are the main
concerns, and the main challenges for the future. Big Data is
becoming the new Final Frontier for scientic data research
and for business applications. We are at the beginning of
a new era where Big Data mining will help us to discover
knowledge that no one has discovered before. Everybody is
warmly invited to participate in this intrepid journey.conclusionrp[1] SAMOA, http://samoa-project.net, 2013.

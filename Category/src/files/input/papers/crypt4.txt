A Practical Approach for Secure Internet Banking based
on Cryptography
 titlerp
There are a continuously growing number of customers who use Internet banking because of its convenience. But the
security and privacy of Information may be one of the biggest concerns to the Online Banking users. The problem with Online
banking applications is that they send data directly to customer in plain text form compromising with security. The solutions to the
security issues require the use of software-based solutions that involve the use of encryption algorithms. For this we propose a
challenge/response -based short-time password authentication methods using Symmetric cryptography in combination with Software
Security model. In this approach bank hides customer transaction data is secure SMS using IDEA symmetric cryptographic algorithm
and send it to customer application supported handset. Customer application decrypts data in secure manner the encryption and
decryption are characterized by a secret key that the legal parties have to posses. So, in face of the current security issues and the
growing number of attacks and consequent frauds, new internet banking systems should be designed as to provide better
authentication and identification methods. And these methods can be implemented to the Mobile banking to address the Security
concern.

he security models for online banking systems currently in use are strongly based on Internet banking user identification and
authentication methods[2], which are also the components where most Internet banking systems' vulnerabilities are found. The
existing SMS system does not have any built-in procedure to authenticate [1] the text and offer security for the text transmitted as
data, because most of the applications for mobile devices are designed and developed without taking security into consideration.
1(a) Security
 Security of the transactions is the primary concern of the Internet-based industries. The lack of
Security may result in serious damages the security issue [3] will be further discussed in the next section along with the possible
attacks due to the insufficient protections. The examples of potential hazards of the electronic banking system are tra nsferring funds,
and minting electric currency, etc.
1(b) Authentication
 Encryption may help make the transactions more secure. The Internet of today has become an integral part of our
Everyday life and the proportion of users expecting to be able to manage their bank accounts anywhere anytime is constantly growing
[4]. As such, Internet banking has come to age as a crucial component of any financial institution’s multi-channel strategy. Based on
the assumption that only an authentic user is able to do so, successful authentication eventually enables an authorized user to access
his private information.[5]
1(c) Short-Time Password Solution
 Considering today’s pervasiveness of malicious software and phishing attacks, any Internet banking solution must be resistant
against stealing attacks. For this we propose a challenge/response-based short-time password authentication method using symmetric
cryptography in combination with a Software Security Model [6, 7]. The short-time password solution is in use at in software-based
security systems, the coding and decoding of information is done using specialized security software.
 introductionrp
Internet banking is offering its customers with a wide range of services: Customers are able to interact with their banking accounts
as well as make financial transactions from virtually anywhere without time restrictions. In order for electronic banking to continue to
grow, the security and the privacy aspects need to be improved. With the security and privacy issues resolved, the future of electronic
banking can be very prosperous. The future of electronic banking will be a system where users are able to interact with their banks
?worry-free? and banks are operated under one common standard. The security models for online banking systems currently in use are
strongly based on Internet banking user identification and authentication methods, which are also the components where most Internet
banking systems' vulnerabilities are found.
This paper describes current online banking problems and discusses the need for security testing for online banking. The system
allows user to carry out all banking transaction securely from anywhere, anytime. We have implemented system using symmetric key
IDEA algorithm.
In future better power consumption algorithm like blowfish can be tried out. Steganogrpahy can also be applied for secure Internet
banking and mobile banking transactions. We can use concept of STK, SIM application toolkit where bank can stored the applic ation
and encryption keys on SIM.

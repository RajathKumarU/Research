CLOUD-BASED BIG DATA ANALYTICS – A SURVEY OF CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS titlerpThe advent of the digital age has led to a rise in different types of data with every passing day. In fact, it is expected that half of the total data will be on the cloud by 2016. This data is complex and needs to be stored, processed and analyzed for information that can be used by organizations. Cloud computing provides an apt platform for big data analytics in view of the storage and computing requirements of the latter. This makes cloud-based analytics a viable research field. However, several issues need to be addressed and risks need to be mitigated before practical applications of this synergistic model can be popularly used. This paper explores the existing research, challenges, open issues and future research direction for this field of study.abstractrpCloud-based Big Data Analytics, Big Data, Big Data Analytics, Big Data Cloud ComputingkeywordsrpWith the advent of the digital age, the amount of data being generated, stored and shared has been on the rise. From data warehouses, webpages and blogs to audio/video streams, all of these are sources of massive amounts of data. The result of this proliferation is the generation of massive amounts of pervasive and complex data, which needs to be efficiently created, stored, shared and analyzed to extract useful information.
This data has huge potential, ever-increasing complexity, insecurity and risks, and irrelevance. The benefits and limitations of accessing this data are arguable in view of the fact that this analysis may involve access and analysis of medical records, social media interactions, financial data, government records and genetic sequences. The requirement of an efficient and effective analytics service, applications, programming tools and frameworks has given birth to the concept of Big Data Processing and Analytics.
Big data analytics has found application in several domains and fields. Some of these applications include medical research, solutions for the transportation and logistics sector, global security and prediction and management of issues concerning the socio-economic and environmental sector, to name a few. Apart from standard applications in business and commerce and society administration, scientific research is one of the most critical applications of big data in the real world [30]. According to O’Driscoll, Daugelaite and Sleator [32], one of the main future applications of big data analytics and cloud computing lies in life sciences. Some of the identified high-impact areas include systems biology, structure and protein function prediction, personalized medicine and metagenomics. Besides this, one of the most relevant applications of big data analytics is to improve the existing business models for efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Big data, by definition, is a term used to describe a variety of data - structured, semi-structured and unstructured, which makes it a complex data infrastructure [18]. The complexity of this infrastructure requires powerful management and technological solutions. One of the commonly used models for explaining big data is the multi-V model. Figure 1 illustrates the multi-V model.Some of the Vs used to characterize big data include variety, volume, velocity, veracity and value [4]. The different types of data available on a dataset determine variety while the rate at which data is produced determines velocity. Predictably, the size of data is called volume. The two additional characteristics, veracity and value, indicate data reliability and worth with respect to big data exploitation, respectively.In addition, Wu, Zhu, Wu and Ding [26] gave another characterization called the HACE theorem. According to this theorem, big data has two main characteristics. Firstly, it has a large volume of data that comes from different and heterogeneous sources, which is complex in nature. Secondly, the data is decentralized and distributed in nature.
Data is the central element of communication and collaboration in Internet and all the applications that are built on this platform. The immense popularity of data intensive applications like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Amazon, eBay and Google+ contributes to increasing requirement of storage and processing of data in the cloud environment. Schouten [21] uses Gartner’s estimation to predict that by the year 2016, half of the data will be on the cloud.
Moreover, the data mining algorithms used for Big Data analytics possess high computing requirements. Therefore, they require high performance processors to do the job. The cloud provides a good platform for big data storage, processing and analysis, addressing two of the main requirements of big data analytics, high storage and high performance computing.
The cloud computing environment offers development, installation and implementation of software and data applications ‘as a service’. Three multi-layered infrastructures namely, platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), exist. Infrastructure-as-a-service is a model that provides computing and storage resources as a service. On the other hand, in case of PaaS and SaaS, the cloud services provide software platform or software itself as a service to its clients.
The cost of storage has considerably reduced with the advent of cloud-based solutions. In addition, the ‘pay-as-you-go’ model and the concept of commodity hardware allow effective and timely processing of large data, giving rise to the concept of ‘big data as a service’. An example of one such platform is Google BigQuery, which provides real-time insights from big data in the cloud environment [12]. Shakil, Sethi, and Alam[37] demonstrates the application of cloud for management of Big Data in educational institutions which special focus on University-level data.
However, there have not been many practical applications of big data analytics that make use of the cloud. This has led to an increasing shift of research focus towards cloud-based big data analytics. An issue that is evident in this arrangement is information security and data privacy. As part of the cloud services, trust in data is also defined as a service. There shall be a considerable decrease in trust in view of the fact that the chances of security breaches and privacy violation will significantly rise upon implementation of big data strategies in the cloud. In addition, another important issue of ownership and control will also exist.
However, the potential of cloud-based big data analytics has compelled researchers to look into the existing issues to explore solutions. This paper discusses the different facets and aspects of data mining techniques/strategies adoption in the cloud environment for big data analytics. Moreover, it also looks into the existing research, identified challenges and future research directions in cloud-based big data analytics.introductionrpThis is an age of big data and the emergence of this field of study has attracted the attention of many practitioners and researchers. Considering the rate at which data is being created in the digital world, big data analytics and analysis have become all the more relevant. Moreover, most of this data is already on the cloud. Therefore, shifting big data analytics to the cloud framework is a viable option.
Moreover, the cloud infrastructure suffices the storage and computing requirements of data analytics algorithms. On the other hand, open issues like security, privacy and the lack of ownership and control exist. Research studies in the area of cloud-based big data analytics aim to create an effective and efficient system that addresses the identified risks and concerns.conclusionrp[1] Agarwal, D., Das, S. and Abbadi, A.

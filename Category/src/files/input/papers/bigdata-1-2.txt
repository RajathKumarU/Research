Security Issues in Data Warehouse titlerpData Warehouse (DWH) provides storage for huge amounts of historical data from heterogeneous
operational sources in the form of multidimensional views, thus supplying sensitive and useful information which
help decision-makers to improve the organization’s business processes. A data warehouse environment must ensure
that data collected and stored in one big repository are not vulnerable. A review of security approaches specifically for
data warehouse environment and issues concerning each type of security approach have been provided in this paper.abstractrpdata warehouse, security issues, data integrity, privacy, confidentialitykeywordsrpIn today’s competitive business environment,
organizations need to collaborate with each other and
track their performance for market trend analysis. With
the help of advances in computer and network
technology, organizations stores, collect, and analyze
vast amounts of data efficiently and quickly. Data are
analyzed by the organization not only for market trend
identification, but also to examine the effectiveness of
their activities and to make decisions that affect their
bottom line. Therefore, data management has become
crucial because organizations not only need to store and
retrieve data, but also need to derive meaningful
information from it. As a consequence, organizations
have come to depend more on knowledge management
technologies such as interoperable knowledge
management, knowledge repositories, and data
warehouses (DWH).
A data warehouse may contain massive amounts of
organizational data such as financial information, credit
card numbers, organization trade secrets, and personal
data, thus they are vulnerable to cyber attack [1]. A
DWH must ensure that sensitive data does not fall into
the wrong hands when data are consolidated into one
big repository and become an easy target for malicious
outside or inside attackers. Many published security
statistics show that the number of attacks on data is
increasing continuously [2]. Data security focusses
mainly on three issues: confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, these concepts are also know by the
acronym CIA.
Confidentiality emphasizes protection of
information from unauthorized disclosure, either by
indirect logical inference or by direct retrieval [3].
Integrity involves data protection from accidental or
malicious changes such as false data insertion,
contamination, or destruction. Availability ensures that
data are accessible to all authorized users at any time.
In the past, many data security solutions for databases
have been proposed.
Although available solutions have been proven to be
scientifically effective, they are infeasible or at least
inefficient for a DWH environment because this
environment requires specific performance. Most of
today’s DWH security solutions lack effective security
procedures to protect the data accessed through them.
Existing security methods can be best for restricting
security breaches, but cannot completely eliminate the
risk.
In this paper, we present a survey of the security
approaches available for DWHs and the issues
concerning each type of security approach. The
remainder of the paper is organized into two sections.
In Section 2, various existing data security solutions for
DWHs are presented, and specific issues in the DWH
environment are discussed. Finally, Section 3 concludes
the paper and highlights future research directions.introductionrpThis study has provided a literature review of existing
DWH security solutions, discussing their issues and
their impact on DWH scalability and performance
requirements. It has become apparent that the proposed
solutions are infeasible or inefficient for use in DWH
environments. A DWH requires specific functionality
with tight scalability and performance requirements. A
complete solution is therefore needed that makes it
possible to address these directives. DWH security is an
active research relevance to any industrial project.
Further research in DWH security is needed to address
the issues discussed above because many more aspects
remain to be considered, and there many open
questions to be answered.conclusionrp[1] H. Inmon, Building the Data Warehouse, 3rd ed.,

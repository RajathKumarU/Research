Data Mining with Big Data titlerpBig Data concerns large-volume, complex, growing data sets with multiple, autonomous sources. With the fast development of networking, data storage, and the data collection capacity, Big Data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including physical, biological and bio-medical sciences. This article presents a HACE theorem that characterizes the features of the Big Data revolution, and proposes a Big Data processing model, from the data mining perspective. This data-driven model involves demand-driven aggregation of information sources, mining and analysis, user interest modeling, and security and privacy considerations. We analyze the challenging issues in the data-driven model and also in the Big Data revolution.abstractrp keywordsrp Dr. Yan Mo won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. This is probably the most controversial Nobel prize of this category, as Mo speaks Chinese, lives in a socialist country, and has the Chinese government’s support. Searching on Google with “Yan Mo Nobel Prize”, we get 1,050,000 web pointers on the Internet (as of January 3, 2013). “For all praises as well as criticisms,” said Mo recently, “I am grateful.” What types of praises and criticisms has Mo actually received over his 31-year writing career? As comments keep coming on the Internet and in various news media, can we summarize all types of opinions in different media in a real-time fashion, including updated, cross-referenced discussions by critics? This type of summarization program is an excellent example for Big Data processing, as the information comes from multiple, heterogeneous, autonomous sources with complex and evolving relationships, and keeps growing.
Along with the above example, the era of Big Data has arrived (Nature Editorial 2008; Mervis J. 2012; Labrinidis and Jagadish 2012). Every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created and 90% of the
2
data in the world today were produced within the past two years (IBM 2012). Our capability for data generation has never been so powerful and enormous ever since the invention of the Information Technology in the early 19th century. As another example, on October 4, 2012, the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney triggered more than 10 million tweets within two hours (Twitter Blog 2012). Among all these tweets, the specific moments that generated the most discussions actually revealed the public interests, such as the discussions about Medicare and vouchers. Such online discussions provide a new means to sense the public interests and generate feedback in real-time, and are mostly appealing compared to generic media, such as radio or TV broadcasting. Another example is Flickr, a public picture sharing site, which received 1.8 million photos per day, on average, from February to March 2012 (Michel F. 2012). Assuming the size of each photo is 2 megabytes (MB), this resulted in 3.6 terabytes (TB) storage every single day. As “a picture is worth a thousand words”, the billions of pictures on Flicker are a treasure tank for us to explore the human society, social events, public affairs, disasters etc., only if we have the power to harness the enormous amount of data.
The above examples demonstrate the rise of Big Data applications where data collection has grown tremendously and is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process within a “tolerable elapsed time”. The most fundamental challenge for the Big Data applications is to explore the large volumes of data and extract useful information or knowledge for future actions (Rajaraman and Ullman, 2011). In many situations, the knowledge extraction process has to be very efficient and close to real-time because storing all observed data is nearly infeasible. For example, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) (Dewdney et al. 2009) in Radio Astronomy consists of 1,000 to 1,500 15-meter dishes in a central 5km area. It provides 100 times more sensitive vision than any existing radio telescopes, answering fundamental questions about the Universe. However, with a 40 gigabytes(GB)/second data volume, the data generated from the SKA is exceptionally large. Although researchers have confirmed that interesting patterns, such as transient radio anomalies (Reed et al. 2011) can be discovered from the SKA data, existing methods are incapable of handling this Big Data. As a result, the unprecedented data volumes require an effective data analysis and prediction platform to achieve fast-response and real-time classification for such Big Data.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we propose a HACE theorem to model Big Data characteristics. Section 3 summarizes the key challenges for Big Data mining. Some key research initiatives and the authors’ national research projects in this field are outlined in Section 4. Related work is discussed in Section 5, and we conclude the paper in Section 6.introductiorpDriven by real-world applications and key industrial stakeholders and initialized by national funding agencies, managing and mining Big Data have shown to be a challenging yet very compelling task. While the term Big Data literally concerns about data volumes, our HACE theorem suggests that the key characteristics of the Big Data are (1) huge with heterogeneous and diverse data sources, (2) autonomous with distributed and decentralized control, and (3) complex and evolving in data and knowledge associations. Such combined characteristics suggest that Big Data requires a “big mind” to consolidate data for maximum values (Jacobs 2009).
In order to explore Big Data, we have analyzed several challenges at the data, model, and system levels. To support Big Data mining, high performance computing platforms are required which impose systematic designs to unleash the full power of the Big Data. At the data level, the autonomous information sources and the variety of the data collection environments, often result in data with complicated conditions, such as missing/uncertain values. In other situations, privacy concerns, noise and errors can be introduced into the data, to produce altered data copies. Developing a safe and sound information sharing protocol is a major challenge. At the model level, the key challenge is to generate global models by combining locally discovered patterns to form a unifying view. This requires carefully designed algorithms to analyze model correlations between distributed sites, and fuse decisions from multiple sources to gain a best model out of the Big Data. At the system level, the essential challenge is that a Big Data mining framework needs to consider complex relationships between samples, models, and
22
data sources, along with their evolving changes with time and other possible factors. A system needs to be carefully designed so that unstructured data can be linked through their complex relationships to form useful patterns, and the growth of data volumes and item relationships should help form legitimate patterns to predict the trend and future.
We regard Big Data as an emerging trend and the need for Big Data mining is arising in all science and engineering domains. With Big Data technologies, we will hopefully be able to provide most relevant and most accurate social sensing feedback to better understand our society at real-time. We can further stimulate the participation of the public audiences in the data production circle for societal and economical events. The era of Big Data has arrived.conclusionrp1) Ahmed and Karypis 2012, Rezwan Ahmed, George Karypis, Algorithms for mining the evolution of conserved relational states in dynamic networks, Knowledge and Information Systems, December 2012, Volume 33, Issue 3, pp 603-630

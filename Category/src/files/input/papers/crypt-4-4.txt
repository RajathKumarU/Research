Technical report: Security of Online Banking SystemstitlerpTechnology keeps evolving to better support our everyday life. This also
includes technology to manage nances. Online banking allows customers to
access banking services not only from computers at home or work, but also
almost anywhere using mobile devices. In the last few years, mobile devices
have seen a great increase in adoption by banks and their customers for online
banking due to their capabilities, aordability and usability. This report
discusses the security of today's online banking systems. Our focus is on both
online banking using home and oce computers, and mobile banking using
devices such as smartphones and tablets. We compare our ndings with a
similar examination of a decade ago and present an overview of security issues
in online and mobile banking that exist today. The most important trends
that we notice is that banks do improve security only after improvements
in functionality are made, and that eorts so far did not solve the larger
underlying issues.abstractrponline banking, mobile banking, WWW security, mobile
security, multi-factor authenticationkeywordsrpOnline banking systems have become quite popular in the last ten years.
Customers from an online bank can manage their accounts with their own
electronic devices as long as an Internet connection is available. Activities
such as checking the balance of an account and the initiation of money trans-
actions do not require human assistance from a clerk at the bank. Managing
a bank account is not limited anymore to oce hours.
Neither time nor location is an issue. Online banking systems are not
limited to personal computers for customer interaction. Mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablets allow customers to conduct banking activities
'on-the-go'. Mobile browsers and dedicated standalone applications allow
people to use the Internet to connect to the bank's systems in a similar way
to online banking with a PC.
1.1. About this document
This technical report is a result of our worldwide survey of security aspects
in online banking. Its main focus is on our detailed ndings and background
descriptions. A more condensed version of this report is the basis for our
journal article.
The target group for this report includes researchers with specic interests
in security aspects that are practiced today. Examples include the use of
SSL/TLS and (combinations of) authentication methods. Those who are
only interested in developments of online banking security can also read the
journal article.
1.2. Problem statement
We dene two problems in online banking to which the contents of this
report apply. The problem that is tangible and measurable is the nancial
fraud problem in online banking. Customers and banks lose money through
illegitimate transactions. A less tangible and more dicult to quantify prob-
lem is the loss of privacy. Attackers that gain access to bank accounts have
access to sensitive and incriminating information, such as account balances,
transaction histories and information about debt. More information on how
the identied issues in online banking contribute to the stated problems is
given in Section 4.4 on page 47.1.3. Scope of the report
This report discusses security technology and security usability in today's
online banking systems. As a continuation of the work of Claessens et al. [1],
the main focus will be on online and mobile banking.
An extensive worldwide survey of today's online banking systems provides
the base of our work. We applied a scope similar to the work of Claessens
et al. with a larger sample size by surveying available online banking systems
all over the globe and the possible methods of interaction that are available
to customers. The perspective of this report is from the side of the customer
when dealing with online banking. Only publicly available information was
used in our survey.81 banks that provide online payment services were examined. See Fig-
ure 1 for an overview of the global distribution between North and South
America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, East-Asia and Oceania.
Samples were collected by searching for banks on the Internet. Search cri-
teria were based on global representation and type of bank. Our focus was
on banks that provide account and payment services to consumers and small
businesses. Data was collected between March and September in 2013. If a
specic geographical area was targeted, individual banks were selected from
the pool of banks that provide payment services. Several banks were included based on economical size if this information was available. If this informa-
tion was used, other random banks from the same region were also added.
We explicitly added the larger banks where possible in the assumption that
they have the most assets to protect (such as the number of customers or the
amount of money) and are therefore a desired target. By including them in
addition to random (smaller) banks, we think that our sample set is represen-
tative for online banking systems aimed at consumers and small businesses
for the time period in which we conducted our research. In regions where the
size of banks was not obtainable, we used a random selection. Language bar-
riers were overcome by colleagues who translated critical information from
documentation that we provided and by automated translation tools.
Due to technical, security and usability dierences between the dierent
types of customer devices, a distinction is made throughout this report be-
tween the use of personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices (MDs) by
online banking customers. Of the banks in our set, 80 are examined on how
they facilitate the use of the customer's PC.1 The same was done for MDs
with 67 banks in our set.2 Figure 1 makes a distinction between banks that
were examined for the services they provide for both PCs and MDs, and for
banks that were only examined for one of these types of devices.
1.4. Outline of the report
The rest of the report after the introduction is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we will give an overview of dierent aspects concerning online
banking today and oset it to the developments ten years ago as described
by Claessens et al. in [1]. This section rst summarizes how popular online
banking is and gives an indication about the increase of fraud. The archi-
tecture of today's online banking is explained, including applied authentica-
tion methods for online banking on both PCs and MDs. A focus is given
on the applied authentication factors. These can be knowledge ('something
you know'), possession ('something you have') and existence ('something you
are').Section 3 continues with an overview of attack vectors applied against
online banking. These vectors either misuse or work around the described
authentication methods mentioned in the previous section. After this, an
analysis is given in Section 4 of the underlying security issues that provide
the largest impact on the nancial fraud and privacy problems in online
banking.
Section 5 contains our concluding remarks.
1.5. Our contribution
Our work gives an indication of the state of online banking worldwide and
its current vulnerable aspects. Conclusions about the evolution of function-
ality versus security in online nancial services are made by comparing the
work of Claessens et al. in [1] with our work. Further research can use the
dened security issues and problems in online banking as a rst step towards
improvement.introductionrpThe security issues that we discussed relate to the issues as discussed
by Claessens et al. in [1]: the establishment of a secure channel for data
condentiality and integrity, and the authentication of the customer (entity
authentication) and each transaction (transaction authentication).
Claessens et al. concluded for the rst issue that SSL/TLS was used by
most banks and proven to be a practically secure protocol from a crypto-
graphic point of view. While we have noted several issues in SSL/TLS as
it is used in today's online banking, this conclusion still stands due to that
exploiting weaknesses in SSL/TLS communication requires a vast amount of
resources to attack a limited number of targets compared to other discussed
approaches (see Section 3.3 on page 40 for more information).
The other attack vectors are the reason why the technical infrastructure
for communication security must not be scoped as only the connection be-
tween customer and bank devices. The devices have to be included, for they
48
are also (and more, compared to SSL/TLS) vulnerable to attacks that chal-
lenge condentiality and integrity of the communication between customer
and bank. In 2002, Claessens et al. noted that the best security solution for
online banking relies on the assumption that the end-points of the system
are trusted. In our article, we noted the persistent man-in-the-middle, rep-
resented by the client computer used by the customer. A bank cannot trust
the client computer as an end-point since it cannot provide a trusted and
guaranteed untampered environment for online banking.
Banks take advantage of web standards to reach a large number of online
banking customers that use PCs and MDs. Many banks also provide online
banking applications for MDs. This use of customer-owned PCs and MDs
must be considered insecure by banks. All client-side code (including web
browsers and banking applications) is executed in an environment that can-
not guarantee condentiality or integrity, because third-parties can inuence
what customers and banks see through PCs and MDs (see Section 3.2 on
page 37 for more information). The client computer cannot be removed from
online banking since it is an important aspect that allows banks to electroni-
cally reach large audiences. Therefore, the current best practice is that banks
do not rely on client computers for entity and transaction authentication to
prevent fraud attacks.
As their second issue, Claessens et al. concluded that xed passwords
were the most widely used method for authentication. It was noted that the
best practice at the time was probably the use of hardware tokens or the use
of a smart card for challenge-response authentication and creating digital
signatures. One third of the banks in our survey apply the best practices
from 2002 in 2013. The majority that does not apply the best practices
still implement some form of multi-factor authentication (see Section 2.5 on
page 25 for more information). While the use of only xed passwords for
authentication with PCs is still seen at almost a quarter of all examined
banks, the majority of banks oer some form of multi-factor authentication.
However, multi-factor authentication is not enough. Current implemen-
tations of it do conrm customer identity, but not intention. Actions them-
selves and the results of actions of the customer do not have to conform
with the intention of the customer. Customer can be tricked through social
engineering to do something that they do not want. Also, if a customer initi-
ates an action with genuine intent, it is possible for an attacker through the
persistent man-in-the-middle (the customer's device) to modify the result-
ing information from that action before a bank receives it. It is not always
49
possible to dierentiate between both types of attack due to the lack of non-
repudiation of the customer's actions. To get more insight in nancial fraud,
it is required to non-repudiate bank transactions. This will not prevent fraud
completely since it is still possible through social engineering. However, it
does prevent that a party other than the customer changes the outcome of
the customer's actions (such as by changing a destination account number
or the sum of a transaction).
Similar to Claessens et al. we close our work by noting that perfect se-
curity cannot be achieved. Online bank fraud will most likely always exist
in some form as long as online banking exists. However, there is room for
improvement on how security threats and opportunities are handled.
Banks have shown eort in attempts to improve security, but overall
security has not increased. This is because security is often an afterthought
after something is implemented. Eorts therefore often go towards xing
existing problems in newly oered functionality. Putting the right amount of
eort at the right time in securing the vulnerable parts of the attack surface
that need it can reduce the impact of both existing and new attack methods.
Determining underlying (potential) issues based on the symptoms should be
given proper attention before steps towards improvements are taken.
Improving security is not something that only has to be done once. A
continuing process is required that monitors and categorizes threats and op-
portunities. Security must be given the same priority as functionality and
not tag along as a nuisance that is based on only the problems that were
relevant a decade ago.conclusionrp[1] Joris Claessens, Valentin Dem, Danny De Cock, Bart Preneel, and Joos

The Anatomy of Big Data ComputingtitlerpAdvances in information technology and its widespread growth in several areas of business, engineering, medical and scientific studies are resulting in information/data explosion. Knowledge discovery and decision making from such rapidly growing voluminous data is a challenging task in terms of data organization and processing, which is an emerging trend known as Big Data Computing; a new paradigm which combines large scale compute, new data intensive techniques and mathematical models to build data analytics. Big Data computing demands a huge storage and computing for data curation and processing that could be delivered from on-premise or clouds infrastructures. This paper discusses the evolution of Big Data computing, differences between traditional data warehousing and Big Data, taxonomy of Big Data computing and underpinning technologies, integrated platform of Big Data and Clouds known as Big Data Clouds, layered architecture and components of Big Data Cloud and finally discusses open technical challenges and future directions.abstractrpBig Data, Big Data Computing, Big Data Analytics as a Service (BDaaS), Big Data Cloud architecture.keywordsrpBig Data computing is an emerging data science paradigm of multi dimensional information mining for scientific discovery and business analytics over large scale infrastructure. The data collected/produced from several scientific explorations and business transactions often require tools to facilitate efficient data management, analysis, validation, visualization and dissemination, while preserving the intrinsic value of the data [1] - [5]. The IDC [6] report predicted that there could be an increase of the digital data by 40 times from 2012 to 2020. New advancements in semiconductor technologies are eventually leading to faster computing, large scale storage, faster and powerful networks at lower prices, enabling large volumes of data preservation and utilization at faster rate. Recent advancements in Cloud computing technologies are enabling to preserve, every bit of the gathered and processed data, based on subscription models, providing high availability of storage and computation at affordable price. Conventional data warehousing systems are based on pre-determined analytics over the abstracted data, and employs cleansing and transforming into another database known as data marts- which are periodically updated with the similar type of rolled-up data. However, Big Data systems work on non predetermined analytics; hence no need of data cleansing and transformations procedures.
Big Data organizes and extracts the valued information from the rapidly growing, large volumes, variety forms, and frequently changing data sets collected from multiple, and autonomous sources in the minimal possible time, using several statistical, and machine learning techniques. Big Data is characterized by 5V’s such as Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value. Big Data and traditional data warehousing systems, however, have the similar goals to deliver business value through the analysis of data, but, they differ in the analytics methods and the organization of the data. In practice, data warehouses organize the data in the repository, by collecting it from other several databases like enterprise’s financial systems, customer marketing systems, billing systems, point-of-sale systems, etc.

Warehousing systems are poor on organizing and querying the data from the operational streaming data like click stream logs, sensor data, location data from mobile devices, customer support emails and chat transcripts, and surveillance videos etc. Big Data technologies overcome the weakness of the data warehousing systems, by harnessing new sources of data, thus facilitating enterprises analyze and extract intrinsic information through analytics. Big Data technology has gaining popularity in several domains of business, engineering and scientific computing areas, Philip et.al [8] presented a survey on Big Data along with opportunities and challenges for data intensive applications stated several areas and the importance of Big Data. M. Chen et.al [9] presented a survey on Big Data and its interrelated technologies like Clouds, Internet of Things (IOT), online social networks, medical applications, collective intelligence, and smart grid. J. Chen et.al [10] presented the Big Data technologies towards data management challenges like big data diversity, big data reduction, integration and cleaning, indexing and query, and several tools for analysis and mining. X. Wu et.al [11] presented Big Data processing model, from the data mining perspective. Kaiser et.al [12] discussed several issues in Big Data such as storage and data transport technologies followed by methodologies for Big Data Analytics. R. Buyya et.al [13] presented a survey on Big Data computing in Clouds and future research directions for the development of analytics and visualization tools in several domains of science, engineering and business.
As business domains are growing, there is a need to converge a new economic system redefining the relationships among producers, distributors and consumers of goods and services. Obviously, it is not feasible to depend on experience or pure intuition always, however, it is also essential to use critically important data sources for decision making. NIST Big Data Public Working Group described a survey of Big Data Architectures and Framework from the industry [14] . The several areas of Big Data computing are described below.
a) Scientific Explorations: The data collected from various sensors is analyzed to extract the useful information for societal benefits. E.g. physics and astronomical experiments- a large number of scientists collaborating for designing, operating and analyzing the products of sensor networks and detectors for scientific studies. Earth Observation Systems (EOS) - information gathering and analytical approaches about earth’s physical, chemical and biological systems via remote sensing technologies, to improve social and economic well-being and its applications for weather forecasting, monitoring and responding to natural disasters, and climate change predictions etc.
b) Healthcare: Healthcare organizations would like to predict the locations from where the diseases are spreading so as to prevent further spreading [15] . However, to predict exactly the origin of the disease would not be possible, until there is statistical data from several locations. In 2009, when a new flu virus similar to H1N1 was spreading, Google has predicted this and published a paper in the scientific journal Nature [16], by looking at what people were searching for, on the internet.
c) Governance: Surveillance system analyzing and classifying streaming acoustic signals, transportation departments using real-time traffic data to predict traffic patterns, update public transportation schedules. Security departments analyzing images from aerial cameras, news feeds, and social networks or items of interest. Social program agencies gain a clearer understanding of

beneficiaries and proper payments. Tax agencies identifying fraudsters and support investigation by analyzing complex identity information and tax returns. Sensor applications such stream air, water and temperature data to support cleanup, fire prevention and other programs.
d) Financial and Business Analytics: Retaining customers and satisfying consumer expectations are among the most serious challenges facing financial institutions. Sentiment analysis and predictive analysis would play a key role in several fields like travel industry- for optimal cost estimations, retail industry- products targeted for potential customers, Forecast analysis – estimating the best price estimations etc.
e) Web Analytics: Several web sites are experiencing millions of unique visitors per day, in turn creating a large range of content. Increasingly, companies want to be able mine this data to understand limitations of their sites, improve response time, offer more targeted ads and so on. This requires tools to perform complicated analytics on data that far exceeds the memory of a single machine or even in cluster of machines.
Service oriented technologies aka Cloud computing are delivering compute, storage and software applications as services over private or public networks based on pay-as-go delivery models [17] [18]. Cloud computing technologies becoming a reality, it is serving as a key enabler for Big Data to solve data intensive problems over a large scale infrastructure for information extraction. The integration of Big Data technologies and Cloud computing read as - “Big Data Clouds” is an emerging new generation data analytics platform for information mining, knowledge discovery and decision making. Hence, both the technologies put together, here, we discuss the evolution of Big Data technologies and compare it with traditional data warehousing technologies along with its relationship with Cloud computing technologies and infrastructure. We also discuss the architecture and reference framework for Big Data computing on Clouds. This paper is intended for researchers, technical audience of both developer and designers, and general readers who are interested in acquiring an in-depth knowledge of Big Data technology in IT.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the differences between Big Data and traditional data ware housing systems in, data handling, processing, storing, extracting etc. followed by CAP theorem- the fundamental principle of database system, and illustrate the ACID and BASE properties adopted for data warehousing (relational model) and Big Data models respectively. Later, we discuss the Big Data abstraction layers and compare it with the traditional data base model. Section 3 discusses taxonomy of Big Data computing, and presents a detailed study of several components of the taxonomy like analytics, frameworks, technologies, programming models, schedulers, processing tools etc. Section 4 illustrates an integrated platform for Big Data and Clouds followed by a layered architecture and its components. Here, we discuss elements of Big Data Cloud, Layered architecture and reference framework. Section 5 identifies open technical challenges, gap analysis and future research directions in data storage/handling, specific domain areas, new programming models and domain specific analytics development.introductionrpBig Data computing is an emerging platform for data analytics to address large scale multidimensional data for knowledge discovery and decision making. In this paper, we have studied, characterized and categorized several aspects of Big Data computing systems. Big Data technology is evolving and changing the present traditional data bases with effective data organization, large computing and data workloads processing with new innovative analytics tools bundled with statistical and machine learning techniques. With the maturity of Cloud computing technologies, Big Data technologies are accelerating in several areas of business, science and engineering to solve data intensive problems. We have enumerated several case studies of Big Data technologies in the areas of health care studies, business intelligence, social networking, and scientific explorations. Further, we focus on illustrating how Big Data databases differ from traditional data base and discuss BASE properties supported by them.
To understand Big Data paradigm, we presented taxonomy of Big Data computing along with discussion on characteristics, technologies, tools, security mechanisms, data organization, scheduling approaches, etc. along with relevant paradigms and technologies. Later we presented under pinning technologies for the evolution of Big Data and discussed how cloud computing technologies would be utilized for infrastructure services delivery for the analytics development. Later, we discussed an emerging Big Data computing platforms over Clouds, Big Data Clouds, an integrated technology from Big Data and Cloud computing, delivering Big Data computing as a service over large scale clouds. The paper also discussed types of Big Data clouds and illustrated Big Data access networks, an emerging data platform services for Big Data analytics.
Further on, we presented a layered architecture, components under each of the layers followed by technologies to be addressed under each of the layers. We then compare some of the existing systems in each of the areas and categorize them based on the tools and services rendered to the users. In doing so, we have gained an insight into the architecture, strategies and practices that are currently followed in Big Data computing. Also, through our characterization and detailed study, we are able to discover some of the short comings and identify gaps in the current architectures and systems. These represent some of the directions that could be followed in future. Thus, this paper lays down a comprehensive classification framework that not only serves as a tool to understanding this emerging area but also presents a reference to which future efforts can be mapped.
To conclude, Big Data technologies are being adopted widely for information exploitation with the help of new analytics tools and large scale computing infrastructure to process huge variety of multi-dimensional data in several areas ranging from business intelligence to scientific explorations. However, more research needs to be undertaken, in several areas like data organization, decision making, domain specific tools and platform tools to create next generation Big Data infrastructure for enabling users to extract maximum utility out of large the volumes of available information and data.conclusionrp[1] J.

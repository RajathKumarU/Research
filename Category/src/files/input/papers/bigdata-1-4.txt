Adaptive, Secure, and Scalable Distributed Data
Outsourcing: A Vision PapertitlerpThe growing trend towards grid computing and cloud com-
puting provides enormous potential for enabling dynamic,
distributed and data-intensive applications such as sharing
and processing of large-scale scientific data. It also creates
an increasing challenge for automatically and dynamically
placing the data in the globally distributed computers or
data centers in order to optimally utilize resources while
minimizing user-perceived latency. This challenge is further
complicated by the security and privacy constraints on the
data that are potential sensitive. In this paper, we present
our vision of an adaptive, secure, and scalable data outsourc-
ing framework for storing and processing massive, dynamic,
and potentially sensitive data using distributed resources.
We identify the main technical challenges and present some
preliminary solutions. The key idea of the framework is that
it combines data partitioning, encryption, and data reduc-
tion to ensure data confidentiality and privacy while mini-
mizing the cost for data shipping and computation. We be-
lieve the framework will provide a holistic conceptual foun-
dation for secure data outsourcing that enables dynamic,
distributed, and data-intensive applications and will open
up many exciting research challenges.abstractrpprivacy preserving data publishing, secure data outsourcing,

puting is offering both new opportunities and challenges for
enabling dynamic, distributed and data-intensive (D3) ap-
plications such as sharing and processing of large-scale sci-
entific data. Researchers or data collectors can outsource
their massive data as well as data processing tasks to grid re-
sources or the enormous data centers offered by cloud provi-
ders, exemplified by Google AppEngine, Amazon’s EC2 and
Microsoft’s Azure. Such a computing paradigm also creates
an increasing challenge for automatically and dynamically
placing the data in the globally distributed computers or
data centers in order to optimally utilize the resources while
minimizing user-perceived latency. This challenge is further
complicated by the security and privacy constraints on the
data. Indeed, data security is widely recognized as a major
barrier for widespread adoption of deploying data into open
distributed systems, e.g. clouds [32, 5, 36]. Users are reluc-
tant to place their sensitive data in the cloud with concerns
about data disclosure to potentially untrusted cloud provi-
ders and other malicious parties. Untrusted cloud providers
may scan cloud users’ data and even sell them. New threats
also arise from the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure based
on virtual machines (VMs) as the resources are shared with
other potentially malicious tenants. In fact, a recent study
[39] showed a cross-VM attack that can effectively target
and extract confidential information from specific cloud in-
stances. Biocompute is an example grid-based system that
leverages grid-computing resources composed of a large net-
work of personal computers for solving large bioinformatics
problems [11]. The amount of data delivered by the Biocom-
pute triggers new challenges for its developers. In addition,
the possibility of opening Biocompute for external users’ use
will raise many privacy concerns.
Not surprisingly, part of the data confidentiality issues
in the distributed outsourcing reflects the well-established
security challenges in the traditional data outsourcing or
Database-as-a-Service (DAS) setting in which a client out-
sources its data to a remote untrusted database server which
is then responsible for their storage and management [42].
A common approach is to encrypt the data before sending
them to a remote server. Many techniques (such as [44, 28,
27, 12, 30, 4, 8, 31]) focus on supporting specific queries on
encrypted database. The recent break-through of the fully
homomorphic encryption scheme[24, 25, 46] bears the poten-
tial to allow a user to store fully encrypted data while en-
abling arbitrary computations on the encrypted data, how-
ever, its computation cost is prohibitive in practice. It re-
mains an open challenge to support versatile and efficient
computation on the outsourced data with assurances of data
confidentiality and data privacy.
For secure data outsourcing to distributed resources, a
potential solution is the secret sharing scheme [43] that dis-
tributes the original data into shares and each can be placed
on a resource. However, the limitation that each share of
the secret must be at least as large as the secret itself makes
it not feasible for large scale data. Several works studied
data partitioning that allow partial or no encryption [3, 15,
16, 10, 14]. While they mitigate the performance impact
of cryptographic operations, the security guarantees on the
unencrypted data warrants further research.
In addition, data outsourcing to distributed resources such
as cloud brings about new opportunities and challenges. Ac-
cording to the NIST definition [35], key characteristics of
cloud computing include on-demand service, broad network
access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and metered ser-
vice similar to a utility. In other words, what differentiates
cloud-hosting providers from traditional hosting providers is
their ability to offer elastic resources [36] which can respond
to dynamic data volumes. This also challenges us to reexam-
ine the existing solutions and design next generation secure
data outsourcing techniques that allow users to rapidly and
dynamically provision their resource needs for outsourcing
and realize the full potential of the elasticity and pay-per-use
of the cloud.

Contributions. We present our vision of an adaptive, se-
cure, and scalable data outsourcing framework for sharing
and processing of massive, dynamic, and potentially sen-
sitive data using distributed resources. Figure 1 depicts an
example cloud outsourcing setting in which a user outsources
its data to distributed data centers or resource providers for
data storage and management. We identify the main tech-
nical challenges and present some preliminary solutions.
1. Secure and scalable outsourcing design that combine
data partitioning, encryption, and data reduction such
as compressed or statistical data outsourcing to en-
sure data confidentiality and privacy while minimizing
the cost for data shipping and computation. Each re-
source provider may store parts of the data in original,
encrypted, or reduced form. Algorithms can be devel-
oped to allow users to preprocess their data for secure
outsourcing on distributed resource providers that sys-
tematically balance the requirements on confidential-
ity and privacy, scalability, and analytical utility of the
data for a given workload.
2. Adaptive outsourcing design that allow users to dy-
namically provision their outsourcing needs with data
updates and changing query workload. Control-theory
based mechanisms can be developed to effectively mo-
del and estimate the changing query workload and
changing data for dynamically adjusting the outsourc-
ing design.
We believe the framework will provide a holistic concep-
tual foundation for secure data outsourcing that enables
large scale sharing and processing of massive and poten-
tially sensitive data on distributed data centers. We expect
that this paper will open up exciting perspectives for future
systems and database research on D3 applications.introductionrpWe presented an adaptive, secure, and scalable data out-
sourcing framework for sharing and processing of massive,
dynamic, and potentially sensitive data using distributed
resources. It creates exciting research opportunities for de-
signing new outsourcing design techniques as well as sys-
tems techniques that make different types of cloud and lo-
cal platforms compatible, host practical manifestations of
remote databases, and perform at optimal levels in order
to make the technology eminently usable. We believe the
research direction is exciting in its potential to be transfor-
mative in terms of dramatically increasing usability of dis-
tributed computational platforms and making “information
processing as a utility” a reality. For the foreseeable future,
user confidence in data security and confidentiality will be
a critical factor in determining adoption; at the same time,
acquiring storage and compute resources from professional
providers is technologically and economically optimal. Rec-
onciling these two aspects has significant implications.conclusionrp[1] M. Abdalla, M. Bellare, D. Catalano, E. Kiltz, T. Kohno,

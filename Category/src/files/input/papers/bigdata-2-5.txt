Secure Data Storage for Mobile Data Collection Systems titlerp Wireless network infrastructures, notably cellular networks,
are becoming a vital element for exchanging electronic data
in low income countries. Several key sectors are already
leveraging on cellular networks: mobile nancial transac-
tions have already gained an enormous success, and the
health care sector is also aiming to tackle outstanding chal-
lenges like providing basic health care services to remote
communities, by using cheap mobile devices. So far, more
than ten mobile based health care services are deployed in
low-income countries. Among those, mobile data collection
is the one used to replace traditional paper form based data
collection with electronic digital forms by the use of Mo-
bile Data Collection Systems (MDCS). However, although
such systems are often used to collect sensitive health-related
data, critical issues like security and privacy of personal data
have not been systematically addressed. Particularly, very
little has been done to protect data while stored on the
phone. This paper focuses on low budget mobile phones
with low hardware and software specication, and proposes
adequate secure solutions for data storage protection. Our
secure storage scheme is exible enough to be integrated in
existing mobile client applications. The solution has been
extensively tested and integrated into a production MDCS.
For this work, we collaborated with the open-source mobile
data collection project, openXdata.abstractrp mHealth, Mobile Data Collection Systems, Mobile Security,

munication devices in the context of health is an emerging
part of eHealth. A report by the United Nations Foundation and Vodafone Foundation [23] suggests that close to half the
population in low-income countries own or have access to
mobile phones. Health care in these nations can be scarce
or dicult to access due to restraints such as limited re-
sources, nances and health care workforce, or parts of the
population living in remote locations. High mobile phone
penetration makes mHealth a viable option for providing
better health care through Mobile Health (a.k.a mHealth)
systems.
Leveraging mHealth systems makes it possible to cost-
eectively provide services like:
General education and awareness through, for instance,
SMS.
Communicating with and training of health care work-
ers, even in remote locations.
Tracking of disease outbreaks or epidemics.
Diagnosing and assisting in treating patients remotely
when traveling to a hospital is not an option.
In this paper 1 we are mainly focused on a specic aspect
of mHealth, namely remote data collection. However, the
work presented is applicable in any context where secure
data storage is required.introductionrpIn general, all modern smart phones equipped with op-
erative systems like Blackberry, Android and iOS provide
a crypto API to develop secure applications. However, we
are developing a secure solution for the Java ME platform,
which lacks support for any kind of data security [3, 24], and
we target low-end phones, so that solutions that might be
adequate for high-end phone like smart phones, are not an
option in our context. The solution we implemented is based
on a custom protocol developed by considering the specic
constraints of MDCS [11], but it makes almost no assump-
tions about how or where data is stored, or how the com-
munication layer of an existing application is implemented.
This guarantees wide compatibility. Besides, the dierent
secure solutions that it oers are very modular, and can be
used independently to t the needs of MDCS with dierent
security requirements. Most of the secure API objects that
are exposed to the programmer are very similar to the Java
ME counterparts in terms of methods and behavior. This
means that any programmer who knows how to use the nor-
mal Java ME classes will also know how to use the secure
ones.
We have developed our own prototype MDCS using the
API, and tested it on various phones with dierent settings
in order to collect experimental data on the performance of
the API. The results are encouraging, since the performance
with the default security settings was acceptable also on very
low-end phones, and the openXdata integration is proceed-
ing smoothly. The secure solution has been integrated into
a production openXdata code base and ready to be tested
in the eld.
We have focused our research on feature phones instead of
smart phones because the market share of feature phones is
about 80countries [22], so it will take some time to migrate
to smart-phones, although prices are falling. Besides, there
are still many MDCS in use which leverage on a J2ME client,
and using our API is a simple way for them to quickly add
security to their existing system while they migrate to other
platforms.
Move to smart phones is inevitable, and openXdata com-
munity has started work to implement an Android client,
and we are collaborating to port our secure API to Android.conclusionrp[1] 3rd generation mobile telecommunications(3G).

Big data using cloud computingtitlerpBig Data is a data analysis methodology enabled by recent advances in technologies and architecture. However, big data entails a huge commitment of hardware and processing resources, making adoption costs of big data technology prohibitive to small and medium sized businesses. Cloud computing offers the promise of big data implementation to small and medium sized businesses.
Big Data processing is performed through a programming paradigm known as MapReduce. Typically, implementation of the MapReduce paradigm requires networked attached storage and parallel processing. The computing needs of MapReduce programming are often beyond what small and medium sized business are able to commit.
Cloud computing is on-demand network access to computing resources, provided by an outside entity. Common deployment models for cloud computing include platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and hardware as a service (HaaS).
The three types of cloud computing are the public cloud, the private cloud, and the hybrid cloud. A public cloud is the pay- as-you-go services. A private cloud is internal data center of a business not available to the general public but based on cloud structure. The hybrid cloud is a combination of the public cloud and private cloud.
Three major reasons for small to medium sized businesses to use cloud computing for big data technology implementation are hardware cost reduction, processing cost reduction, and ability to test the value of big data. The major concerns regarding cloud computing are security and loss of control.abstractrpBig data, cloud computing, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud keywordsrpBig Data is a data analysis methodology enabled by a new generation of technologies and architecture which support high-velocity data capture, storage, and analysis (Villars, Olofson, & Eastwood, 2011). Data sources extend beyond the traditional corporate database to include e-mail, mobile device output, sensor-generated data, and social media output (Villars, Olofson, & Eastwood, 2011). Data are no longer restricted to structured database records but include unstructured data – data having no standard formatting (Coronel, Morris, & Rob, 2013).
Big Data requires huge amounts of storage space. While the price of storage continued to decline, the resources needed to leverage big data can still pose financial difficulties for small to medium sized businesses. A typical big data storage and analysis infrastructure will be based on clustered network-attached storage (NAS) (White, 2011). Clustered NAS infrastructure requires configuration of several NAS “pods” with each NAS “pod” comprised of several storage devices connected to an NAS device (White, 2011). The series of NAS devices are then interconnected to allow massive sharing and searching of data (White, 2011).
Data storage using cloud computing is a viable option for small to medium sized businesses considering the use of Big Data analytic techniques. Cloud computing is on-demand network access to computing resources which are often provided by an outside entity and require little management effort by the business (IOS Press, 2011). A number of architectures and deployment models exist for cloud computing, and these architectures and models are able to be used with other technologies and design approaches (IOS Press, 2011). Owners of small to medium sized businesses who are unable to afford adoption of clustered NAS technology can consider a number of cloud computing models to meet their big data needs. Small to medium sized business owners need to consider the correct cloud computing in order to remain both competitive and profitable.introductionrpCloud computing enables small to medium sized business to implement big data technology with a reduced commitment of company resources. The processing capabilities of the big data model could provide new insights to the business pertaining to performance improvement, decision making support, and innovation in business models, products, and services. Benefits of implementing big data technology through cloud computing are cost savings in hardware and processing, as well as the ability to experiment with big data technology before making a substantial commitment of company resources. Several models of cloud computing services are available to the businesses to consider, with each model having trade-offs between the benefit of cost savings and the concerns data security and loss of control.conclusionrpArmbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.

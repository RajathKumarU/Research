Mining Big Data to Predicting FuturetitlerpDue to technological advances, vast data sets (e.g. big data) are increasing now days. Big Data a new term; is used
to identify the collected datasets. But due to their large size and complexity, we cannot manage with our current
methodologies or data mining software tools to extract those datasets. Such datasets provide us with unparalleled
opportunities for modelling and predicting of future with new challenges. So as an awareness of this and
weaknesses as well as the possibilities of these large data sets, are necessary to forecast the future. Today’s we
have an overwhelming growth of data in terms of volume, velocity and variety on web. Moreover this, from a
security and privacy views, both area have an unpredictable growth. So Big Data challenge is becoming one of the
most exciting opportunities for researchers in upcoming years.
Hence this paper discuss about this topic in a broad overview like; its current status; controversy; and challenges to
forecast the future. This paper defines at some of these problems, using illustrations with applications from various
areas. Finally this paper discuss secure management and privacy of big data as one of essential issues.abstractrpBig data, data mining, Large datasets; Internet of things.keywordsrpRecent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our
ability to collect data from various sensors, devices in
multiple formats, from independent or connected
applications [1, 2 and 3]. This data has outpaced our
capability to process, analyze, store and understand
these datasets [2]. For e.g. Internet data. Imagine that,
the web pages indexed by Google were around 1
million in 1998, but quickly it reached 1 billion in
2000 and 1 trillion in 2008 and so on. So this rapid
expansion is accelerated by the dramatic increase in
acceptance of social networking applications, such as
Facebook, Twitter etc., that allow users to create
contents freely and amplify the already huge Web
volume and give an overview to predict the future of
users. Based on this, these companies read mind of
their users like to providing ads. Furthermore, with
mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get
real-time data on people from different aspects, the
vast amount of data that mobile carrier can potentially
process to improve our daily life has significantly
outpaced our past CDR (Call Data Record)-based
processing for billing purposes only [1, 2 and 3].
It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT)
applications will raise the scale of data to an
unprecedented level. People and devices (from home
coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and
airports) are all loosely connected [1, 2, 3]. Trillions of
such connected components generates a huge data
ocean; by that valuable information can be discover to
help people and to improve the quality of their life and
to make this world a better place for them for e.g. after
we get up in every morning, in order to optimize our
commute time to work and complete the optimization
before we arrive at once, the system needs to process
information from traffic, weather, construction, police
activities to our calendar schedules.
After that we perform our deep optimization schedule
under the tight time constraints.Figure 1 shows the relation among various types of
data existed in this real world. With the rapid
increment in sensor technologies, mobile, cloud and
high speed computing, we have already witnessed the
emergence of the Big Data era [4]. While the immense volume of data being produced at exponential rates by plethora of increasingly heterogeneous computing devices and sensors, that constitutes the Internet of Things (IoT), show huge potential for the better understanding of various phenomena and events through predictive data analytics[4]. The same data can be significantly misused and exploited for harvesting privacy sensitive information, or affecting the veracity or integrity of results of data analytics that will be used by people and enterprises for decision making purposes or predicting future. The diversity of data sources introduces immense variety in the media types such as text, images, videos and variations within these; further, establishing reliability and trustworthiness, as well as completeness of data from different sources become very difficult [4]. These exacerbate the problem of ensuring overall quality of data and information related to an individual or an enterprise throughout its lifecycle. The richness of multimedia data generates unique privacy risks as they can be correlated to reveal very sensitive information [4]. The velocity with which multimedia data flows through the networks and devices enabled by rapid advances in mobile and cloud computing, and networking technologies, which adds another level of challenge w.r.t to securely processing potentially inaccurate, unfiltered data in motion. The increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data and the increasing challenge with regards to establishing veracity of such data, present an unprecedented level of security and privacy challenges [4]. In particular, the threat landscape has been seen an immense growth resulting in a significant increase in number of threats witnessed in short periods of time [4]. This rapid growth in the threat spectrum have also resulted in many sophisticated hacker tools and cyber criminals that never existed before. Seen along with such increase in threats are also many sophisticated hacker tools, which if coupled with emerging big data analytics tools, will enable cyber criminals to acquire computing resources to create large scale security incidents that never existed before [4]. Today’s we have been witnessing an overwhelming growth of data in terms of volume, velocity and variety, interestingly So from a security and privacy standpoint view, the threat landscape; security and privacy risks have also seen an unprecedented growth. Privacy is a pillar of democracy, we must remain alert to the possibility that it might be compromised by the rise of new technologies, and put in place all necessary safeguards [5, 6]. It is discussed as a main issue in this paper.
But in all these applications, we are facing various significant challenges in leveraging the vast amount of data, including challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic design (3) business models (4) security (5) privacy. As an example, Big Data is having in the data mining community, which is being considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the years to come [3]. Moreover this, Secure Management of Big Data with today’s threat spectrum is also a biggest challenging problem. This paper shows that significant research effort is needed to build a generic architectural framework towards addressing these security and privacy challenges in a holistic manner as future work. Finally this paper introduce Big Data mining and its applications in Section 2. We summarize the papers presented in this issue in Section 3, and discuss about Big Data problems in Section 4. Section 5 discuss about Big Data controversy. We point the importance of open-source software tools in Section 6 and give some challenges and forecast to the future in Section 7. Finally Section 8 conclude this paper.introductionrpDue to increasing the size of data day by day, Big Data is going to continue growing during the next years and becoming one of the exciting opportunities in future. This paper insights about the topic, and controversy, and the main challenges etc. for the future. Hence Big Data is becoming the new Final Frontier for scientific data research and for business applications. And on challenging side, Securely Management of Big Data with today’s threat spectrum is a big issue. Because today’s we have an overwhelming growth of data in terms of volume, velocity and variety. So from a security and privacy standpoint, the threat landscape and security and privacy risks have also seen an unprecedented growth. So as for future research is needed to build a generic architectural framework towards addressing these security and privacy challenges in a holistic manner. Now we are in a new era where Big Data mining will help us to discover knowledge that no one has discovered before. So everybody is warmly invited to participate in this intrepid journey to discover the future views.conclusionrp[1.] http://big-data-mining.org/

Internet Banking Authentication Methods in Nigeria Commercial BankstitlerpThe Electronic banking and payments services of commercial banks are recognised by the Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN). Despite the early stage of electronic banking in Nigeria, banks are already offering various financial services
through the internet. In order to protect customers’ vital information and identities over the internet, necessary and
standard multifactor authentication measures should be in place to avoid financial losses. The purpose of this study is to
find out the multifactor authentication (MFA) methods used by the banks, evaluate the type of security mechanism
adopted and develop security measures to reliably authenticate customers remotely accessing their Internet-based
financial services. The study addressed conducting risk-based assessments and customer awareness program. The study
was conducted on all the twenty (20) currently operating commercial banks in Nigeria.abstractrpTwo-factor authentication, internet banking, authentication factor, strong authentication, web securitykeywordsrpAn authentication factor is a piece of information and
process used to authenticate or verify the identity of a
person or other entity requesting access under security
constraints[1].
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a system where in
two or more different factors are used in conjunction to
authenticate[1]. Using more than one factor is
sometimes called “strong authentication”. The process
that solicits multiple answers to challenge questions as
well as retrieves ‘something you have’ or ‘something
you are’ is considered multifactor[2].
True multifactor authentication requires the use of
solution from two or more of the three categories of
factors. Using multiple solutions from the same
category would not constitute multifactor authentication
[2].
Financial institutions engaging in any form of Internet
banking should have effective and reliable methods to
authenticate customers. An effective authentication system
is necessary for compliance with requirements to protect
customer information, to prevent money laundering and
terrorist financing, to reduce fraud, to inhibit identity theft,
and to promote the legal enforceability of their electronic
agreements and transactions. The risks of doing business
with unauthorized or incorrectly identified persons in an
Internet banking environment can result in financial loss
and reputation damage through fraud, disclosure of
customer information, corruption of data, or unenforceable
agreements.Wikipedia, the online free encyclopaedia defines internet
banking as “Online banking (or Internet banking or Ebanking)
allows customers of a financial institution to
conduct financial transactions on a secure website operated
by the institution, which can be a retail or virtual bank,
credit union or building society”. Also, Hazell and
Raphael[8] described it as “a number of ways in which
customers can access their banks without having to be
physically present at a bank branch.
Authentication schemes according to Sumathi and
Esakkirajan[6] are the mechanisms that determine whether
a user is who he or she claims to be. Authentication can be
carried out at the operating system level or by the RDBMS.
The database administrator creates for every user an
individual account or user name[7]. In addition to these
accounts, users are also assigned passwords.introductionrpFinancial institutions offering Internet-based products
and services should have reliable and secure methods to
authenticate their customers. The level of authentication
used by the financial institution should be appropriate
to the risks associated with those products and services.
Financial institutions should conduct a risk assessment
to identify the types and levels of risk associated with
their Internet banking applications. Where risk
assessments indicate that the use of single-factor
authentication is inadequate, financial institutions
should implement multifactor authentication, layered
security, or other controls reasonably calculated to
mitigate those risks. The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) consider single-factor authentication, as the only
security control mechanism, to be inadequate in the
case of high-risk transactions involving access to
customer information or the movement of funds to
other parties. It was discovered from the study that all
Nigerian banks have adopted and implemented the 2FA
methods as mandated by the CBN and to meet
international standards.
The success of a particular authentication method
depends on more than the technology. It also depends
on appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. An
effective authentication method should have customer
acceptance, reliable performance, scalability to
accommodate growth, and interoperability with existing
systems and future plans.Three methods were used to gather information for the
survey; (1) information from the banks’ websites, (2)
telephones calls to the e-banking units of some of the
banks, and (3) enquiring from the customer service
officers in some bank’s branches where information
could not be gotten from any of the previous two
methods.conclusionrp[1] Central Bank of Nigeria: Guidelines on Electronic

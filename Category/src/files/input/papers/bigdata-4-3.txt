SECURITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH BIG DATA IN
CLOUD COMPUTINGtitlerpIn this paper, we discuss security issues for cloud computing, Big data, Map Reduce and Hadoop
environment. The main focus is on security issues in cloud computing that are associated with big
data. Big data applications are a great benefit to organizations, business, companies and many
large scale and small scale industries.We also discuss various possible solutions for the issues
in cloud computing security and Hadoop. Cloud computing security is developing at a rapid pace
which includes computer security, network security, information security, and data privacy.
Cloud computing plays a very vital role in protecting data, applications and the related
infrastructure with the help of policies, technologies, controls, and big data tools. Moreover,
cloud computing, big data and its applications, advantages are likely to represent the most
promising new frontiers in science.abstractrpCloud Computing, Big Data, Hadoop,Map Reduce, HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)keywordsrpIn order to analyze complex data and to identify patterns it is very important to securely store,
manage and share large amounts of complex data.Cloud comes with an explicit security
challenge, i.e. the data owner might not have any control of where the data is placed. The reason
behind this control issue is that if one wants to get the benefits of cloud computing, he/she must
also utilize the allocation of resources and also the scheduling given by the controls. Hence it is
required to protect the data in the midst of untrustworthy processes. Since cloud involves
extensive complexity, we believe that rather than providing a holistic solution to securing the
cloud, it would be ideal to make noteworthy enhancements in securing the cloud that will
ultimately provide us with a secure cloud.
Google has introduced MapReduce [1] framework for processing large amounts of data on
commodity hardware. Apache’s Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is evolving as a superior
software component for cloud computing combined along with integrated parts such as
MapReduce. Hadoop, which is an open-source implementation of Google MapReduce, including
a distributed file system, provides to the application programmer the abstraction of the map and
the reduce. With Hadoop it is easier for organizations to get a grip on the large volumes of data
being generated each day, but at the same time can also create problems related to security, data
access, monitoring, high availability and business continuity.In this paper, we come up with some approaches in providing security. We ought a system that
can scale to handle a large number of sites and also be able to process large and massive amounts
of data. However, state of the art systems utilizing HDFS and MapReduce are not quite
enough/sufficient because of the fact that they do not provide required security measures to
protect sensitive data. Moreover, Hadoop framework is used to solve problems and manage data
conveniently by using different techniques such as combining the k-means with data mining
technology [3].introductionrpCloud environment is widely used in industry and research aspects; therefore security is an
important aspect for organizations running on these cloud environments. Using proposed
approaches, cloud environments can be secured for complex business operations.conclusionrp[1] Ren, Yulong, and Wen Tang. "A SERVICE INTEGRITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK FOR CLOUD

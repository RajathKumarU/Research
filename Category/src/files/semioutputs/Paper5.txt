Identifying Customer Interest in Real Estate Using
Data Mining TechniquestitlerpReal estate industry has become a highly
competitive business with an enormous amount of
unstructured documents and resources. The process of data
mining in such a business provides an advantage to the
developers by processing those data, predicting future trends
and helping them to make favorable knowledge-driven
decisions. In this paper, we focus on data mining techniques
and its applications to develop a model which not only
predicts the most suitable area for a customer based on his
interest, but also identifies the most preferred and ideal
location of real estate in any given area by ranking them.abstractrpdata mining, infogainattributeeval, linear

working productively to gain a competitive edge over other
competitors. To achieve this, a reliable and a fast growing
technology such as data mining is extensively used. With
an enormous amount of data available in huge databases
and data warehouses, it is important to develop a powerful
model for analysis and extraction of such data and mining
them for interesting knowledge [1].
Various data mining tools available in today’s market helps
organizations to make important and useful knowledge
driven decisions. Hence, in this paper, we use data mining
techniques in two different phases, where the first one deals
with ranking of areas in each of the 5 zones of Delhi and
identify an ideal location for real estate customers using the
InfoGainAttributeEval function of WEKA tool [2]. The
second phase is about predicting the most suitable area for
any given customer based on his/her interest. We predict
using a classical technique called linear regression and try
to give an analysis of the results obtained.introductionrpIn today’s highly competitive real estate business, it has
become difficult to store such huge data and extract them
for one’s own requirement. Also, the extracted should be
useful which is another complicated step, otherwise, there
would be no use of using such data. Implementing the
concepts of data mining applications in such a field has
definitely proven to be useful, time saving and
advantageous to both, the customers and the real estate
dealers. Divided in two phases, we have applied data
mining techniques such as linear regression for predicting a
suitable area to the customer and identifying the most
preferred residential area in Delhi. The same methods can
be applied in finding the ideal location in rest of the zones
of Delhi or in any given city.conclusionrp[1] Lu Ansheng, “Application Analysis of Clementine-based Data

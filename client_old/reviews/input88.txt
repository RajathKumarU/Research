I have been using this phone from 5th May 2015 i.e Approx 3 months.Initially when i purchased this phone it had heating problem, phone used to heat up quickly but after 1 week or so after purchasing phone the update of 900MB came i updated my phone and Trust me it resolved all the heating problems now i have installed games of 1 gb and 1.5 gb still phone works very properly. So If planning to buy this phone? It is really worth.It has a good display nice build nice camera and MIUI is also nice and There is no lag while playing games and the nice thing is that it charges very quickly. Overall I am happy with this phone at this price tag!!  AND IF YOU ARE FACING HEATING PROBLEM IN YOUR PHONE JUST UPDATE YOUR PHONE IT WILL SURELY RESOLVE YOUR PROBLEM!! :)

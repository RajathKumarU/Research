This is my 4th day with this new phone .Look wise no doubt best phone in recent market. feature wise also great .Mi really done fabulous job giving all best things in this budget.heating issue is also drastically vanished ,i would say not like earlier Mi phones.you will immediate updates from MI after you switch on the phone.  Pros - 1.Looks wise very nice ,size is also very handy and portable 2.display is awesome 3.camera superb 4.battery is best ,it is giving almost 24 hrs even more than that if u r average user .i have not tested with high end gaming 5.light weight  cons-no external SD card slot ( for me it is ok bcz you will have 12.5 GB to use ,i think this is enough for me ,you can also use external OTG for viewing movies or listening songs ) 2.no screen guard with the box.

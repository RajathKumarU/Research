After 2 months of usage I personally feel that mobile is great in terms of features in this price range. But lacks in battery & software(Heating & charging issues occur often)  Pros: 1) Display 441 PPI is just awesome. Playing games and watching movies is superb. 2) Both primary & secondary Camera are fantastic. Focus & others features are quite decent. 3) Design of the mobile is good. Less weight. It's easy to remove stains on mobile. 4) Root access is great. Can remove unwanted default installed softwares.  Cons: 1) Doesn't have expandable storage 2) Often I face heating issues 3) Battery 3120 mAh is for name sake. Battery drains too faster. 4) Software (MiUi) feels good but doesn't works properly at times. E.g: While charging the mobile at particular stage the charging stops. Say, charges from 10% to 64% thereafter I couldn't find any indication of charging. I need to restart the mobile to continue the charging process. 5) Sound quality is very worst and most of the headphones are not supported by Mi mobiles

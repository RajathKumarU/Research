I bought this phone on first flash sale held on 30-04-2015. On screen every thing looked absolutely amazing and when i ordered on this day(30-04-2015) the expected delivery date was 8th of May but i got it on 3rd of May AWESOME.  What i liked about this phone: 1.) Screen size and display quality.====== 9/10. 2.) Processor octacore 1.7/1.1 ghz. ======7/10. 3.) Battery 3120 mah. ================8/10. 4.) Quick Charge tech. ===============8/10. 5.) Sunlight Display.=================9/10. 6.) Camera========================9/10.  Updated the marks of camera to "9" i feel this performs way better.  But still i think at the price of 12999/-, MI4I should be shipped with atleast a standard handsfree.

> Camera - The front camera is too good, the exposure option is very effective. Rear camera does a decent job too with the double flash. > Features - accommodates most of the high end phone features, what more can we ask for in 12,999!!! > Performance - NO LAGS absolutely.. smooth interface easily enhances the performance of the phone, a good multi-tasker > Display - 1080 dpi HD!!! Do i need to say anything more, the Sunlight feature works just fine. > Battery - decent battery back-up. A full charge runs 16-18 hours with moderate usage. Camera, Video play and WiFi sucks up the battery at some pace though. Also it take around 2.5-3 hours to full charge > Storage - 16 GB internal and around 11 GB user memory is more than enough for a someone who doesn't game. However no External memory is a con but it connects OTG pendrive which compensates for the con. > Heating - Yes after a continuous usage of camera, wifi, charging and gaming the phone heats up in about an hours time, but the good thing is it cools down within 10 mins of stand-by > Speakers - slightly disappointed with it, the external speakers are not loud.  Overall good for the budget it comes in. Pretty happy with it so far!

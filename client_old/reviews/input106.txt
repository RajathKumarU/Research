I must say this is one of those product, where a person is on a crossroad seeing Performance, Quality and Monetary satisfaction together. But before i move towards pros and cons of Mi 4i, i have being reading a lot about the heating issues from my other fellow users. The simple step to AVOID OVER-HEATING is to UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM to latest version. That's it. To do this, click settings < about phone < system updates. (make sure your are connected to a decent internet connection because you will be required to download a 806mb update)  Before updating, the phone used to get heated within minutes of normal usage but now its running smoothly without giving me a tan. After updating i have been using this phone for 2 hours on a stretch, that too with wifi on, and I didn't find any over-heating issues. So before you start doing experiments with Mi 4i camera and other stuffs, make sure you have updated your Mi 4i system first. But still, a little Heads-Up from Xiaomi would have been better in this regard. Now the,  Pros: 1)Excellent Display screen (finally i can see in bright sunlight what on earth am i clicking) 2)Strong Wifi receiver when you compare it with other phones (even the high end ones) 3)No useless bloatwares 4)Yes outer body is made of plastic but its nowhere near to being labeled as cheap. In-fact its very good, look-wise and the feel. 5)The best part are its touch and user interface. Smooth and lag free.  Cons: 1)Average speaker 2)Power and Volume Button could have been more sturdy 3)Heating issues prior to System update(Yes, this nuisance went away after update) 4)Only 10.83 GB available to users out of 16 GB(Considering there is no slot for SD card)  Everything has two sides to it and overall am very satisfied with this product.

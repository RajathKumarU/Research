I have ordered 2 pcs of Mi 4i. I am using Samsung S3 and S5 at present. The phone feels good in hand and is easy to hold. Screen resolution is nice. I found the interface of the phone a bit dull. Fonts are small and the notification panel icons are highlighted very less when turned on, making it hard to distuinguish whether the feature is turned on or off.  The good: i) Light weight ii) Nice screen iii) Lots of option for customization iv) Useful pre-installed apps. v) Nice battery backup vi) Price vii) Very good front camera for selfie (Much better than my S5)  and the Bad  i) Back is dust magnet ii) Front glass although claimed to be scratch resistant but easilt gets scratches. iii) Although speaker sound doesn't distort but the volume level is mediocre (still better than S5) iv) Back camera is not that good. Color are under saturated,low light pictures are noisy and dull. v) No expendable memory is a headache (Less than 12 available storage).  Hope these points help to decide whether to go with the phone or not.

A very good crafted super slim phone. I'm using it for more than 24 hours. It has a big heating issue. Phone heats up like hell during 3g use around camera and ear speaker region. You cannot even call for 5 mins over voip.  Pros: Premium look in 13k. good camera quality both rear and front. UI is good but consumes around over 1 gb ram. No lag till now.(I'm not a gamer. :P) Cons: Heating issue. Even on normal use phone gets warm.Tough to handle long calls like on whatsapp. I observed it takes considerable amount of time to charge through laptop.(but OK) Overall phone is very good except heating issues. Snapdragon 615 had this issue in past too. Hope Xiaomi will launch some patches to get over it. :)

I bought the MI4i after going through all reviews online. Previously I had a Micromax and a Xolo with me. so a Xiomi is sort of an upgrade for me. :-) Coming to the phone. I got the phone delivered on May 26 2015. Delivery from Filpkart was flawless. It came before time and I had no issues with the overall delivery. Now for the features and my own personal experience. 1) First thing that strikes you about the phone as to how light weight it is. It is very easy to carry. 2) Camera of the phone is brilliant. Both front and back, especially the back is too good. 3) The OS and overall handling i.e the touch is very smooth and till now I am not having any issues.  Coming to the main part i.e. the battery and the heating issues which concerns phone users these days. The battery will last 1 full day with normal usage. Best thing is the phone charges itself in little over an hour(75 mins) from 0 to 100% charging. Coming to the heating issues.Phone will heat up if you play a lot of games and use heavy duty apps but since I personally don't play that much and use the phone for things Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and stuff, in my own personal experience till now ( 3 weeks), the phone has not heated up that much like my other phones have.  So overall till now, a pleasant experience for me :)

I bought this phone for Rs.10000 only. Very sleek body. Mi4i has very great display. Lightweight phone. But its not premium phone but for 10 to 13k bucks you can get one. But for this price range its the best buy. Battery is good.  Cons: But this mobile has heating problem when play cpu intensive games like FIFA. But it doesn't heat on games like Asphalt 8. Camera is of average quality of pics taken it night.  In my opinion this phone it the best buy for this price range. Heating problem is not that grave. So if you thinking of buying this mobile and you are gamer then this is the best phone you could buy :)

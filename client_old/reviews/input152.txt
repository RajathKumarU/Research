I have used the phone for a day now. There is undoubtedly a heating issue in the device, but not as much people are saying. It does get a bit warm after an heavy usage. I would request Hugo Barra and his staff to give an update to fix the heating issue.  Other than the heating issue, I did not feel any kind of problem in this phone.  Display- Display is really good. As said by Xiaomi the ppi of this device is greater than that of Iphone 6. Build Quality- Decent for a 13k phone. Performance - No as such heavy lag is experienced by me till now. Camera - Nice, but would have improved. Storage - People who are okay with 11 Gigabytes of storage : This is the best phone. Other wise one can anyday access more files with an OTG cable.  Till now, I am not coming across any decent back covers. I would request to launch some funky covers and cases for Mi 4i.  Overall, I would rate this phone a 4 out of 5.  PS: I am not a new Xiaomi user. I have used a Redmi Note 4G before.

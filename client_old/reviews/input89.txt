using since 2 months.. now in MIUI 6.6.6.0, battery backup is good, i should say a day time heavy usage at full charge at morning leaves me at almost 30% at evening when i get back at home. My Usage:- Calls - 2g/3g(auto) - almost 20 calls totalling to maybe 1.5Hrs - Internet calls - 2 Hrs min Data - Wifi and Mobile Data is On 24/7. it switches and connects automatically when i reach home. Games - not playing games heavily in mobile. max 10 - 15 minutes. Display - at auto brightness ( with double tap to wake ON).  I will recommend and has already made two of my friends get Mi4i at 10% off offer just like me.  I am looking forward to life expire my mi4i for my next adventure with the latest mi phone of that time.. maybe mi7.. :) :) :)

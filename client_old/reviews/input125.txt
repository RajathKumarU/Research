I am using mi4i since 24th May. I have one more in 14th July. I have already use many android phone, such as Samsung Galaxy Note 3, HTC 816g, Xperia C3, etc... but believe me or not, this is a great mobile than all the mobile which i have used earlier. I am not explaining the specification which already explained many. But I would like to share some good and bads about this phone. Good:- 1. Design... It is unibody design that lends it a very solid look and feel.It's build from high quality polycarbonate which gives very premium looks like iphone 5s. 2. Display... this is something great which is not available in most high end phone. 3. Camera... Fabulous. I checked with Xperia Z3 & Galaxy A7 at Chroma Showroom, I can say the xiaomi mi4i camera is something great. 4. Perfomance...as a normal user I am very satisfied the way it is performing. 5. Battery... for me it is lasting 36 to 40 hours with normal use. Bad:- 1. No Headset... Xiaomi should have prove this. All the ear phone will not work with mi4i. 2. Heating... It is major problem in all xiaomi phones and the story is still continuing. Even i have done the new OTA update, still the heat is there. 3. Limited Storage... out of 16gb internal storage, 10.68gb of which is available for applications and user date when you boot up the phone for the first time.. which is good enough for me..but not everyone. Xiaomi is offering USB OTG support for this phone.  Overall it is nice deal and you can easily beat the high end phones around 20,000/- price tags.

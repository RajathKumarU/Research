I had a Moto G gen 1 previously. Bought this when I saw the flash sale. After getting used to stock android Lollipop getting acclimatized with MIUI is difficult. Phone gets heated up very quickly especially when you click pictures. The inbuilt apps are taking up too much of RAM. Only 10.89 GB available for use which is a downer compared to 12.9 odd of Moto G. Other than that the phone is pretty fast, compact, bright and weightless. Will get to know better after using it for sometime.

nitially i had multiple issues with the new Mi4i phone like SIM card not deducted, Reboot not working, Power off taking more than 15 minutes, Invalid IEMI code and Can't get device id. But finally i found the solution for all the issues(after 4 attempt of factory reset). Once I upgraded to 6.7.2, all problem was solved and it is perfect now. I learned lot of things about Android and MIUI stuffs. But not everyone would be like me:-). Thanks to MIUI forum and flipkart customer support.

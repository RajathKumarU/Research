At first reviews got me scared but still I purchased it and when I got this phone my first attempt was the latest update and then there is NO HEATING ISSUE. however the chipset is designed in such a way that it gets heat up but only after much use of this phone. I mean the regular use. There's nothing to worry, every smart phone get heated up even the big budget phone like S6 edge gets heated up. People on flipkart are throwing bullshit there's noting like it I say Spolier Alert - No Heat after the update. I am reviewing this product because of the non-sense that people are talking about.

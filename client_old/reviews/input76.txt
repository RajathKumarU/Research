Thanks to both Xiaomi & Flipkart for this amazing phone! Firstly, I got it at almost half the original price (after Diwali discount, old mobile exchange and credit card discount). Thanks to Flipkart for offering such opportunity. Secondly, the MIUI Ver.7 (got updated from 6 to 7 after switching it on) is simply outstanding. I am using it for just over a week and I am satisfied with its performance. Occasionally, I sensed a bit of heat generation, especially after prolong use, which is perhaps true with every mobile handset, but otherwise it is the best bargain among the other mobiles available in the market. Camera is super, selfies are lively. Sound quality is good which I suggest to improve a bit louder, so that it becomes audible when in public. Dual SIM facility is working perfectly. WhatsApp, e-mail, facebook all are running without glitches. What more we want?

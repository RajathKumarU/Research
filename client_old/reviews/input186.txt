This is my first review for any phone. I have brought this phone one and half month ago now I want to share my opinion for this phone so that people can get help. I can give 3 star out of 5. We can’t say it is amazing phone. Its good a phone. Cons: the heating issue is still there. We didn't receive earphone with this phone. Ear phone choose feature available in this phone but sometime earphone not supporting after selection. Difficulty to select your ringtones. Sometimes game is getting slow because of low memory even though 2GB RAM available. Pros: Nice look. Sound quality is good. Front camera is awesome however back is not that much. Battery backup is fine one day deal not more than that after normal use. Never hang till now.

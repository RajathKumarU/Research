Firstly, I would like to thank Flipkart for their quick delivery on the product. Guys, please note that this is my honest review of using this phone for around 2 months.  Pros- Brilliant 1080p Screen with Vibrant Colors Good Camera. Honestly, I did not expect it to be good considering it was made in China! Lol Good Battery. A 3000 MaH battery in a 5 inch phone is nothing to complain about! Overall Build quality is good Performance is decent considering the price. 4G / LTE. Finally!1 Its always better to have a phone with LTE Bands.  Now oming to the Cons/Negatives The UI is not stable. Crashes a lot of times even on simple things like while receiving a call Comes up with Error ' Unfortunately, Call function has stopped. Same applies to Gallery and Camera  The Phone heats up quite easily even while doing simple tasks like using Camera.  This Phone becomes a tAWA aka Like a Hot frying Pan while playing any Game. Trust me this is so annoying.  Heats up while using 4g/LTE Too. Specially when you enable Data or Voice Calling.  I am really unsure of any Security/ OS Updates on this phone as this is a Custom UI (MiUi)  Loudspeaker quality is bad. But thanks to some tweaks and updates this is getting better.  No expandable Storage. This is the Biggest Con of all.  Overall Verdict. You cannot ask for anything more from this phone when your getting it for this cheap with decent features. Yes, I understand everyone needs quality stuff, Trust me I have used a HTC One (M7) and the Build was awesome but camera sucks!! Every Phone has its Pros and Cons. But I feel this one has a Balance between Price and Performance and features good enough for Daily use.

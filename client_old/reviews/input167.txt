The Phone quality and Camera is best to compare with moto G series, and cloud sync service saved my photos from accidental delete, As average users i recommend this phone is outstanding phone in budget but with MiUi i found the Pure Android experience is still missing for example Google Now the reminder and voice assistance function is not work proper as expected from android however there is no alternative available for MiUi and i have my moto 360 found compatible issues to sync notifications and voice control with this device, but u want to control applications and behaviour i recommended this Mi4I as the mobile encharge security functionality with MiUi as no other android base OS gives you. and Voice quality, Battery life, camera clearity over all gives 4 star only compatibility with pure android function 1 start is missing.

I'm writing this after a day of usage. Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days.  This phone is the BEST in terms of style, performance, battery and camera. Display of this phone, OMG, it's beyond any words. AWESOME !  Absolutely light and can't feel that you are carrying it, at first place. Nice design, made for human hands.  The device heats up a bit, but there are no phones in market that doesn't heat up and also I heard the heating issue is resolved in the immediate OTA update which pops up as soon as you switch on for the first time (~800 MB), which I haven't done so far.  MIUI is so fluidic in every nature. This is my first Mi / Xiaomi device and it's way beyond expectations atleast after a day of usage.  Pros: Awesome display Fluidic MIUI Excellent Camera (both front / back) No lag Superb call quality Cost effective Great battery  Cons: Average volume (Not too loud)  **************************************************************************************************** It's steal at this price band. Awesome phone, you can go for it !! ****************************************************************************************************

I bought this phone on first flash sale, used this for a week.  I like all their advertised features, selected this phone after reading so much reviews about multiple phones in the same price band.  It works good except heating problem. I played Candy Crush for about 20 mins and the phone got heated up, so couldn't decided whether to continue using the phone after that. It happened on when performance core got activated. In normal mode, it works better.

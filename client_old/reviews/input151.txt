I purchased this phone as a gift for my father. Though I received it on 2nd May, we gifted it only today because of the occasion.  Setup: Setup took longer than expected. I thought there was some confusion with Google account setup when it repeated the step again once done. That said, everything else was fine.  Heat: Phone got warmer during normal usage at the top. But I guess that's with almost every smartphone nowadays. I didn't feel it much later on, may be because it subsided or I got used to it :)  Primary Camera: Didn't not play around much. From what I have seen, pic quality is quite decent but even a slight unsteady hand can make your pics blurred.  Performance: Seemed fine, though I could notice a lag while trying to change screens/apps swiftly.  Overall, it seemed like a decent buy for its price. But, need to see how it fares in the long run.

After doing research on the latest phones , I bought this phone.  Review of mi 4i after upgrading to 6.5.5 MIUI stable version  PROS: Build is perfect for usage as well to place in pocket Amazing Screen Good battery life High speed network connectivity in performance mode(better than iphone6 in my test) HDR Photos are very good at its price range Got it for Rs,11,700 in Flipkart during offer days with 24-hour delivery One hand usage is good.  CONS: Slight warm on continuous use of 20 min or more Volume and Power buttons are sharp at the corners(doesn't feel premium) Plastic body feels delicate, especially if you have kids Micro USB connector is not comfortable while plugging in or removing the pin(very tight) Limited memory Loud Speaker is not great; OK sound 1 GB is used by MIUI and if you open a couple of apps, the remaining RAM shows 700MB(RAM is not being used optimally)  Some Observations in my usage  Ran Antutu BenchMark Tests after OS upgrade: balanced mode 31k performance mode 39k  Used the phone extensively in balanced mode Full battery got charged in less than 3 hrs with the 2A charger given along with the phone When using the camera/browsing/gaming for 30 min makes the phone warm (Not heating); Same thing observed in my htc also; felt not a problem  Basic camera settings doesn't give very good photos; need to do small changes for good photos  FaceBook app hanged once in my use.  Network speed is amazingly fast (compared to my htc one X and iphone6)  Screen looks little dull at 50% brightness compared to other phones at same brightness level  Ran few games like temple run without any issues  Loud speaker sound is on the lower side  Receiver sound during calls also is not on the higher side; It is Ok  1 GB RAM is always used by MIUI; only 900MB to 1 GB left for the user. If you open large number of apps, may be a problem; Tried with 7 to 8 apps, no issues.  Ran Asphalt8 for 10 min in balanced mode; didn't face any UI lags; but the device became warm beside the camera, checked the temp - it is around 40 (same thing on my htc was 40, but because of the material and build, i dont feel it much on my htc) may be because of the chipset density and octa core in mi 4i,so i am feeling 40 also as light heat on the outside.

Just got mi 4i. initially at strting steps it started to heat up, and believe me you wont like to hold your phone. then during operations it lagged sometime, during charging it was heating, durin calls it was heating. its like a heating machine. Pros : premium look. really awesome display, similar to iphone displays. touch very simple and smooth. performance is good enough but heats a lot. cons : heating and only heating. low speaker sound cant hear from beyond 7-10 meter.  if you want only good screen buy it. if you dont want to hurt youself during light phone use then dont buy it. it heats a lot and i mean it.i was unable to operate. no and headphones.

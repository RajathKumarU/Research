After 3 weeks usage I face few problems 1. RAM is occupying 1.2 GB all the time out of 2 GB 2. Heating issue MI might fix this issue in coming releases. 3. Big Issue: Speakers sound is very low, before release of this mobile I thought sound would rocks but it is failed under this section 4. Size of the software (Loliipop) is more, should be reduced 5. Other than MI launchers phone is freezing and lag 6. Camera is not that much clear in low lights.

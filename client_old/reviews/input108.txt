Got this on first flash sale.Will come directly to the point as specs are clearly mentioned.  1.No Heating issue : Please update the software , around 800Mb, and it should be fine , had updated as soon as I got phone.I did not experience any heating issu not sure why many people have commented that.  2.Phone easily runs for 1 day (Full day 3g + around 6hrs of WIFI + 3hrs of Future Fight game + 3-4 hrs of browsing(screen time))  3.There is some lag in UI, and after having the screen guard on (unofficial), it becomes unresponsive. Waiting for the original Screen Guard , will update once I get that.  4.Call Quality,looks and the sound output when connected to headphones are awesome. Phone speaker is not that great actually below average.  Overall very good phone at this range. Cannot expect more at 12,999k.  If you are planning to buy phone for less than 20k this one has no competition.

The best that i liked the most about Mi 4i: 1. Its slim look : very easy to handle & use. 2. Amazing 13MP camera: I liked auto focusing feature the most. 3. Battery Backup: Can stay more than 24HRS as per average usage (2g net for 7-8HRS) 4. Remaining 2GB ram all bla bla bla things are advantage.  Disadvatanges: 1. Heating issues but it can be tolerated as it happens with every android phones. 2. NO headset, NO screen guard , NO Back cover-->(Xiomi Saved a lot on accessories) Yaar If you are selling a Underwear why don't you sell a Trousers. I have to search in market for back cover/ Flip cover n still i am not getting it.  Mr Flipkart.com pls be noted when you launch a new phone kindly arrange accessories like cover/screen-guard & all which are not readily available in market.  Dear All Don't hesitate you can go for this phone its awesome.

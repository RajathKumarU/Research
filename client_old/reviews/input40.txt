I searched lot of mobile phones before buying it and would like to say that it is really a awesome awesome mobile phone produced by Xiaomi. I bought this mobile on 30th of April and it got delivered to me on 4th of May via standard ekart delivery.  The moment I opened the box I observed a wow factor. I am using this mobile from last 3 days very rigorously with both the SIM's active and 3G on all the time on second SIM and getting a very decent battery life around more than one day easily (although I am not a heavy gamer but using rest all the features like fb,chat, emails, web browsing, camera shots, wifi, Bluetooth etc.)  As far as the mobile display is concerned I haven't seen any display as good as this one even in a 20K price range. Phone slightly heats up during heavy use but it is not something which is not manageable.  Phone feels very premium in hand and very easy to operate with only one hand. MIUI 6 is having many useful features and customization which you will not find in any stock Android. I was using Samsung S4 before it and trust me this phone is lot better than that even it is half of it's price.  Guys if you are looking for some mobile in 15-20K price range then go for this one instead and trust me you will not regret..

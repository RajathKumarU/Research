Overheating?: I was initially concerned about the reports of overheating from reviews on FK as well as from some reviewers. After using the phone for a few days I have not experienced any overheating. Like all phones, it gets a bit warm if you use it while charging and also for highly intensive games. But even during gaming, it never got too hot, just slightly warm. This is on Asphalt 8, Subway Surfers and Clash of Clans.  Design: The device feels extremely great in your hand, even better than the Mi 3 and much nicer than the bigger phablets like Zenfone 2 and Honor 4x. The matte finish make the device feel premium. Every person I have shown my phone to has first commented on how light it feels, but also remarked how solid it is.  Battery: The battery has been great, easily lasts me a day with some room to spare.  Display: This is the main reason why I decided to buy the Mi 4i. The display is unparalleled in this price range and even in 20k+ devices. 1080p display just looks beautiful. The Corning OGS glass is same as GG 3 and makes me feel safe with my purchase. Also, I thought Sunlight Display was just a marketing gimmick, but it actually makes it easier to use my phone outdoors.  Performance: Really love the performance of this phone. There are some minor lags after playing games for 30min+. Once the device cools down again it works as normal.  Overall: Best phone since Mi 3. Don't believe the overheating reports until you actually use the phone. I was worried after watching a YouTube video showing really bad overheating, but he switched on performance mode. I have not seen any overheating in default mode and am still able to play all the games I want.

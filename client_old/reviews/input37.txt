I received phone on 6th May ..first of all i Charged it to 100% then i installed OTA update 6.5.3.0 which i Pre-downloaded on my PC & Clear Cache in Mi recovery . then i installed all Apps & check All Apps working. i have no Problem No Heating , No Lagging , only one Minus Point Speaker Sound is bit low ...but for me its enough. Pros. 1. 5-inch smartphone ,compact, slim, lightweight 2. extra bright display, the slim OGS glass panel and the Sunlight Display 3. Performance: Fast but not optimal 4. Camera: Impressive! high quality sensors, fast response excellent HDR Cons. 1 . storage issue only 16 GB 2. Low Sound output I recommend it to Buy everyone , i dont recommend it for Power Users

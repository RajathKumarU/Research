I used Mi3 for more than one year. Recently I bought Mi4i during Billion day offer.  Pros: Convenient to handle Smooth edges Good looking and Great Design 4G compatible Dual SIM Less weight Camera quality is superb when compared with Mi3  As of now I haven't faced any Heating issue. Need to check after upgrading to MIUI 7.  Cons: I feel Mi3's performance is better than this model We need to cut the normal sim card Sound quality is not that much when compared with Mi3 2G connection performance is very poor. Not sure whether this problem is with this mobile or service provider.  In overall I am satisfied with this mobile for the price which I purchased.

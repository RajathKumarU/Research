Reviews based on 3 days of usage:  - First thing you will notice is very light in weight - Display is super - Butter smooth touch - MIUI6 has lot of features. - Got update on the very first day though a big one of 800MB. - Battery is great. - Even 5 inch screen is so easy to handle.  Phone do get heated up if used extensively but not very much that we can't use. Ram availability is also little bit less that is 1GB approx.  Overall till now, satisfied with the Phone as per my requirements.

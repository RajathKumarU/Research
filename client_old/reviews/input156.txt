After using it for Three days: Phone is slim , body is nice ,picture quality is good. Ph is light, It gives a feeling of having a 13k ph in hand. over all this package is good except few points as below:  1)Storage: After three days i have only 1 gb left so there must be SD card slot. 2)Power button is not so good, it looks like if i will press it , it gonna be damage. feels artificial. 3)Back camera hardware fitment is not good , it must be placed properly. 4)Calling sensor is not so quite good, some time response some time too late. 5)Battery drained so fast, i use ph only for calling in day and i use whatsapp in night and other stuff on ipad, battery is not so good, hardly survive for 12 hours. 6) double tap waking sensor is also not up to mark need improvement. It response to late.  over all anyone can buy this ph is having value for money. " ITNE ME KYA AB BACHE KI JAAN LOGE"

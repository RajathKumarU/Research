I have been using this product for 2 days and its the review based of the 2 days of usage  1.Its heats up like anything even for normal Browser usage  2.battery backup is about 1 day 4 hours with Single Sim (2G) and wifi on continuously on single charge,with minimal usage i.e 1 hour youtube,minimal calls and other Social Networking etc.  3.The call clarity is awesome, the sound is clear and crisp,but after making calls for 22 minutes continuously,I felt unusual heating near the earphone thats very irritating.  4.There is bit of Lag in the UI,can't be sensed so easily ( I felt lag while toggling from one app to other) hope Mi would come with an OTA for this  5.At the first Boot I got a Ram of 1Gb from 2GB,but during usage after killing all apps u get something close to 800 mb ram.  6.At the first Boot the internal Storage of the phone was close to 10.6 Gb after removing unnecessary preinstalled apps the memory came up to 11.45 GB (with NO other apps loaded) since there is no Option for memory card you have to keep a Pendrive with you and transfer your clicked photos via OTG.  7.the camera is descent takes good photograph,but there is lot of noise in low light conditions,which will literally spoil the pics,so this phone doesn't perform well in Low light  8.Gaming was just Ok with too much heating,there is something strange in Mi 4i that even the Screen heats up dangerously.  9.The tall claim of Xiaomi as flagship device for India is'nt apparent after using the Phone  verdict: If heating and short memory storage is'nt an issue the phone is the best.hope xiaomi will come with an OTA in order to curb the heating issue.

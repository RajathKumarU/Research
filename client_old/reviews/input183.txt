Writing this review after 3 Months usage. The first thing to say is the hopeless aftersales service of MI. My Charger became faulty within one month. After 45 days my front camera started giving problems. The camera gives grainy pictures. Tried calling their support. They told some cache wiping . But nothing worked out. They told to take to service center. I am living in Calicut Keral. My nearest Service Center is Ernakulam abt 200 KMS away. Also there are 3 Service centers in Kerala. But none of them are reachable. So unless you have a MI service center near you never ever buy this product. When I searched MI forums a lot of other customers are facing front camera issues. But MI has never taken any steps to resolve it.  Speaking abt the product  PROS 1. Display is good. 2. Battery is good. 3. Decent Cameras 4. Interface is fine 5. I am not heavy gamer.. So cant comment abt heating  CONS 1. Low Speaker / Ring volume 2. No headphones, Case, along with the phone 3. Speaker placed in back side doesn't give good volume 4. Hopeless support

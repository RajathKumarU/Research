This will be my second best phone after Mi 3. Mi 3 was amazing, great smooth experience. Mi 4i still is one of the best phone under 15k mark at the moment. Does heat a bit during gaming and charging but Mi 3 did too but less than this. BTW all high end phones does get warm in similar circumstances and hot Indian weather. 16 GB is the only con with this phone but works for me, not much into mobile gaming and mobile videos you see, sufficient enough for me. Camera is just pure awesome, better than the Mi 3. Processing good but falls short of Mi 3. Dual 4G stand by is God send for me.  Hope Xiaomi provides 32 GB version soon and please provide the cases which were shown in the Mi 4i keynote speech by Hugo.  Thanks a lot to Xiaomi and Flipkart.

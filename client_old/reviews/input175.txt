This device should've been a master piece but it missed this opportunity in terms of comfort It heats too much that's the problem with this device.  The buiild quality is awesome feels premium the moment you touch it. Screen is full HD. Vivid and bright. Very ligjt. Battery back up is awesome. For me it last for 18 hrs at least. Miui 6 is OK. But lags on balanced mode. Needs update. Camera is descent in day light. During night you would not want to use this camera Front camera is awesome with beautify mode. Processor clocks 1.1 GHz fof normal use and 1.65 GHz for heavy apps. Games won't lag for first 10 mins after it starts heating and then lag starts. Browsing is good experience due to full hd screen. Corning ogs protection works didn't found any scratches yet. Sound is ok. Call clarity is good. Network reception is good. Touch is very good. Headphone output is awesome enhanced by MI sound enhancer.  Heat. It heats too much you can't even play games. I hope they release some update that should resolve this issue.

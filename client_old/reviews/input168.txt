The phone is unbelievably slim and light, and feels very classy. The features it packs are not only excellent, but unbelievable for this price. It is almost like an iphone in its operations, and is at the same time, somewhat MORE user-friendly. A great buy. Internal memory is quite good, battery life is fabulous, and it does not take ages to recharge.  Cons: 1. While the camera has very good resolution, image quality is inferior to a similar resolution camera on an iphone. 2. The sleek design makes the phone slippery. If it falls down and the screen is broken, you are in a soup (IT HAPPENED TO ME). The glass and the LCD screen are coupled, so a crack on the glass made my LCD screen inoperative. It had to be replaced (It cost me Rs 4500, while the phone itself was 12999) by the authorized service provider, but it took over three weeks for them to get a replacement screen. Mi accessories are hard to get. 3. The manual is badly written or not available in English.  My advice is: You must buy a screen guard with this phone, which is otherwise, an excellent product of chinese craftsmanship at this cost. The quality is really good, despite the above-mentioned problems.

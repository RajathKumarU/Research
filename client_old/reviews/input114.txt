This is one decent mobile you can get for a given price range. Very light in weight, works fast but I noticed that it gets hot after using it for some time. I wanted a phone with a screen size of not more than 5" and which packs a punch. Thanks Xiaomi for offering a phone at such a competitive price.  Pros: The design is slick and neat. Front camera is not that great. Light in weight. Good price for the specification.  Cons: Gets heated up after using it for some time.( Hope it will be sorted in next update) No memory card slot.  Will update the review for performance post I use it for few more days.

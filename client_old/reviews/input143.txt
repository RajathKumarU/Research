The Phone is good in design with features like 2 gb ram, Octa core processor, dual sim etc. I read several reviews before buying....some positive, some negative. But I wud say I dont regret my purchase. Good and esay to use. Stunning design will aww other people to ask you about the phone. Even people have written about heating problem. I hv not figured out much heating problem, but still phone heats up sometimes. But its not much a big deal.  PROS: Handy 5" screen. Easy to use Interface. Awesome Camera Quality. Dual sim Functionality. CONS: No memory card slot, Batt Slightly lower than Xiaomi Note 4 G.

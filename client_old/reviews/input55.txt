Brilliant phone at this price.  Pros: 1.Display: Best Display any device can provide under 20k. Colors are very natural and specially in sunlight(Sunlight display is incomparable to any device).  2.Camera: Both Rear and Front Camera take brilliant shots. Colors are very natural and very less noisy even in low-light. Dark room flash shots are above expectation. The Dual-tone flash just works perfect. Video: Video recording is also up to the mark.  3.Design & Built: The best design for a 5 inch phone. Very decent and comfortable to hold. Doesn't slips from hand at all and gives a premium look.  4.Gaming: Very good high end gaming experience.  5. Call Quality: Call quality on this device is just brilliant.  6.Audio: Audio output from speaker is pretty decent. With earphones sound is very good.  Cons: 1. Missing external SD Card Support. (The biggest con)  2.Performance: Performance is very good in Performance mode but very slightly glitchy in Balanced mode just sometimes. Still looking at the price to performance ratio it's pretty decent.  3.Audio output from speaker is a little low.  NOTE: This review is after the latest firmware update MIUI 6.5.6.0:- which solves all the heating issues while gaming.  Great buy at 13k.

I was in a dilemma reading reviews of fellow buyers in flipkart about heating issues. I still went ahead and bought it. Guess what.. NO REGRETS what so ever. I bought the phone in second flash sale and it was delivered in exactly 24 hrs. Kudos to flipkart. About the phone as mentioned i updated it once i got my hands on it and am using it with wifi uninterrupted and no signs of heating. Use the phone in BALANCED MODE and everything should be fine. Camera works great. And i have to mention about the battery life. It easily lasts over a day with regular usage. Happy with service and phone. Recommend it!

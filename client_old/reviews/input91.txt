Thought of giving a review for Xiaomi Mi 4i I have been using this beauty since a week.  Pros:  1. The Build Quality is awesome 2. The Launcher is clean and neat. 3. Display is awesome with a 441 PPI Display. 4. The Best cam in the market with 2K resolution. 5. Fell in love with the front cam.. 6. Sound quality is clear and so good. 7. Battery easily lasts for a day which includes an hour of gaming, wifi, 3g etc. 8. Unique design ( No trace of Android Lolipop ) 9. No heating issue after the update 10. Slim body and light weight. 11. Permissions is awesome  Cons:  1. Inexpandable memory 2. Lags a bit while multitasking (only 800-900 mb ram is remaining) 3. Can also be 1GB RAM unused if you do not use any background running application.  Thank you. If you find this review useful Give it a thumbsup so that for other users it may be useful

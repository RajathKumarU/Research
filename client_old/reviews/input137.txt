I have been looking for a new phone to replace my old Nokia 701. An android was the choice obviously and finally narrowed it down to Xiaomi. Just happened that the mi 4i had just been launched and got it from Flipkart.  I have to say that I quite like the phone. It is light weight, weighing less that the older Nokia which was not a 5" model. The MIUI interface is a delight to use, making the transition from Nokia to Android very easy.  Downloaded the MI PC Suite to integrate the phone with my PC. But that connects only via USB and not via Bluetooth. The bluetooth integration with my car's hands free system was fuss free and works well.  I like the clock app that came with the phone. You can name and set alarms like in older phones, but also name and set timer alarms too that wasn't possible before.  The games played well for my daughter, with no heating or battery problems.

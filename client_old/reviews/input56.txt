People, Bought this phone for my bro on the first ever sale of Mi4i! I use Mi3 which was bought in its first sale back in Jun14 !! Since then I am big Mi-fan...BUT I dont think its biased review. I am writing this after almost a month & based on my bro's feedback. Nokia design/build quality, iOS like fluid UI and an Android at heart!!! What else you want???  Excellent display - 5/5 Great build quality & form factor - 5/5 Super performance (except few lags due to new Miui on Lollipop, I am sure it will be fixed in future updates; bcoz I have seen Miui6 on Redmi Note without such lags in balanced mode) And this is 64-bit processor, so once all apps are tuned for 64-bit then phone will rock - 4/5 Camera is just excellent! HDR & other effects works as miracle - 5/5 Heating issue & speaker volume issue has been fixed with latest 71mb update! (btw all phones with high cores & bigger battery heats its natural; even old dual-core laptops heats!!) -5/5 Battery is simply superb...every morning 30-40% still left with full time 3G on & decent use of all basic apps daily. -5/5 VFM (value for money) ..it blows away competition. Made in China is getting redefined. Seriously motog only sells for brand name & zenfone for size :) ...Otherwise the specs & quality wise this is just great piece of hardware. - 5/5  Last but not least! Its sin if I dont mention MiUI ... Use it to believe it! This is 'The Best' form of Android in market right now. It has hell lot of features, daily you will discover new one! Miui tips & tricks:: http://en.miui.com/thread-47569-1-1.html This is just tip of an iceberg... And also more features are added with every update in 1-2 months! -- 10/5 ;)  My Conclusion: If budget is less than 20k then just order Mi4i! And if your budget is more than 20k then wait for Mi Note :))  Thanks for reading!

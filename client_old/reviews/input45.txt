Very good phone . 1) Battery is outstanding. 2) No lags 3) rear camera is good . front camera is Outstanding. ( I have got a maximum number of like when I posted a selfie taken from its front cam :) ) 4) touch is very good 5) extremely light weight 6) very elegant looks . But its a bit slippery (it doesn't matters as anyways one is going to buy a flip cover for it) 7)10.5 gb of memory ( fair enough for me) 8) only issue is the Heating issue. But I Can live with it. In fact I have now started using it as a phone and also for ironing my clothes ;) .  Verdict- If you can live with a bit of heating Problem ( Its not that much as people have exaggerated), Then u should surely go for it.

Best mobile in Mi Family.  Stunning clarity with 441 PPI and best in class configuration with 64 bit snapdragon 2nd Gen Processor.  But eKart guys are really worthless they don't know how to treat a customer delivery. I was waiting for 2 hours for my product on weekend but the guy who suppose to deliver me the product promised me that he will deliver me withing half and hour but after that he never picked up my call.  So guys do always COD and get the product and pay for it...

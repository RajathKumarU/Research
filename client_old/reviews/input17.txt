Do not think .. Just go for it ... !  I have received Mi 4i three days ago, After using the phone for three days i have decided to write review about this phone,  Now coming over to the main part that is the pros and cons that would help you to understand better :  Pros:  * Excellent User-Interface , Xiomi has worked hard to carve out an amazing interface for this android phone.  *PPI of 441 offers excellent viewing display at par with high end samsung mobiles when it comes to display quality.  * Gorilla Glass screen - something that you get only in top notch devices. It offers scratch resistant and very smooth smudge resistant screen.  *Dual sim - it is a dual sim phone - supports micro sim  * Call quality is very crisp and clear because it has an active noise cancellation mic.  *Wi-Fi , GSM /WCDMA/3G/ GPS connectivity is very good.  * Camera - .. it has a very good camera . Primary camera is of 13 mp , while the secondary camera is of 5 mp and comes with a beautify feature will surely be liked by selfie lovers. There are a lot of modes for the camera tha can be handy. Picture quality can be compared to Nokia or Samsung high end phones.  * Excellent battery backup with 3120 mah bettery  Cons :  * Day 1 after using the phone for 3-4 hours i obseved phone started heating However since i updated the the Mi Phone version to Mi 6 heating problem seems to be resoved.  * Phone does't have any external memory card slot which is biggest drawback of this phone because out of 16 Gb of internal memory only 12 Gb is availabe for users which seems to be very less.  *sound of the loudspeaker is not too loud,  i would say overall its an excellent phone under 15000 by Xiomi.  Just go for it without any thoughts. Heating problem will be resolved once you update the phone application for Sure :)

I have good experience of 2 Mi phones, still I was little cautious while ordering Mi 4i. But I was surprised once I received the phone. It is very light weight and smaller in size. All the Pros given by Mi as well as others stand true, so I will not talk about it again. I will say it is a good phone for a given price point, though price is little higher. Price should be little lower, 11999/- or Mi Band should be given along with the phone.  In fact, I will discuss cons (or not positive points) in detail. - Screen size: 4.92 inches as against claim of 5 inch. But then PPI is increased, which is good!! - AnTuTu Benchmark score: 39540 marginally less as against claim of 40253 - Sim card tray is not of good quality - Memory: 16 GB. Internal storage: 11;9 GB, available is 9.4 GB (I feel Mi should increase the built-in memory) - I observed little heating at the back cover. But cant argue with it. Only metallic bodies can disseminate heat faster. Most of the new phones bound to have heating problem. - RAM: 2 GB. Available RAM is less than 1 GB - Non-removable battery

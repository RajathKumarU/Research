Very fast delivery from Flipkart. I got it in a day. Very happy with service of Flipkart but the back cover and screenguard could have been provided by same seller WSR unfortunately for these you havo to lookout for other sellers. I booked screen guard and back cover on same day of this item booking but still i didn't get the items its already 5 days and they are still in transit.  Writing this review based on 5 days of usage of Mi4i. Both cameras are good. Good touch response. Smooth performance - No lags.  Pathetic thing is it Heats up a lot when playing games, using internet, Using camera and charging :(  Battery depends on usage.. Continuous usage will last for 5 to 6 hrs.. Medium user can get complete day.. and if used only for calls then will get for 2 days approx.  Dual sim standby works perfectly.  Due to heating issue i will not recommend to buy this as heating device annoys a lot. hence i have given only 3 stars.

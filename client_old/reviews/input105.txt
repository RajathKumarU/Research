MI4i seems to be awesome mobile but with certain cons. Display is awesome Mi has surely done a good job. Sunlight visibility is good, but the sunlight feature what they described works only when you put torch light on the light sensor. with normal sunlight there seems to be no change in the display.  performance is too good (change the default settings to "performance mode" which will be in "balanced mode" in default to increase the device performance and speed).  no heavy heating issue even with heavy games, except during charging the mobile, compared to the other mobiles having 615soc. speaker sound is good. no problem with internet/network connectivity even while travelling in car/bus. Battery charges very fast thanks to the fast charging adaptor.  camera is good in bright day light, but very very poor in low or dim light. seems like 6-8mp camera. if camera is your preference then mi4i is not ur choice. battery drains like anything. it comes only for 7-8hrs of normal usage. and 5-6hrs with heavy usage.  overall mi4i is a good choice if camera and battery back up is not ur priority.

This is my 1st Xiaomi MI4i, i was a user of Samsung Note 3 & iPhone 5s. MI4i and excellent phone, Its flawless in every aspect. Please go for it. Well, 16GB is enough for storing songs 600mp3 and 30mp4 videos. Many people have complain about heating isue.Lets come to me perception , people who r saying its getting heated up during 1st boot& setting up the phone for the 1st time. i guess they haven't use any smart phone either. Its obvious while booting for the 1st time any phone will get heated up. Because all the applications will be running along with WIFI with highest performing speed to update apps UI, screen will be light-up for long time. Charging for 1st time may heat up a bit. leave the phone to get fully charged. use it for a day or 2. Turn off the 4G LTE, always use GSM for better call connectivity and a great battery life. . Turn on for G when it requires. i bet , you are not going to face heating issue . At least i am not facing any heating issue.

Purchased this mobile during the Big Billion Day sale and although Flipkart took ages to deliver this, the wait was worth every paisa.  Before buying this device, I read tons of review and how it became hot even after slight usage. To all of those people, my simple advice is update the device!!! As soon as I turned on the mobile, there was a 860 mb update waiting for me. I decided to test out something and delayed that update. Installed Asphalt 8, Nova and it did get heated up quite a lot after playing for 5 minutes. After installing the update, the heating simply went away.  The only con for me was the 16 Gb storage which can somehow be circumvented by OTG.  The sound was really low and I suspected a software issue; so I updated to miui7 developer rom. That way there are no more issues with sound anymore.  As far the rest of the device goes, it is simply superb! Go for it!

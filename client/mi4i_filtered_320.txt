0|1|I purchase a mi4i and the speaker doesnt works. However i have been trying to return the product / opt for a replacement but company representatives cancel return requests on one superficial reason or other Really Irritated
1|1|First and foremost, it is an awesome phone with just one problem, 16 GB internal memory. If can do with that, just go for it. But if it is awesome, why am I giving this 1 star review. This has to do with the Flipkart return and refund policy and the "might be" inferior product product supply they offer. Purchased this phone in May,got a faulty one, so applied for a replacement piece. The device was then PICKED UP by Flipkart on 30 July, and kept the replacement on hold. Each time I made a phone call, I was given a 24 to 48 hour deadline to "resolve" the issue. After 20 days, I receive the news that the replacement has been cancelled and I will receive the refund for my purchase. And here is the most interesting part that I was told by the executive: Flipkart will initiate a refund after 4-5 days of picking up the product. Quite interestingly, the product they are refering to has ALREADY been picked 20 days ago. (Most probably they have got a time machine) Nevertheless, when I provide the proof of the pickup ; the reciept of courier pickup and the email from a Flipkart executive confirming their reception of product, I am told that their system is not showing any update in that regard and they have to confirm it from their warehouse which will again take their golden ratio of 24-48 hours. Thank you Flipkart for such an awesome service.
0|1|Worst ever 30 days return policy If any one purchasing this xiaomi mi4i mobile plz read it carefully or contact me(sachin.achara@yahoo.com) because i will help much any time as i cheated by flipkart First of all fake 30 days return policy 2nd heating will not covered in return or replacrment even the temperature goes over 45 degree if need i will show the result.. Third after open sale xiaomi is replacing sony camera with poor quality samsung camera so beware this Flipkart will replace the mobile only when a smart check application result will show defect and this result not show defect result because this is developed by seller side to reject the return.. So this smart check is also fake done by flipkart but we cant see the result.. The result will uploaded with hidden policy this all is done to reject the return or replacrment... And all customer care suggest the same solution to go to xiaomi service centre but xiaomi service centre is not many only one in rajasthan in jaipur so problem remains same after 3000 t0 4000 money spent no solition will found because xiaomi will send it to banglore service centre and customer will have to wait for 1 month.... At last mobile aspect Pros... Best display ...... Best front camera Light weight Many sensor and touch is so smoth Cons... Poor heating issue above 45 Always near to 40 Rear camera average Poor speaker High SAR value No memory card ...... But at end if you can bear 40 to 45 degree temperature then go for it But beware... Flipkart will not replace or return mobile or money even temperature goes above 50....
0|1|Mi4i is getting over heated after we use it for 5 - 10 minutes. Its really embarrassing with flipkart return policy. They say that if there's any problem with the product within 30 days, they would replace the produc. But when I raised the ticket, flipkart executive asks to install some app to varify. Even after installing that app, the product replacement was rejected . Amazon return policy is quite good compared to flipkart. When there's any problem with product they will refund the money. Flipkart return policy is very disgusting and annoying, as there's no option to refund money, when product sold was not upto mark.
1|1|how can the phone be returned ??? its getting heated up very fast.. I think flipcart/xiaomi forgot the law (420) :- battery space mentioned on the website and on the actual product delivered are different website spec of battery is 3120mAh product delivered with 3030mAh After update, still heating issue
0|1|Within 2 days of buying the Mi4i the loudspeaker stopped functioning. And it's been over 10 days since the issue has been brought to Flipkart's notice to resolve, and after having gone through the technical team's process of determining flaws in the product, the issue is still not resolved. Now, I'm asked to proceed to the Xiaomi service center to take a look (which I had already done as the first step). Terrible process for customers to go through, especially after buying the Mi4i with much anticipation. Xiaomi/ Flipkart... you have much work to do in the post-sale customer services!!
0|5|Before writing, I would like to let every reader know that I had used Micromax Unite 2, Galaxy S3, Redmi 1S, Redmi Note, YU Yureka in the past. I too have an Apple iPhone 6 Gold. So my review is purely based on my experiences. 1) The phone is pretty slim, small in size & light weight; even smaller than Redmi 1S and same size as Unite 2. Whereas it has a 5" display comparing the other two's 4.7". Top and bottom Bezel of the phone is small making the display looks bigger. It is slightly bigger than iPhone 6. Just a little bit! This feature makes the phone more pocket friendly and fits in hand perfectly. So much light weight that my friends said it will fly off from one's hands! In terms of looks, I will give it 5 stars! 2) Build Quality; The polycarbonate body of the phone doesn't looks cheap as those of Redmi 1S or Redmi Note. It has mat finish though feels slippery sometimes. It is really prone to finger prints, grease and oil. I love its body! But, due to its slim profile, the gyroscopic sensors placed near the secondary mic., does gives odd sound like springs when stightly hit on that area. Sometimes this sound makes the phone's status really cheap. But using a hard case solved the problem. Build quality got 4 stars from my side. 1 star deducted for that sound! 3) Performance, Heating Issue and Software; Performance is good and somewhat better than Yureka. I played Asphalt 8: Airborne both in balanced and performance mode at normal settings and it played well! No glitches! Yeah, the phone heats but from my experience, the highest temp. I found was 49.7°C while playing Asphalt 8. Yureka exceeds 65°C sometimes! So, 2nd Gen improved pretty well :) And we all know after all its a Snapdragon! Heating is not a big issue for those who had experienced Redmi 1S and Yureka. Software? MIUI 6 is damn awesome! My 1st experience on MIUI 6, I used the v5 in my earlier phones but this one is really appreciated. Although there were some lags but after the 800 mb update, its better now! And yeah, 5 stars for its performance, software and heating :P 4) Display, Camera and Battery; Display is fantastic! Better than iPhone 6! I was shocked to see the details on it. I have tested the Sunlight display, trust me, its too perfect! The phone's screen looks pure black matching with the bezel's black colour while screen off. This makes the phone more premium. It is nearly impossible for one to distinguish the display's sides from 1/2m away from the phone. Mi 4i's IPS LCD's colour reproduction is as good as the Samsung's Amoled displays, even better. Camera is once again WOW! Everything is better! 1st time I experienced Xiaomi camera when I bought Redmi 1S. It's 1.6MP front camera was far better than most of the Micromax's 5MP, 8MP cam smartphones. The camera of Mi 4i is really a DSLR type. I have clicked lots of photographs with much details and I am happy with it. Yes, iPhone 6 slightly better... just a little bit! But considering the price difference, I can say Xiaomi really worked hard on the Camera and Display of this phone. Speaker is average. Not below average but average. It is more powerful than Redmi Note. But in crowded fish market, you will not be able to hear ur ringtone so better switch to vibration+ringtone :D Now remained battery Back-up! Yeah, battery back-up is good but not the best for a 3120 MAh. Yeah! Although it has lots juice but juice drains faster due to MIUI. But yeah, it passes a day in normal usages or balanced mode. In performance mode, not more than 6-8 hrs! Anyways, one can even pass two days with it by reducing the brightness or switching to Marathon mode! I can blindly give 5 stars for its Display, Camera and battery. Also for the speakers because I always uses silent mode or vibration mode! 5) Network speed, Storage management and Box contains; Its network speed is really fast. I have used both 3G and 2G and I felt Mi 4i's 2G is faster than Yureka's 2G whereas 3G speed is equal for both the devices. I used same network provider for the test. Mi 4i catches tower pretty fast and call clarity is good! Storage management?You saw it features 16GB emmc. So buy an OTG Pendrive and do save ur photos/videos there once in a week or two! It comes with 10GB free storage and you can make it nearly 12GB by uninstalling some unnecessary google apps. Box contains Data cable, 2amp crager which is pretty fast and some literature... A sim ejecting tool is also provided. Box looks good. Note:- Just like all the Xiaomi devices, it too doesn't comes with earphones. Verdct:- After using the device for two weeks, I would recommend everyone to buy this product! Just blindly go for it. You will not get this type of phone under 15k. I am in love with this Slim, Hot and Sexy smartphone. :P Giving 5 stars cuz this phone worth it!
1|1|Its got over heated when idle and while calling its getting heat. Very poor quality and sound quality is also very poor and not able to hear ringer. There is network issue, webpages is not loading, every time loading error coming. Kindly return money. No replacement. ASAP
1|1|Screen, Build quality, UI and Battery backup was out standing, But keep mind it its more important then that it has very heavy heating issue, while plug in to charge it was started to heat like a iron box. The most important thing is more that 3 min while in a call, it was started to heat it really irritating u cont able to continue the call. clearly u would able to feel the heating sense. While using 2G, 3G internet, Cam for more then 2 min, HD games with in a min u feel it started to heat. So i started the process of returning it..! There s lot of mobile under 13k without heating issue. what ever the high-end features they had given, the heating issue makes the phone feels like a shit on hand..! kindly go for some other mobile don't waste ur valuable money, it s good to see the features and screen but not able to use it for long term .
1|1|In order to get best performance, installed the over 800 Mb update that was indicated in the settings. Experience is as follows: Heats up on simple tasks like ten minutes of chatting on whatsapp or attending a 5 minute call. Battery gets gets drained fast. The battery might at max have a 1500 mAh capacity. Sound quality of speaker is poor. My 4 yr old Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S runs a live wall paper like Juice Pro much more smoothly. In Mi4i, the movements are sluggish and slow. Compared the performance against my Samsung Galaxy Grand using Quadrant Standard and results showed that the I/O and 2D are better in Samsung. 3D is almost same for both. At this price they could have atleast provided earphones. So total waste of money as there is only option of replacement and not refund.
0|4|Hello Guys, This is my 7th Xiaomi Mobile buying from my Flipkart account. Just received it today. 4 Star for this mobile and 0 rating for their service center. Pros:- Full HD resolution. Full HD video Recording. The mobile fits perfectly in the hands even its size is 5 inches because of the smaller edges similar to the size of RedMi 2. Camera is okay Back panel is not finger print prone. It comes with Android Lollipop version. Bigger battery. Remember that this review is only based on the 3 hours of usage of this mobile. Cons:- A bit lagging in performance. Sound output is very low from the speakers. Back Camera is not that great when compared to MI 3. Only Mobile and Charger provided in the box. No Screen Guard/No pouch provided. The main con for Xiaomi is the service center guys. My MI 3 mobile screen damaged and when I went to the store they asked me to pay 15K mentioning that they need to replace mother board too. Guys the Mobile itself 14K. I went to some local service center and repaired it for only 3K. The mobile parts are very costly. After sales service is pathetic. They opened many service centers which is good but the people in the service centers are not knowledgeable enough. They know nothing about servicing a mobile. So think twice before you buy Xiaomi. Their mobiles are good but not service. So if you buy xiaomi make sure you take care of it, if something happens to your mobile then I suggest you to go for a new mobile instead of their service centers.
0|1|My piece of mi4i heats up post-charging. This was on the first instant of complete charging after pulling-it out from the box and thereafter. I had placed for replacement hoping this was one defective product. However, the callback executive's responses made me feel that I should go for a refund. Her suggestions were to: 1) Check for temperature and if it is below 45degrees, it is normal ! 2) If an update of software would be done, it will solve multiple problems and heating could be ! 3) etc.. She was going on and on. Am I a tester for mi4i ?? I just asked for the product to be taken-back and tested before a return is given. However, she claimed that this is not covered under such policy until all the above tests are done. Agitated by her response, I asked for refund. Now she claims that this product doesn't qualify for refund !. She was not willing to email the link which says that refund is not possible. This only makes me feel that the branding on this is just too hyped ! and support is too poor. NOTE: This is the behavior/experience of my product. You might always find contrary views.
0|5|Awesome phone...no lags..no heating problem...great UI.... + Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS - No headphones - lack of accessories in market IMPORTANT POINT: Update your phone before using it, there is a update of 800mb. IT WILL SOLVE THE HEATING ISSUE ETC.....
1|1|Don't have option to give negative rating.. its got Over heated while using. very poor quality.... not recommend... sound quality is also very poor. not able to hear ringer.. I requested flipkart to replace/return the set within 24 hours of receiving. They told me to give a call back from so called technical department. However, everytime they called and disconnected the call and postponing the call for next day... Issue not resolved till date...Despite of being an regular customer at flipkart, i am disappointed this time too much... Will not login back to flipkart in future. kindly return money. no replacement
0|5|1.Awesome device..great build quality,,easy to use single handed,great camera's front and back both.And yes android lollipop does bring change to os with material design effect to apps.Best one is Mi series with dual sim support..loved it,,which is missing in my mi3. 2.and when we start device first time it loads os first time setting up location,accounts,checking updates,syncing contacts,email and other data,dual sim configuration and lots of things at a First time... so give it time to settle down all things normally done .make all accounts sync..make all apps updates,and also it has new os update near about 800 Mb.. Do that update....And then talk about the device..it works perfectly without any issue...Not Any heating Problems....Some idiots write review how it heated.. I bet they not even update their device..So take your time to make your review... 3.Also i have seen every single review on youtube spacially C4ETECH i want to tell them if your so called iPhone with dual core processor and with 1Gb ram become flagship device then open your eyes Mi 4i has 1.7 GHz + 2nd-gen Snapdragon 615 64-bit octa-core with 2 Gb Ram with great display and rest u can search on Google... 4.If you are looking for great phone having budget more than Rs.20000 also buy this phone..It is excellent mobile in every category. update after use of near about three weeks of use: 1.It gives 3G or LTE opt only that sim slot on which you are using Internet. 2.Also Xiaomi said it support Battery about 3120 mAh and the packaging box says 3030 mAh Little bit confusing or misleading. 3.Got Update of about 60 MB on 21 May and it become lots more smoother experience. 4.Tempered glass compatible mi4i finding on flipcart is now impossible for me i got two broken which wr covering half front camera.Another was of mi4 having same problem. 5.Back covers of karpine white color is great but i prefer another dark color for avoid becoming dirty. Best luck
1|2|I had a Mi3 earlier and was very happy with it. I readily switched to the Mi4i, primarily for 4G connectivity. Its been 2 full days since I have been using this phone and here are my first impressions: 1) Battery Life: Very Poor. The battery get fully drained out in 12-18 Hrs of moderate usage. 2) Performance: I am not into gaming but the phone is sluggish even for the most basic tasks like browsing. The animations etc. lag the touch (Check tab switching for Chrome Browser). 3) Bluetooth connection to my Moto360 is not stable and the watch keeps dropping connection. I have to switch off and on the bluetooth to reconnect. 4) Internet connectivity on 4G keeps dropping connection and again switch off/on brings the connectivity back. 5) Camera is generally fine but lacks the detail when taking a brightly lit shot. And now some positives: 1) Screen is really good. 2) Size and feel of the mobile is good. The negatives outweigh the positives by a huge margin and I just wish I had my Mi3 back, this one just doesn't work for me.
0|4|This is my 1st Xiaomi MI4i, i was a user of Samsung Note 3 & iPhone 5s. MI4i and excellent phone, Its flawless in every aspect. Please go for it. Well, 16GB is enough for storing songs 600mp3 and 30mp4 videos. Many people have complain about heating isue.Lets come to me perception , people who r saying its getting heated up during 1st boot& setting up the phone for the 1st time. i guess they haven't use any smart phone either. Its obvious while booting for the 1st time any phone will get heated up. Because all the applications will be running along with WIFI with highest performing speed to update apps UI, screen will be light-up for long time. Charging for 1st time may heat up a bit. leave the phone to get fully charged. use it for a day or 2. Turn off the 4G LTE, always use GSM for better call connectivity and a great battery life. . Turn on for G when it requires. i bet , you are not going to face heating issue . At least i am not facing any heating issue.
0|1|I think I have made mistake by purchasing Mi 4i this is heating up every time when I am using this phone
0|4|After doing research on the latest phones , I bought this phone. Review of mi 4i after upgrading to 6.5.5 MIUI stable version PROS: Build is perfect for usage as well to place in pocket Amazing Screen Good battery life High speed network connectivity in performance mode(better than iphone6 in my test) HDR Photos are very good at its price range Got it for Rs,11,700 in Flipkart during offer days with 24-hour delivery One hand usage is good. CONS: Slight warm on continuous use of 20 min or more Volume and Power buttons are sharp at the corners(doesn't feel premium) Plastic body feels delicate, especially if you have kids Micro USB connector is not comfortable while plugging in or removing the pin(very tight) Limited memory Loud Speaker is not great; OK sound 1 GB is used by MIUI and if you open a couple of apps, the remaining RAM shows 700MB(RAM is not being used optimally) Some Observations in my usage Ran Antutu BenchMark Tests after OS upgrade: balanced mode 31k performance mode 39k Used the phone extensively in balanced mode Full battery got charged in less than 3 hrs with the 2A charger given along with the phone When using the camera/browsing/gaming for 30 min makes the phone warm (Not heating); Same thing observed in my htc also; felt not a problem Basic camera settings doesn't give very good photos; need to do small changes for good photos FaceBook app hanged once in my use. Network speed is amazingly fast (compared to my htc one X and iphone6) Screen looks little dull at 50% brightness compared to other phones at same brightness level Ran few games like temple run without any issues Loud speaker sound is on the lower side Receiver sound during calls also is not on the higher side; It is Ok 1 GB RAM is always used by MIUI; only 900MB to 1 GB left for the user. If you open large number of apps, may be a problem; Tried with 7 to 8 apps, no issues. Ran Asphalt8 for 10 min in balanced mode; didn't face any UI lags; but the device became warm beside the camera, checked the temp - it is around 40 (same thing on my htc was 40, but because of the material and build, i dont feel it much on my htc) may be because of the chipset density and octa core in mi 4i,so i am feeling 40 also as light heat on the outside.
0|5|This phone is excellent in terms of style, performance, battery and camera. Too weightless and had a mat finished like back panel Cant say that this device didnt heats up...actually it does..but only when you are charging or using mobile internet. MIUI is as fluid as iphone..in fact its superior with a lots of features; like "one hand use",themes etc The only con i had found is that the sound is only average(or below average). Display and camera are excellent. (both rear and front) superb call quality Battery is more than average than other android phones. All the sensors are working perfectly. Will update this after a months usage. _____________________________________________________________ Don't hesitate. Its the best you are going to get at this price ! _____________________________________________________________
0|5|Firstly you cannot find a phone like at this price point which concludes 90% of the review. For rest I would say the phone is absolutely made up of good material no cheap feeling except for plastic back cover slim , light though i find it slippery but i just came in from Moto G universe where there is too much of gravity. Yes the phone does gets heated up but do update the MIUI update which has arrived and it only happens when you run in performance mode and play games like Nova 3 in Balanced mode i could not find any issues at all as with all device it would heat up even the overly procey iPhone 6 gets heated and I'm sure Xiaomi will fix with a software update so not to worry.There is also hoo laaa made by lot of people thats its heating please its not the way internet is saying. Overall i would say very good phone , great battery the dual sim works very well using both sims with no issues , the default music app is also good but not as good as player pro. Giving it 5 stars just because its the price at which its being offered.
0|5|Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing (here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing, its quite common , i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating, gets warm during browsing) i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly.
1|1|Great phone , cool features , interface is really nice.. BUT The heating is so bad that it is unbearable to make a call...It gets really hot close to the camera side and front top side. I don't run any games at all, even then.I have never experienced anything like this in a phone. Can MI fix this through a software update ? The device is really great..but this issue can be deal breaker any day...
0|1|Please don't buy this product.its like a heating pad.I just started setting up the phone on first boot up the phone got heated up and it is really unbearable to use.
1|1|Worst phone. heating like anything. Please call back all the phones and release a bug fixed phone. After two days of usage, 1. There is mechanical/hardware integration issue on the panel, you can see the lights penetrating outside from down side of the phone(exactly down side to the Back and Home button). this is damaged product by manufacturing itself. many others reported the same issue in the review 2. After MIUI update, the space is reduced about 2GB. 3. Out of 2GB RAM, 1.1GB was taken by Android Lollipop itself. 4. Cant play games, lagging and heating issues are there. 5. Definitely not worth for money, 6. The volume and Power buttons are so delicate. you can observe rattling of the keys. Kind Attn: MI Do something, buying a phone is not like buying vegetables in the market, its generally, 1-3 years plan. don't cheat people. you will loose your market in India. Hi Flipkart, you can convince people easily to opt this product. but remember, because of these kind of third parties, you are loosing your name. Dont encourage these ODMs for few cents. you may end up your growth exponentially. Flipkart didn't do anything for my return request. so please be careful guys. don't burnt your hands by buying this mobile.
0|2|1.sound quality so bad. 2.U can miss many calls due to poor sound. 3.why they use power amplifier. 4.Fake declaration by flipkart. 4.overall phone is ok I perches this phone but due to sound issue i complain to flipkart So the exchange my phone.So i hope for sound improvement.
1|1|I and my friends got three sets of this mobile on the first sale. This mobile looks great and its really good. But all we are facing overheating issue while calling and playing games or doing any multi tasking work. Temperature goes to 48 C. Sometime call disconnected due to heating. If you want to buy please wait for resolve this issue then only buy.
0|1|So many bugs regarding proximity sensor issue, heating issue and sound issuer. The worst thing is they are not taking back this product so easily. They are playing with the customer for return policy. I request you all not to buy this product. The worst product from MI.
1|1|Hi, If i open any applications with in 5 Min it heated to much and Internet related issue. Regards, Ravi
1|1|Issues with the phone. 1. LED leak at bottom of the screen, under the back-lit buttons. 2. Phone overheats even with brief usage on 3G/WIFI. Have requested for return. Waiting for reply from Flipkart.
0|4|This Phone has the best camera considering the price....the display is gr8 and batteruy life too...the only roblem is heating...which is bcoz of snapdragon 615 processor but this phone does not heat up in day to day usage but if u are a heavy user the temp. will rise up till 44 degrees.!
1|1|The hardware is faulty, there is a leak in the display. When i'm in a completely dark room, I can see light from the capacitative buttons leaking from the bottom edge of the phone. Phone is overheating too much even with light usage. Requested for a replacement yesterday, Flipkart hasn't responded yet. Edit May 12th: Update - I requested for a replacement and got it, but to my horror, it had the exact same problem. I went to MIUI forums and found at least a dozen other users with this same defect, before Xiaomi made sure the posts(and similar posts) disappeared into oblivion. I have returned the phones and demanded money back. I don't think i'll ever buy a xiaomi phone again.
0|1|No games, no web surfing still heating to extent that I can't hold it near my ear. I used the phone for 10 mins going through settings of phone and it heat up considerably. All this when I am 'balanced' battery profile, not even "performance". Mr Hugo, what's the point of all these specs if you cant hold the phone in your hand or keep in the pocket because one would have to visit doctor for treating burns. Many now have reported heating issue. DO SOMETHING XIAOMI.
0|4|1st of all Flipkart guys are awesome as always with packing and deliver The feel holding itself pretty good, can use d phone in one hand, no fingerprints on the back Full HD display , camera quality is superb with low and bright,glaring light... Mi stock recovery 2.0.1 notification pops up pretty soon, & updates are quick. Only problem u gotta deal is Heating issue, it did heat up during the setup itself... Performance is cool. Appearance both of the hardware & software is superb, If u got the bucks, dont waste it on somethin else ..this 1s total value 4 it
1|1|Over heating device after 4 minutes continue talk, also not support video of resolution 322*240. for Low resolution video it first play only audio and after audio finish start to play video without audio.
1|5|Expected a phone thats a cheap close of Mi4 but when I unboxed it the phone really amazed me. The build quality is good, infact it doesn't look cheap! UI is a little complicated when u use it first and it runs smoothly. No lags at all till now. The phone did get a bit warm it was used for an hour straight but thats not an issue. Kinda disappointed again as there were no Earphones in the package as i expected it to be there with higher end models. Overall its a good phone. Looks cool! Performs well.. Camera is decent. And the Display is very impressive too. Sunlight Tech adapts to lighting conditions well. If you are looking to buy this phone. Go for it!!
0|1|I never thought of making omelettes and half boils on a phone but, Yes, this is MI 4i makes that definitely possible. I didn't even installed any games and when i'm just setting up my mobile for 1st use,the HEAT was unbearable.. I was a bit shocked and place back MI 4i in its box. Later after 20min, You just don't need to touch the phone but by touching box itself you can notice HEAT...that was too much hot, this is really troublesome and fearful I hate Xiomi for releasing such a worst phone for Indians. I think Mi can't fool anyone here in the next release...
1|1|There is software problem all icon got black. Fast dailing issue..heating problm.battry discharge if we connect charger without power on. Always phone used more then 1.4 GB of ram i have not installet any other apps or running anything but always show 890 or 640 free of 2GB.. ROM usable only 10.80GB of 16GB when i recived the phone. Ring sound is low. Didnot show the miss call on home or lock screen just a small icon in top left notificatin of miss call Please dont by this phone itsnoy good
0|1|I just started setting up the phone on first boot up (location, language, google account etc.,). The phone got heated up and it is really unbearable to use. Phone design, camera, MIUI etc., looks great but I cant compromise on heating issue for these features!!!
0|1|OD202844757552367300 was autocancelled after reaching my nearest hub. No logical reason available with customer care. Shall i opt for consumer court?
0|1|I have used it only for 2-3 hrs and its temp bump to 42 degree.... seems like cheaper phones are not worth buying. Note - updated MIUI latest patch but still issue persist
1|1|Phone is handy, compact looks good...but has heating problem while multitasking.. It gets heated near camera and sometimes become too hot while playing high HD games & is connected to wifi....:/
0|5|Overheating?: I was initially concerned about the reports of overheating from reviews on FK as well as from some reviewers. After using the phone for a few days I have not experienced any overheating. Like all phones, it gets a bit warm if you use it while charging and also for highly intensive games. But even during gaming, it never got too hot, just slightly warm. This is on Asphalt 8, Subway Surfers and Clash of Clans. Design: The device feels extremely great in your hand, even better than the Mi 3 and much nicer than the bigger phablets like Zenfone 2 and Honor 4x. The matte finish make the device feel premium. Every person I have shown my phone to has first commented on how light it feels, but also remarked how solid it is. Battery: The battery has been great, easily lasts me a day with some room to spare. Display: This is the main reason why I decided to buy the Mi 4i. The display is unparalleled in this price range and even in 20k+ devices. 1080p display just looks beautiful. The Corning OGS glass is same as GG 3 and makes me feel safe with my purchase. Also, I thought Sunlight Display was just a marketing gimmick, but it actually makes it easier to use my phone outdoors. Performance: Really love the performance of this phone. There are some minor lags after playing games for 30min+. Once the device cools down again it works as normal. Overall: Best phone since Mi 3. Don't believe the overheating reports until you actually use the phone. I was worried after watching a YouTube video showing really bad overheating, but he switched on performance mode. I have not seen any overheating in default mode and am still able to play all the games I want.
0|1|Touch---- fine Processing--- fine Camera---- not even compete with 8MP of my HTC one x Heating is an issue Battery --- seems they just tell 3120 otherwise its backup is like 2000 mAh only Built Quality--- Not looks like a brand... cheap Chinese mobile types Sound quality... very poor Even Headphone not provided Flipkart must confirm the quality of the product before they selling new products, i m totally disappointed with this.
0|5|It's just awesome... they said it's a "FLAGSHIP" mobile...it's definitely true. only con i prefer to say is heating issue. when a game app runs is background..mob is started to heat...other than that...this mobile is fantastic and lovely... pros: >superb selfie cam(5mp) and 13mp jst awe me... >outer look >MIUI simply great >all the ETC...they said in specification...
0|5|Final Verdict: Go for it !!!! First thought: I'm writing this review after using Mi4i for 2 days. After unboxing, the first thing that caught my attention were the build quality, ergonomic feel and light weightiness of the device. What a display: The display is exceptionally good and smooth to touch. The colors and resolution is amazing at this price point. Although, i haven't tried any high performance games yet, there are no lags or performance failure. Heating??? Nah, just warming up for normal people like me!! Felt warm initially, but after updating the software (to MIUI 6.5.3.0), it hasn't felt any warmer than any other device people are using these days. If you put pressure on the processor, which smartphone would stay cool? Please don't ask for a BMW at the price of a Honda City. The battery does hold up for a day and a half at normal usage. All in all, i would recommend this phone to anyone thinking to go to the next step from below 10k devices. The device you're getting is worth every penny!
1|2|Not happy with Mi 4i... Issues: 1. Phone was heating when I use Mobile Internet, Phone calls and even for Camera usage also... 2. They mentioned RAM as 2GB but system is taking 1GB for basic services running and if we install any app on mobile, then it is having only 500-600 MB free, hence applications are launching very slowly (Some times unresponsive) Planning to return after 1-2 days of usage.. if it still the same, i'll return the mobile.
0|1|Pro's : 1) Promised display quality 2) Unique MI UI (user experience). 3) Form factor 4) Light weight(I dont know how many would consider that a plus) and fits well in hands. Con's: 1) Speaker is a big drawback. Put google maps and the lady who navigates you can never be heard even if you keep the phone close to your ears. Ask your friend to call you and put it on speaker. There is no way you can ever hear him even in absolute silence let alone some noise. Seriously flawed speakers. 2) Processor, if it is a quad core and takes longer than a 512 mb old phone (Remember those days when we click on camera icon and wait for the camer or gallery to appear for ever?), to fire up an app, then the manufacturer is either lying to you or its just a way too bad processor. 3) Camera is not good and goes to prove that just 13MP is just a number. 4) Heat, heat and just too much heat : If you can keep this Mi 4i next to your ear for more than one minute without feeling the heat (And that tall claim about SAR, that seems B.S), trust me, you got really lucky. Because all the phones I checked are getting hotter than one can imagine. 5) Touch response is weird. I am touching on the right bottom button at the bottom of the display and it is opening the icon above it. And I checked this 100 times. 6) Most of your memory is already taken up by the time you receive the phone. Only 500-700 mb left. I fail to understand why I bought a 2GB phone. To see that it is all taken up ? 7) Phone is dead slow. Summary : The last time I bought Moto E, I was so impressed with it that I literally made 30 people buy it. I plan on doing the same with Mi 4i. Only this time,I want to discourage as many people as possible from buying it . I plan on spreading the word as much as possible. Really, trust me. Its not worth it.
0|1|battery not getting fully charged,charging stops automatically after sometime,i have asked for replacement.....bad experience
1|5|Phone is pretty good !!!! No abnormal heating and the heat it generates is normal for a phone of this Kind !!! First Xiaomi Product !!! Happy with the performance !!! Camera beyond my expectations !!!! Total worth for money !!! Only concern is Service centers !!!! Hope ill not get any issues atleast for an year until I get another one !!!!
1|4|Hi, Bought this phone in the third flash sale because I was waiting to know the reviews about this phone from the previous customers. So far, this phone has been very impressive and I have no complaints (just a missing external memory card slot, which is not really a big deal). This phone was delivered in a day's time, which was good. Following things I've noticed after using my phone; HEATING - This phone heats up normally like every other phone, it has no extensive heating issues like every other person has been complaining about in their reviews. If you play heavy games continuously for like 10 minutes or so, the phone heats up a little bit, but that is completely normal. Even while charging or talking on the phone for quite sometime, the phone will heat up, but in a normal way like almost every other phone. I had updated my phone almost immediately after opening the package, so I don't know about the heating issue before the update, but as of now, its completely fine. CAMERA - The camera in this phone is freaking brilliant. If you're getting blurred photos from your Mi4i camera, then you're just not focusing it properly because it has a manual focus as well (tap on the screen where you want to focus). None of my photos have come out blur (what I had focused on came out crisp clear). The front camera is also equally good. Sometimes the photos do come out a little (just a little) grainy, but remember, sometimes even digital cameras and dslrs' produce a little grainy photos and that is not the fault of the camera. Grainy photos are produced due to low light. RAM - 2gb RAM helps a lot. The phones barely lags and when it does, its for barely a second and that is totally manageable. I've noticed that the phone lags only when I switch from app to app very quickly, like when you open one app by mistake and realize that's not the app you wanted to open and then you click the home button and then quickly click on the other app, that's when the phone lags. That's not even the right way to operate a phone I think, so I'd take the blame for that. There is a shortcut button for task messenger (left bottom, feather touch button) which shows what all apps are running in the background and you have the option to kill those apps instantly. After the first update, the free memory after killings all apps would be around 400mb. I got a third update (one day before writing this review) and after that the free memory goes up to 700mb. No worries about the RAM in this phone and no lag issues. INTERNAL MEMORY - Of course, an external memory card slot would have been a major plus point, but quite frankly 16gb memory is enough. You get to use almost 10gb only because the system also uses a lot of memory. If you think you're running low on phone memory, then please check the photos that you've clicked from your phone and the music list. I had low memory issues with my previous phone only because of excessive and unwanted photos and music in my phone. Otherwise, the memory issue should not be there. SPEAKER/HEADPHONES - The volume of the sound is actually less, even at full volume. Sound quality is not bad. People have been complaining about poor sound quality and that isn't the case. Sound quality is definitely not great, but it's definitely not bad. Sad thing is, earphones were not provided along with this phone. So pair up your phone with some really good earphones and enjoy the music. BATTERY - Though the battery capacity is really good, I don't get a very good backup as I use too many things on the phone and some heavy apps. If you play a lot on this phone (or any other phone also), the battery will die faster. Internet browsing, facebook, whatsapp, games, etc do drain the battery, but there are certain apps which run in the background which also helps in draining the battery. The default security app scans the phone at times without your notice, but I'm not sure if that does too much damage. Otherwise, the battery backup is good. Lasts properly for a day and a half with heavy usage of the phone. DESIGN - The phone has a very beautiful and a minimal design, nothing unnecessary on the front or the back. The back panel is a little slippery, but it ain't a problem. The interface of this phone is simply amazing with a lot of customizing options, just love it. VOLUME/POWER BUTTON - A little sharp, but you'll get used to it. So far no cuts on my finger and it will not even cut your finger. SIM CARD SLOT - The pin to open the sim card slot was not provided with this phone. I had to use a paper clip for this. The slot does not open instantly once you insert the pin in the hole. I had to literally force the pin inside and was scared of damaging it, but it finally came out. Just be careful on this one. Verdict - Amazing phone, seriously no complaints. Go for it. If you do have complaints, then you're probably not using it right. Cheers!
0|1|Common a phone supports 4G and cannot fully support 3G? Strange wrong description, it calls for return. Phone does not supports 3G Fully, you cannot make direct 3G network video call. Speaker volume is low. Audio quality is so so.
0|1|i received this device today and there is so much heating problem in this. really disappointed from this device. so much lag in this phone. this phone is not comparable to any any flagship fone. this is zero is front of mi3
1|1|its got Over heated when idle , while calling or in use scared might be explode. burnt like feeling. very poor quality.... not recommend... sound quality is also very poor. not able to hear ringer.. kindly return money. no replacement
1|2|As usual great service by Flipkart, on time delivery. I am using this phone from past 1 day now. I was setting this up with usual stuff like accounts, wifi and sound etc, it started getting heated up. Even 10 mins of subway surfer like games gets this phone to get heated up. Otherwise phone is decent with miui v6, good camera etc. I have mi3 which is pretty solid in this area.
0|1|I HAVE BUY 3 CELL (S1 , S2 & NOW 4IMI) BUT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS CELL THIS IS GETTING VERY HOT AFTER KEEPING IN BOX (IT WAS ON ) ITS BECOME VERY HOT IN 30 MINIUTS (I HAVE PAID RS 13000)FOR THIS HEATER ????????????
0|2|I got the phone today though it is good to look there is problem of overheating when the phone is getting charged or updated.Really disappointed on seeing this just after opening box and charging the phone.Hope they fix this issue.Regret buying this phone.
1|1|don't buy this. overheating issue. buy only if you don't wish to use for calls and just for gaming. otherwise you may damage the ears!!
0|5|I was using Windows phone (Lumia 720) for almost one and half years. Entering into Android platform with this awesome machine is truly an amazing experience. One'll get all the features of a flagship phone ( Be it Samsung, HTC or any other so called "branded" phone). Shedding extra bucks for "brand" is absolutely a waste and I was no exception to this brand phobia until my eyes were opened, thanks to my friends and colleagues who gave honest reviews about these line of phones they owned (Honor, MI, Asus among many) Coming to the negative reviews that were posted here, I can only say- Please be mindful about the money you are spending for the specs given and also note that playing HD games is unfortunately not the function of a smart phone. You have different set of machines to do that. Please don't spoil the ratings (which can deceive a normal user's perception about this awesome phone)
0|4|First of all, This is my 3rd Mi mobile. Configuration- Good- People say it is average as they compare it with high end mobile, Ofcourse you will get good config if you send more money Heating problem- Remember, Phone is a phone- it is neither a SLR camera nor XBox. Let expert do its work. there is no substitute for one another. Would you feel the same confort of the car in BMW bike of the same cost, not for sure the reason is both are meant for a different purpose. same is the case with phone. If you need 3 hour gaming and do not want your phone to heat then go buy XBOX :) Battery- no complaints- as they claim 40% in one hour- Thats pretty fair. Mi Ui is awsum Micromax has long way to catch up with Mi, unless they come up with something innovative. all and all- very good mobile under this price band and definitely a good compition to Sony and samsung.
0|5|The Best in class. Fantastic user interface. Superb speed. Sleek look. Awesome battery back up. Fabulous display clarity. Smooth touch. On the whole this is a very good product at affordable price beats all the other market leaders.
0|1|hi all... I seriously doubt that this phone has corning OGS glass... i bought a new Mi4i few days(40-45 days) back from flipkart... and now this mi 4i with gorilla glass got cracked by a little thumb pressure now touch is not working....and service center told me that it cost rs 12000 phone costing 12999 display costing 12000 my overall experience and review is very bad..plz dont get trapped.. don't buy.. this cheap, fake, Chinese company product..
1|5|I had ordered the phone in the first flash sale itself.Then after reading so many negative reviews i cancelled my phone and started hunting for a new phone.My options was SG S4, and iphone 5C and zenfone 2. My requirements were- 5 inch mobile.(Its the best for one hand operation) Good pixel density screen Good processor/Good graphics processor Good camera(Both primary and secondary) Set back for the SG S4 was the phone was very slow after the lollipop update and the battery charge was also affected drastically.Max you will get 7-8 hours which is not tolerable.Moreover this flagship model was released in 2013 and got 32 bit processor.I considered this because amazon was giving this phone for 16k. Opted out Iphone 5c 8gb because of very less storage space after the ios 8.3 up gradation.You will get only 3.5 gb user space.But there was no report of lags or whatsoever in this phone after updated to latest version.You can consider this one if are ok with limited 3.5gb user space and want to experience the ios.Cosk under 20K. Zenfone 2 (2 gig) is the best competitor for Mi4i.Almost the same performance and screen quality but there are some bugs reported which makes phonecalls dropping/voice quality etc(This may be rectified soon with some OTA udpate).The camera is not as good as Mi4i.Intel processor are notorious for the power consumption.It can hardly last a day. Everyday i am spending some time to read the reviews of above said phones and i came to know that the major cons of the mi4i heating problem is resolved by an update from Xiaomi,so took a chance and brought it. Intial impression about this phone was very bad because the phone started to heat up when i kept it for charging and then i made a call to test its voice quality and it was heating like anything and you cannot put it on ears,that much heat.Then i updated the phone (860MB) and phone really cools down.Now i am not experiencing any heat while charging.But there is some amount of heat developing during call which is tolerable. So my advice is to the prospective buyers please update and use the phone.
1|5|looking very beautify and also looks very slim camera is good video recording is also good screen resolution is very good MiUI 6 is so good mobile performance is also good but little bit heating issue....
1|5|Believe it or not, this phone saved my marriage! I forgot to refill the gas cylinder and my wife was so mad at me that she wanted to leave me right then. But then I played Candy Crush on this phone for 10 minutes and this phone became so hot that I cooked us a sumptuous meal on it. Thanks Mi 4i!
1|1|I got this thru Flipkart on 4th May Order ID OD102724820587653400 and raised a return request also. This is one of the below standard phone from Mi. The biggest problem, While dialing to any number call gets connected or not but the dialer pattern is not visible. I don't know to which number it gets connected. There is no way to disconnect the call as the pattern is invisible. Tried several times as unable to reach MI support.But the same issue. The other biggest issue is heating which I can manage but the display pattern not works may be a fault in the product. The MI4I is below quality I an say compared to other MI
0|3|I have been using this product for 2 days and its the review based of the 2 days of usage 1.Its heats up like anything even for normal Browser usage 2.battery backup is about 1 day 4 hours with Single Sim (2G) and wifi on continuously on single charge,with minimal usage i.e 1 hour youtube,minimal calls and other Social Networking etc. 3.The call clarity is awesome, the sound is clear and crisp,but after making calls for 22 minutes continuously,I felt unusual heating near the earphone thats very irritating. 4.There is bit of Lag in the UI,can't be sensed so easily ( I felt lag while toggling from one app to other) hope Mi would come with an OTA for this 5.At the first Boot I got a Ram of 1Gb from 2GB,but during usage after killing all apps u get something close to 800 mb ram. 6.At the first Boot the internal Storage of the phone was close to 10.6 Gb after removing unnecessary preinstalled apps the memory came up to 11.45 GB (with NO other apps loaded) since there is no Option for memory card you have to keep a Pendrive with you and transfer your clicked photos via OTG. 7.the camera is descent takes good photograph,but there is lot of noise in low light conditions,which will literally spoil the pics,so this phone doesn't perform well in Low light 8.Gaming was just Ok with too much heating,there is something strange in Mi 4i that even the Screen heats up dangerously. 9.The tall claim of Xiaomi as flagship device for India is'nt apparent after using the Phone verdict: If heating and short memory storage is'nt an issue the phone is the best.hope xiaomi will come with an OTA in order to curb the heating issue.
1|1|Phone gets heated usually at the top of screen as well as on the back side. I read few reviews quoting about phone getting heated. Even after updating the phone (which took around 1 hour_internet speed dependent), the heating problem persists. Though the phone is packed with great features & ergonomic design, but this problem can't be overlooked. Would like to request all future buyers not to buy Mi 4i, until this problem gets officially addressed by Xiomi.
0|3|The phone performance is very nice and good camera but there is a heating problem in this phone. Quality of the phone is good , its handy and good to use.
0|4|Here is what you need to know about the phone before you purchase: The good: 1. Amazing display with display calibration and color gamut found in Apple Hardware. The sunlight readability works as advertised. 2. Well built with anti-slip matte back and very light weight. Easy to hold and won't drop too often unless you are butter-fingered 3. 'Flagship-grade' rear camera with quick focus, good HDR mode and great details and colors. Decent front cam, gets the job done but don't expect much detail in the picture 4. Good battery life. Lasts a typical work day with about 20% battery left. Obviously depends on usage pattern. For better battery life, keep the phone in balanced performance mode and 40-50% brightness set on Auto 5. Did I say, gorgeous display ;) The bad: 1. Performance is middling at best and doesn't deserve a 'flagship' rating. App launches are slow, sometimes won't happen at all. Signs of an unoptimised OS running on decent hardware. Expect a Day 0 software update of 800 mb+ which is a must-have else the phone overheats and performance stays sluggish. There is an update in the works which should fix most of the issues though. 2. Battery life could have been better. A problem possibly because of Lollipop 5.0.2. An update to 5.1 is needed to remove memory leak and battery life problems which should happen soon enough. 3. The balanced mode takes the life out of this phone. Multitasking is a pain, app launches slow down further and you can notice the stutter in animations. 4. Continuous camera usage can overheat the phone to the point that the camera app starts to lag a lot and the focus struggles. You will have to let the phone cool down to go back to smooth performance. 5. Severe CPU throttling when phone heats. Don't know if its the OS or the Snapdragon 615 problem. We will know after the Software update for sure. 6. 16 GB non-expandable storage with about 11GB of user available memory. If you keep a lot of media or love to take pictures, you might wanna wait for the 32/64gb one 7. The OS uses a lot of RAM. 1.5Gb out of 2 is usually taken by MIUI. This is not a deal breaker but definitely a drain on performance and battery life. Lots of other bugs which need a fix. 8. Only white option. If you've got to give only 1 option, make it black. seriously. NOTE to Buyers: If you see a lot of heating in general use or a light bleed below the backlit buttons, ask for a replacement right away. The heating problem is mitigated by the update so do that before you ask for replacement. The light bleed problem is due to poor panel lamination and replacement is the only option.
0|2|i got my 3 rd Mi in 1st online selling.as it say it has 16 gb internal memory bt i got 10 gb only.data connection frusted toooooooo much.it leaves net connection most of tym. my review is based on 4 days uses....
0|2|brought this last week.. not that happy with the phone .. claims faster battery charging.. i dont think thats happening next 64 bit octa core processor --- had tough time playing real racing game.. network issues. doesnt let me download .. need to submit it multiple times. only good thing i see is look and light weight. lot more has to be done to bring it on par with others phones.
0|3|I received Phone on 4th may. Faced Heating issues while setup. Also it is mentioned in the specifications that User Memory is 12.77GB, but on my phone it is 9.6GB. I am not clear on this. Otherwise phone is worth the price.
0|4|Dear all, I have handled Mi 4i over two days. Let me explain in detail about the phone. Pros: 1. Very sharp display quality without any spike/lag 2. Very slim and sturdy. Extremely light weight. 3. Good camera both rear and front with added editing features 4. Very good touch & light response. MIUI 6 awesome and super-fast. 5. Fast browsing experience 6. Clear audio 7. Faster WiFi & network capturing 8. Multiple key boards including Hindi, Bengali, Telugu and Tamil 9. Got 4G download speeds upto 1.8 MBPS (Airtel Postpaid- Bangalore). Cons: 1. 10 GB free space for Apps only 2. No gesture control 3. Does not come with added accessories like earphones and scratch guard 4. Battery lasted one day only on Wi-Fi (moderate usage). 5. Low RAM availability (900MB-1GB max even after closing all apps) 6. Not very sure if it comes with Gorilla Glass (doesn't seem like it though) Many people say it has heating issues. Well I tested the phone by playing "Asphalt 8" in full graphics. It does tend to heat up slightly after playing for an hour, but which phone wouldn't? It is certainly not an area of concern. Please update the MIUI version as soon as you receive the phone (800 MB download) and you will not get any heating problems. I expected better results from the battery, and wish it was available in 64 GB version. Other than that, even without the earphones and scratch-guard, this is definitely the best buy of this season at this price.
0|5|Hai.. I bought this mobile for my sister.. This is her first smartphone.. The phone Was delivered in good packin. Talking about the phone, the phone has a good built quality. It is very easy to hold and also u can use one hand option in the settings. Perfect size for girls.. The 1st thing when u notice after booting is the display quality. It is not notch and is right up their with iphones. Vibrant crisp and clear! sharp has done a great job. The response from the phone pretty good and after the update even small lags went.. It is easy to use and u will like it.. Lots of customization options available.. The phone weighs light u don't even feel it. Talking about the camera it is very good indeed. Photos taken under adequate light turned out to be rich in detail. Colours are natural.. It is the best camera at this price I have ever seen so far.. Front camera too. I bought this phone just for two reasons one is camera and other is display quality and siz. I am nother at all disappointed. Talking about the performance it does a great job in handling apps. But I don't know why my FB messenger not opening. It just shows a white screen whenever I opened it. Other apps performed well. My sister is not a gamer like me. I use Sony Xperia Z ultra and it handles games exceptionally well. But I tried small games that my sis might play like subway surfers and temple run. Both played very well in performance mode. I felt slight heating at the top but not a deal breaker Infact u would feel the same amount of in other ddevices. I saw in YouTube that the device crossed 50C while playing FPS games like Nova 3 but anyway my sis is not gonna play while I do everyday. Audio quality is good and get good pair headphones from Sony or other OEM. I like the quick charge and it does work well. Moderate users can get a day eeasily. At times it looks like Iphone which is kinda cool. I bought after lot research and I made a right choice. 1 con people would say is the lack of expandable storage but she has a laptop and also the mobile has OTG support so no problem.. I won't rate it 5 out 5 if I bought this from me because I am gamer and this device can't handle crunch situation but it does a good job for my sis. The game can handle heavy games but the problem is heating U won't see any drop frames while playing Asphalt 8 and Modern combat in performance mode but Nova 3 lags. So there u go a good device for this money. I would recommend this for moderate gamers. But if u r not a heavy gamer then u can register it now..
0|4|excellent phone. loving it. screen and camera is brilliant. solid value for money.build quality is good. the phone is very light and easy to manage the screen controls with one hand.ui is friendly and the phone is not cluttered with too many pre loaded apps.the battery life is excellent.

1|1|I purchased Mi 4i from flipkart, which was delivered on 3rd may. I found following faults in the mobile: 1. Voice distortion, call not properly audiable. 2. It takes 10 hours for full charging, which is against promise of fast charging. 3. Battery drains fast. Lasts in 8 hours with normal use. I requested flipkart for return but they outrightly refused. Feeling cheated. Please don't buy this mobile.
0|5|Few days back on 15 july i order this phone. the phone i received was heating so much that one can iron the clothes with that i contact flipkart they said update it... i do... then the issue was not solved... last week i request for replacement nd flipkart rejected my request. I again try then after a lot of talk they replace the phone. Now the main twist... the replacement i got is a Mi4i in which the touch screen is not working... when i complaint they said call later... again i try they again assign a call for today i.e 6 august 15. The customer care disconnect the call nd message me tht they will call me tomorrow.... Flipkart Just passing the time so tht 30 days just fly away... nd i left with a damaged phone. I m very disappointed with this behaviour. I thought Flipkart is good. but i was completely wrong.. Recently purchased 4 phones from flipkart to gift my family... But now i will never recommend flipkart to anyone. Shame on u flipkart. I dnt want to use that phone anymore. Plz refund my money. I am rating 5 star for the brilliant Idea of cheating the customers. Brilluiant job Flipkart for fooling customers.
1|1|Imagine a situation where u have a delicious dish in front of u but can't eat it even knowing that its going to taste awesome just because its too hot to eat..something similar had happened to me with this Mi4i..all specs performance was great..the display the camera the overall touch experience and the built quality with a slim design its really brilliant..overall it do seems a very expensive phone..also the battery life was really good with the fact that it has an octacore processor and a full hd display...And the miui over android gives a very much an iOS like experience which is also really great..but with so many great things and pros there is just one major cons which surpasses all pros is that the heating issue.. yes i can understand any smartphones do get heated up a lot when u do heavy tasks like gaming continuously for 15-20 mins but with very casual uses like doing Facebook and net browsing just for 2-3 mins if gets heated up that too so much that u can't even place the phone in our ears for taking calls and have to depend upon earphones or loud speakers , that is really intolerable even for a great phone like this..and i have been using the phone in an ac room..although xiaomi has given a few updates on miui which demands it solves this heating issues but believe me it doesn't do things any different at all.. When I first reported this problem to Flipkart they did provide me a replacement but that new one had the same issues as well.. infact the new one along with the heating issues has various other small issues like light sensors not working, wifi was not working properly..so after that being really irritated i called Flipkart and this time I requested to give my refund as I had enough with this phone..and i must thanks to Flipkart's customer care guys who really helped me a lot and agreed to give my refund..so thumbs up to Flipkart's service which did provide my refund within less than 24hrs of making the request.. But I really wish I could keep as I said within 13k its really impossible to get a phone as brilliant as this .. So finally i would recommend who ever planning to buy this purchase this only if u r leaving in a place where the temperature is at sub zero level :D
1|1|1. HEATING HEATING HEATING!! Firstly heats up during charging up to 40 degree and browsing 42 degeree. Then Just try and change themes or browse internet for a while and your phone feels like its suffering from high fever and it goes up to 45 degrees . Then play games for a while and you can make water warm and milk if it is water proof. If you still want to push it, go ahead and try to make a call and stay on it for 20 min, you will have to get medication for ear burns! 2. MIUI - A SPACE HOG After installing the latest updates i am left with only 10 GB of space. I have not installed any apps from play store than what came along with the phone. With no expandable memory this is quite an issue. 3. LAG - SOMETIMES Even switching home screens lags sometimes. My old 512 mb ram powered android ics mobile was better when it was new in playing games of its time. Subway surfers starts lagging after just 15 min of gameplay. Now 2 GB of RAM and a 64 bit 2nd gen octacore and then lag, c'mon who are we kidding here! 4. LOW VOLUME ON EXTERNAL SPEAKER Go to a noisy indian market and i assure you that you will miss a call coz you could not hear it. 5. 13 MP BACK CAMERA - produces blurry images in moderate lighting. Its good in very bright lighting though. Bottom line: I could have bought a yureka (almost same specs but larger screen) for a far lesser price, but since i wanted a screen not more than 5 inch, i bought this. I don't mind spending extra money but do not want heat generating hand warmer. I live in south india, NOT kashmir.
0|2|Phone is getting heated up very soon. Can't be in a call for more than 3 minutes or can't play games or watch videos in you tube. measured heat was 48'C
0|1|For the first time i am feeling cheated by Flipkart. The phone I got has several problems. First its sound output is very low. Secondly the phone gets heated very quickly. The battery drains very fast.
0|1|Please do not waste your money on buying this phone. The sound quality is pathetic. Even at the maximum sound, you would miss calls. Its that bad. I have been told by Flipkart that they cant be bothered, as Xiaomi is at fault. Its really a sad situation to be in.
0|1|I have a problem with my mi4i which is having front camera problem when iam taking a picture with my front camera the screen will get faded with small colored particles, and the clicked picture has the same small colored paticles faded.is anyone facing the same problem?
0|1|Don't Buy This Phone. They are totally doing fraud with customer. I bought MI4i Cell phone. Phone is heating lot. Ring volume very low. Also Big problem in screen. Whenever I dial the call screen goes totally blank. I can not disconnect the call in between. I complaint to flipkart first they told me Seller is not replace your product. Now I complaint with MI company service center. They are also not answering properly. Now they are telling me to go our service center & service center number is also not working. They don't have it's alternet number. Very worst situation. My money it's totally waste.
1|1|I received the phone about 3 days ago but neither the phone speaker nor the SIM was bieng detected. Even after filing a return, it has been only been one contact in which they asked me to download an app for the diagnostics but never told me what to download and after that there is no contact from them. I have been buying from Flipkart for a long time but their service has really degraded quite a bit in recent times. Edit: If you give a time for callback either follow it to point or don't give some stupid reason like this is not a dialer or we can not call you back in 10 min or so.(Gave me callback time for 1:30pm and called at 1:00pm when I was eating my lunch and said couldn't callback at assigned time and will allot me a new time on the next day) People have work to do. I even adjusted my according to your callback time and then you give me this stupid reason. Whats more this is the third callback time that you gave me after my first one in which you asked to download an app which you would send a link for and never send it till this date. Also, who gives the time for callback during lunch hours and expect the person to not his food. If you don't want to replace the item, just say so, don't waste people's time. I will arrange some other way to get my return. I am not sure if I would buy anything from Flipkart after such an incident. I have to ask people to be careful of such incidents happening to them. Edit 2: I have not been contacted till now after the initial contact and was given a new timing for fourth time and then suddenly out of the blue, my return request status has been updated as resolved. WOW..... FLIPKART invented a new technique to resolve a hardware defect without even a single contact.. Someone give them a NOBEL Prize for such an achievement... It would save millions...no....billions of dollars worth of material and time...
0|1|Going by the advertisement Mi4i is just a pathetic mobile phone in terms of Gaming & Camera usage. Mobile is good for making calls...but battery is pathetic for user making more than 50 calls and using Whatsapp & Google Masps. If u are a gamer then U jus did the greatest mistake of ur life by buying this mobile. As I played Need for Speed for 30 mins....it was unable for me to hold the mobile temp was 55 degree Celcius. Try dis *#*#4636#*#* and check for battery temp. I'm really fed up with this mobile...within less than a month, the mobile is hanging and heating up like anything. Plz Plz dont buy this phone. Moto G2 is the best option. Dont go for this pathetic piece of shit...
0|1|I bought my first Xioami Phone , Some of my friends are already using Xioami and all of them have good feedbacks about the phone. As soon as i unpacked the phone, I found that its touch keypad is not working properly Key "S" and Key "Z" are not getting pressed, The particular area of the screen is not recognizing the touch.... I was very shocked with the build quality of Xioami Phones. Flipkart is sending a replacement I will get back with more reviews once I receive the replacement and use it for some days...
0|1|this is total waste of money.............. this phone is nothing but cheating with customers. I have bought this phone last week itself android apps are not working. over heating problem is there..... it become terribly hot when talk over the phone for just 10 or more minutes...... NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT GET ACTIVATED....... WHATSUP IS ALSO NOT GETTING CONNECTED WITH THE PHONE MEMORY...... I AM VERY MUCH FRUSTRATED....... so my humble request is DONT BUY THIS PHONE. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
0|1|Mi 4i is a really poor phone, As soon as i put in a request for refund with your site, I got a message ti install some app from visiting a link and even with H+ sign on my 3 G network, I kept trying from last 5 hours now and this app is not installing but it's not an app issue, its rather phone connectivity issue that even with H+ sign i can't sync my facebook account too which i have enabled to work on data, same is the condition with Watsapp, I m highly dissatisfied with the performance and want my money to be returned. Apart from this, I have complaints with the speaker quality, over heated issue and 3 G connectivity is a major issue. And i am surprised with Flipkart return policy now, even they know its a bad product still coming up with new tricks of downloading app to return product so that people who lask time should skip one month and they dont have to bother about user complaints. Really disappointed from Flipkart services. Although I am a regular buyer of mobile devices from Flipkart and have bought all modles of xiaomi by now. Expecting a call back soon. If you really care about user experience and feedback
0|4|Has anybody received an 800MB+ update to MIUI?? I applied the update as soon as unboxing the Mobile. The mobile then went into a Reboot over-drive. It started rebooting every now and then while its opening Whatsapp or Camera usage or Settings menu etc. Have to call and file for a exchange. Did anyone else face a similar issue? Do report it here. The mobile is nice by the way. For the price this is easily the best compact 5inch mobile u can buy with acceptable performance, camera and battery life.
1|2|Flipkart has replaced my phone. After replacement n update it is working fine(nominal heating i.e. 42 C on gaming). Some lags are there while gaming on balanced mode. Can play full HD without lags. Nominal heating is expected by octa-core fanless processer while processing demanding applications. I got this mobile in its first flash sale. A review after 1 week usage 1. Display is very crisp n clear. 2. Camera is good in good lightening conditions. 3. Call quality is good though earpiece needs little more volume. 4. Battery has heating issues while charging, sometimes for no reasons, on gaming also. Here heating means heating above a normal threshold. 5. Compact design and sleek phone. 6. Lollipop is good and performance is also good. This is my first Xiomi and I am disappointed. Reviewer please do give honest reviews about a product. I have asked for return lets see if Flipkart processes is or not.
0|4|looks beautiful awesome camera full HD video recording awesome Front camera awesome no lags Full HD Screen Beautiful UI interface But Little Bit of heating issues but not my problem 6 against 1 i don't Care i mean which phone does not have a heating issues so i'm gonna give it 5 stars
0|5|Purchased this mobile during the Big Billion Day sale and although Flipkart took ages to deliver this, the wait was worth every paisa. Before buying this device, I read tons of review and how it became hot even after slight usage. To all of those people, my simple advice is update the device!!! As soon as I turned on the mobile, there was a 860 mb update waiting for me. I decided to test out something and delayed that update. Installed Asphalt 8, Nova and it did get heated up quite a lot after playing for 5 minutes. After installing the update, the heating simply went away. The only con for me was the 16 Gb storage which can somehow be circumvented by OTG. The sound was really low and I suspected a software issue; so I updated to miui7 developer rom. That way there are no more issues with sound anymore. As far the rest of the device goes, it is simply superb! Go for it!
1|2|If we talk about the phone camera, interface, themes, user easiness, no lag etc then its an amazing phone in this segment. Main Problem 1. Heating with minor multi use. 2. Withe every system update you get camera lag issue or touch not working or phone hangs during call for 10-15 second 3. major apps some function do not work, example- whatsapp voice notes do not work. i am amazed by the flipkart service though, they send a link to me by which i downloaded the app and by that app flipkart checked my phone and then eventually when they found issues they refunded me. Hatss Off service by flipkart.
0|5|Using the Mi4i White(16GB) since a week. BODY: I jus love the way it looks. very LIGHT-WEIGHT, SLEEK and SLIM. All my friends were surprised after holding the phone which weighed so less. And you needn't worry about the smudges on the pure white back as its ANTI-GREASE COATED which means you can just wipe off the smudges with a cloth or eraser or sometimes even your hand. I personally tested this. It works great. If you worried about durability, you can check out the stress test videos of MI4I on youtube. DISPLAY: You just cant get a better display than this. So vibrant and crisp. Sunlight Display is Awesome. Touch is too good. I heard many people saying there is no Gorilla Glass Protection. I would say they are WRONG. Go check out the video 'Xiaomi Mi 4I Tear Down by Hugo Barra' on Youtube. (Hugo Barra is the Vice President of Xiaomi). He clearly says that the glass is made specially by Corning and is equivalent to Gorilla Glass 3 in its characteristics. UI : One Word... Superb. Looks almost similar to that of I-Phone and is really smooth. Phone initially comes with 6.5.5 which is kinda snappier but now upgraded to 6.7.1 which is the latest release and now the UI is smooth as butter even in balanced performance mode. Update brought many cool features and settings which gives us a lot of customizability to the UI. Active community where you can post your feedback and get their replies. One more cool thing is we can flash any MIUI version with the inbuilt updater app. Just download the version you want to install and copy it into the phone and flash it using the updater app. MiPhone Manager software is also available to provide even more features like Casting screen to System without wifi. CAMERA: I BOUGHT THIS PHONE MAINLY FOR THE CAMERAS. The best in the price point or may be even beyond it. Both the cameras do a FANTASTIC job. Daylight photos are just Amazing. The amount of detail it captures really surprised me when I compared it with models in the similar price range like Moto G 3rd Gen. Pictures are way better. You can compare the photo quality in www.gsmarena.com . BATTERY: REALLY GOOD. Lasted for 1day 10 hours 20min, which included screen-on time of 5hours 40 minutes, 44Min of voice calls, 10hours of wifi for WhatsApp,Gmail and Google Drive. Charging is quite fast too. CONNECTIVITY: Connectivity is way better than my old phone(Samsung Galaxy Fame). Signal Reception is quite good and there are no call drops which were very frequent on my old phone as I stay in the outskirts of the city. Latest WIFI and Bluetooth Protocols. I heard many people complaining about heating and low sound but those issues are RESOLVED with MIUI updates. Now the speaker is loud enough and heating reduced quite significantly. The only problem people might face could be the lack of Extendable memory slot which I think may not be an issue if you carry an OTG cable. Just copy the things which you feel aren't that necessary into the Hard-Disk or pen drive with the OTG cable and you are good to go. (Watch the tear-down video for reasons why they dint provide the External SD Card Slot) I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANY PERSON.
0|1|Purchased this phone during a flash sale on the mi India website, on June 30, 2015. Phone was delivered 14 days from date of order. Follow-ups with customer care were a nightmarish experience. Standard response of 'Phone will be delivered in next two days' was given. No visibility of where the device was or how long it would really take for delivery was shared. Company has a 10-day replacement policy and in 15 days time the navigation keys set failed completely. Service Centre wouldn't accept the phone for repair as IMEI number on the invoice did not match with IMEI on the phone. Call to Customer Service for updating the invoice, needs picture of packaging box, screenshot of the phone and invoice. Several (~8) follow-ups later, no resolution. From follow-up 4-7, I was assured that phone would be replaced, the issue is escalated and a call-back should be expected. Mails to the company are never acknowledged. Follow-up 8, the 'Solution Expert' can't find the ticket number shared with me, cannot see the attachments in my mail which were verbally acknowledged during previous follow-ups and asks me to visit the Service Centre and connect the mi team with Service Centre personnel over call. Updated invoice will not be shared. Phone will not be replaced. Complete nightmare dealing with their solution experts as problem needs restating EVERY single time. Do NOT buy Xiaomi!! Instead purchase a Samsung or even a Micromax.
1|4|I using this phone from last 3 months. During charging phone get heated up to 40 degrees. And while playing games it heated up to 50 degrees. It burned my fingers. Battery backup during continues use is stand up to 4 hours only. It had 2GB ram, but don't run smoothly. After all its made in China.

0|5|Edited after two weeks use I'm not writing a review but recommending this phone to everyone who wish for an iPhone 6 but can't buy it. This phone is better in most ways, than the iPhone 6. Including the screen size, resolution, camera quality, battery life and speed of apps like camera, email, and all productive apps. Only that iPhone is metal look and this is plastic look. But it doesn't look cheap at all. The back is matte finish (high quality polycarbonate) so smooth and can easily be used with one hand. Pros? 1) Screen resolution, colors and sunlight brightness – Awesome 2) A) Battery life – for clicking photos, checking emails, whatsapp, reading news, few calls and showing off phone to colleagues, it easily lasts a day. - Awesome 2) B) Exact timing? If your screen is continuously on with 3g connected and chatting, browsing then every 5 minutes 1 percent down. That is around 10 – 12 percent down for an hour, which comes to around / approx. 10 hours of screen on time – Awesome. You will get tired, viewing the phone so much time per day. It is not good for your health. 3) Camera – Best Camera you can get for the price. It’s simply awesome in daylight, because of true color reproduction. Indoor too it’s very good. So many options, like with flash, HDR, HDR live, or continuous flash on, for better lighting of photos. A small tip- In out doors just keep your subject less than a meter close to the mobile and give 3-1 space in the frame for the background and you get DSLR effect with background blurred. Awesome – You don’t need a cam for emergency; this is always there with you. One more tip – Actually the original settings of camera is normal. You have to press the menu button and in the settings increase it to “high quality”. There are so many settings as you like to increase quality of photos. Maybe that’s why people who have not done this say camera is average. 4) Front cam – beautifies you. Really makes you look younger. Good enough. 5) Apps open real fast, if you can go to developer mode and increase the speed of animator by .5x its really fast. You won’t feel the lag in opening apps. You can Google “developer options for MIUI.” There are plenty of options to better your phone 6) Security App of MIUI – Awesome. You don’t need any third party software to maintain your phone to make it run smoothly. Yes, with so many options. No need of battery guru, antivirus, speed booster etc. 7) The phone itself is lightweight and durable. It is the best combination for a phone. If you compare price to product ratio, then only 25000 rupees above phones can come near this. That is really awesome. Cons? 1) I haven’t installed any games since I don't want to waste time. Maybe it heats up while gaming, but I don’t care. For me it is a perfect device. 2) The speaker is not loud, but it is ok. And I mostly use headphones to hear songs or watch movies, which is awesome. After all however loud the speaker is you cannot enjoy the full spectrum of music unless you have a headphone. Basically the call related loudspeaker is loud enough. 3) No SD card... But for me every week all the photos and videos get uploaded to Google and I free up the space keeping only the best ones in mobile. Moreover it has OTG so you can copy any movies etc. from pen drive and watch if that’s important to you. But since its just 16 GB it’s quite fast in working. And I recommend this to whoever wants a high quality and productive mobile, which includes awesome call quality and functions, high quality camera, official and personal emails, whatsapp, internet banking apps, documents and power point creations etc, etc... Also I liked was converting a word doc into pdf. and reading in mobile mode. Awesome. There is so much we can talk about the phone, but this is it. Don't miss such a masterpiece by looking at unnecessary negative reviews. There is no perfect phone in this world. And this phone is full of awesomeness and very less of cons. So go for it. Peace
0|3|If it continues heating it up..i am contemplating returning it. Good features but of what use when you can use it for 10 min? MI knows that heat is their Nemesis still it has not improved on it.. despite good feature and value for money i am not going to recommend anyone because of heat issue..
1|4|Been using it for the last one week. Got it in the 1st flash sale. Here are my reviews: Pros: 1. Crisp and bright display. Looks gr8 in sunlight as well 2. Gr8 camera - works perfect in daylight but a bit disappointing in night mode 3. Superb looks - sleek uni body and one hand use makes it feel rich. Cons: 1. MIUI is bit unfriendly for new users.. It will take you some time to get used to it. 2. App crashes made me disappoint - Gallery with Slide show crashed for me once and Data Usage app never launches! 3. Chinese text usage is some widgets and alerts - Learn Chinese before using this phone. I hope the new updates fix some of these. Don't worry about the battery heating - if its running - its got to be sweating! :) All phones have heating issues. This is no different. My brother got an ASUS Zenphone 2 (12999) at the same time and when compared - both gadgets have their good and bad. If you are looking for light weight - one hand use - happy with 16 g internal without an external memory - go for MI4i. If you need big display - better battery (asus has an ultra-saving battery mode that lasts the phone for up to 2 days) - regular android UI experience - go for ASUS
0|3|This phone has got an amazing screen,perfect weight and good battery life.But,if the phone gets heated up,then the problem starts.The CPU is throttled down,and it affects the performance ( Try taking some photos in quick succession outdoors,or use Messenger),you can feel the lag.The software update we get on first boot does no fixes this (I don't think it was meant to fix). Hope Xiaomi releases a software update soon.
0|3|Look & Feel :Excellent Display :Excellent it heats up when play games and use internet over wi-fi other things are working good. call quality is very good. But im facing problem of volume getting decreases automatically while playing songs,video,s or playing game .after then i have to close that and again start then volume comes loud but after 10 sec it again goes down.hence I am thinking to replace it or refund .
0|1|3100+ battery & 5inch phone combination would make every one realize wud give the best battery back up .. I would say 9hours of average usage . Heating issues obeserved even without playing games just browsing itself one could feel phone gets warmer. Mui6 software is good but not as smooth as other Custom OS like cynogenmod . What s good about phone : Screen quality, Overall build , and 5inch size. Could have provided sd card support .10gb of free space is very less.
0|5|I'm writing this after a day of usage. Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. This phone is the BEST in terms of style, performance, battery and camera. Display of this phone, OMG, it's beyond any words. AWESOME ! Absolutely light and can't feel that you are carrying it, at first place. Nice design, made for human hands. The device heats up a bit, but there are no phones in market that doesn't heat up and also I heard the heating issue is resolved in the immediate OTA update which pops up as soon as you switch on for the first time (~800 MB), which I haven't done so far. MIUI is so fluidic in every nature. This is my first Mi / Xiaomi device and it's way beyond expectations atleast after a day of usage. Pros: Awesome display Fluidic MIUI Excellent Camera (both front / back) No lag Superb call quality Cost effective Great battery Cons: Average volume (Not too loud) **************************************************************************************************** It's steal at this price band. Awesome phone, you can go for it !! ****************************************************************************************************
0|3|a v.good piece for this price tag, ill give my ratings as follows out of 5.. model/design: 4/5 screen: 4.5/5 camera: 3/5 ui: 4/5 battery backup :4/5 coming to ram it has 2 gb in which the whole 1 gb is used for pre installed apps well we can uninstall them tough. processor speed is good, well according to the price. we cant expect speed as compared to 2+ghz devices. for the first time when i turned on the device got heated up within moments but after that its normal not much heating update the software there is a software available. am pretty disappointed when i opened the box no headset no otg cable, jus device and charger that's all very disappointing... my overall score for this device is 3/5. i would have given at-least 4.5 if other accessories were given.
0|3|i writing this after 24 hrs of usage. cons: memory only 10.5gb available UI is not so great There is some lagging noticeable takes a lot of time to wake up (screen to switch on)when pressed power button button quality i didn't like 1gb available ram only white available in flash sale(this white doesn't give rich look). Think of all alternatives before you buy , since its not a Steal like that of Mi3. There are some pro's Display is cool heat is very less(I don't understand why so many people have heating problem. ) camera is good. back panel quality is good very light perfect size
0|2|I bought this phone for my wife as a gift to her. I was impressed with the tech specs. On paper, this phone looked really very good. I personally use an iPhone 6 Plus and a Google Nexus 5. On the basis of those technical specifications, I went ahead and bought this phone. I must say this phone is a pretty cheap phone with below average performance. In just over 3 days, phone started freezing. My wife is not tech savvy, so she had in total 6-7 apps installed for basic use. Phone freezed, got heated and the overall performance was very sluggish. On loud speaker, you could barely hear what the person on the opposite end is speaking. Speaker volume and overall volume, is extremely low. I have asked for a replacement. I wanted a refund, but I guess, I don't have an option. So, my money is dumped and wasted. My advice to you guys: Don't go on price tags and on paper specifications. Go for tried and trusted brands. I have lost my money in this phone, you be careful!
0|4|MI4i seems to be awesome mobile but with certain cons. Display is awesome Mi has surely done a good job. Sunlight visibility is good, but the sunlight feature what they described works only when you put torch light on the light sensor. with normal sunlight there seems to be no change in the display. performance is too good (change the default settings to "performance mode" which will be in "balanced mode" in default to increase the device performance and speed). no heavy heating issue even with heavy games, except during charging the mobile, compared to the other mobiles having 615soc. speaker sound is good. no problem with internet/network connectivity even while travelling in car/bus. Battery charges very fast thanks to the fast charging adaptor. camera is good in bright day light, but very very poor in low or dim light. seems like 6-8mp camera. if camera is your preference then mi4i is not ur choice. battery drains like anything. it comes only for 7-8hrs of normal usage. and 5-6hrs with heavy usage. overall mi4i is a good choice if camera and battery back up is not ur priority.
1|1|Over heating while charging and using 3G. Processing speed very low and hanging. Requested for return. Flipkart must confirm the quality of the product before they selling new products, i m totally disappointed with this.
0|1|The phone's screen is too delicate. It fell from the mattress which is 2 inch in height, on a mat, the screen cracked and the touch stopped working. The flipkart person said he's helpless.
0|5|Do not think .. Just go for it ... ! I have received Mi 4i three days ago, After using the phone for three days i have decided to write review about this phone, Now coming over to the main part that is the pros and cons that would help you to understand better : Pros: * Excellent User-Interface , Xiomi has worked hard to carve out an amazing interface for this android phone. *PPI of 441 offers excellent viewing display at par with high end samsung mobiles when it comes to display quality. * Gorilla Glass screen - something that you get only in top notch devices. It offers scratch resistant and very smooth smudge resistant screen. *Dual sim - it is a dual sim phone - supports micro sim * Call quality is very crisp and clear because it has an active noise cancellation mic. *Wi-Fi , GSM /WCDMA/3G/ GPS connectivity is very good. * Camera - .. it has a very good camera . Primary camera is of 13 mp , while the secondary camera is of 5 mp and comes with a beautify feature will surely be liked by selfie lovers. There are a lot of modes for the camera tha can be handy. Picture quality can be compared to Nokia or Samsung high end phones. * Excellent battery backup with 3120 mah bettery Cons : * Day 1 after using the phone for 3-4 hours i obseved phone started heating However since i updated the the Mi Phone version to Mi 6 heating problem seems to be resoved. * Phone does't have any external memory card slot which is biggest drawback of this phone because out of 16 Gb of internal memory only 12 Gb is availabe for users which seems to be very less. *sound of the loudspeaker is not too loud, i would say overall its an excellent phone under 15000 by Xiomi. Just go for it without any thoughts. Heating problem will be resolved once you update the phone application for Sure :)
0|4|I must say this is one of those product, where a person is on a crossroad seeing Performance, Quality and Monetary satisfaction together. But before i move towards pros and cons of Mi 4i, i have being reading a lot about the heating issues from my other fellow users. The simple step to AVOID OVER-HEATING is to UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM to latest version. That's it. To do this, click settings < about phone < system updates. (make sure your are connected to a decent internet connection because you will be required to download a 806mb update) Before updating, the phone used to get heated within minutes of normal usage but now its running smoothly without giving me a tan. After updating i have been using this phone for 2 hours on a stretch, that too with wifi on, and I didn't find any over-heating issues. So before you start doing experiments with Mi 4i camera and other stuffs, make sure you have updated your Mi 4i system first. But still, a little Heads-Up from Xiaomi would have been better in this regard. Now the, Pros: 1)Excellent Display screen (finally i can see in bright sunlight what on earth am i clicking) 2)Strong Wifi receiver when you compare it with other phones (even the high end ones) 3)No useless bloatwares 4)Yes outer body is made of plastic but its nowhere near to being labeled as cheap. In-fact its very good, look-wise and the feel. 5)The best part are its touch and user interface. Smooth and lag free. Cons: 1)Average speaker 2)Power and Volume Button could have been more sturdy 3)Heating issues prior to System update(Yes, this nuisance went away after update) 4)Only 10.83 GB available to users out of 16 GB(Considering there is no slot for SD card) Everything has two sides to it and overall am very satisfied with this product.
0|5|have been using it since 3 days and it is simply amazing. everything works just superbly and yes I know I am using a lot of big words but trust me, this phone is actually just too good for the price tag. I definitely recommend it.
0|4|Issue: Just received shipment of the new Mi4i - the phone seems to have a light leakage/bleeding below the buttons and the bezel egde. This is visible in dark room conditions when you press the buttons and the backlight for the button is on. I have seen an Mi4i forum where many other users have faced the same issue. This seems like a generic build quality issue. The users were given replacement devices but some of them faced the same issue with the replaced device as well. I have requested for a replacement. Now hoping that Mi/Flipkart will get my Mi4i phone replaced with a quality replacement product at the first go. Will update my review on the product once/if I get a quality replacement device. Update 1: Called up Flipkart and they immediately agreed to send out a replacement. Currently in the process of getting the phone couriered back to them. They would refund the courier charges later on once I send a scanned copy of the bill. So far so good. Rating still at 1 until I get the new replacement device and check it. Update 2: Couriered my mobile back to flipkart and sent them a scanned copy of the courier charges as well. The original email they sent mentioned: "We also request you to email the scanned copy of receipt along with the tracking id, so that we can reimburse the courier charges in actuals." The same was also communicated by the customer care executive I spoke to. But the response I got from them on sending the courier charges was: "The courier charges will be reimbursed as promotional wallet balance to your Flipkart account. You’ll receive an automated e-mail as soon as this is credited. You can use your wallet balance, having unlimited validity, as a prepaid mode of payment for your future orders for the products sold by WS Retail on our website." Reimburse the courier charges in actual and giving a wallet balance are totally two different things. Giving me a wallet balance for products purchased from WS retail forces me to buy further products from them which I am not interested in after this experience. This is a forced promotion of the selected retailer. The courier charges is not an amount I would die for but false promises and misleading statements in this world where consumers have rights is absolutely not acceptable. Please do not accept to courier the defective items to flipkart, instead ask them to come collect it themselves. Update 3: I have now received the replacement device. Flipkart initiated sending of the replacement device as soon as they received my courier with the defective handset. Pretty good there. Now in the process of testing the Mi4i phone as I feel XIAOMI would not have. Have an email chain going on with Mi4i india team and I must say their response is pathetic. They do not even have a database of the issues that led to replacement requests for the Mi4i phones. So basically they seem to be following the concept of getting the devices in the market, getting it tested by the users and then fixing the problems for perhaps their next phone. How unprofessional is not even maintaining a list of customer reported issues so that they can prevent it from affecting other users. Also Flipkart has promised to reimburse the courier charges back to my bank account instead of the wallet. Need to check if that happens. Rating still at 1 until all is sorted. Update 4: Flipkart has now credited the courier charges back into my account. Had to do a bit of follow up but still appreciate the fact that I could get it done without picking up the phone. Really appreciate that so would give a 4 start rating to Flipkart on that. The new replacement phone seems to be working fine. Have done a bit a testing in the past few days. However Xiaomi has not replied to my queries yet which is highly irritating. Below arethe question I asked. 1) How did I end up getting a defective device ? (it's not a one off case, if that's your argument, as I have now come to know many many people getting similar defective pieces.) 2) When I get a replacement device I would like to know how it is being ensured by Xiaomi that I do not get a defective device again (have read in forums people facing same issue with replacement devices as well). 3) What are the checks I need to do before fully accepting the device ? (Am sure you would have a database of issues people have reported which lead to replacement requests) 4) Please send me a list of known issues and a check list so that I can ensure that I have AT LEAST this time received a quality device So at the moment rating would slightly increase to 2 but still not satisfied on account of responses from Xiaomi. Update 5: Finally after testing the replacement phone I must say it is worth the buy. But only thing is you need to be lucky enough to get a quality and defect free device. But Xiaomi India customer care is really poor as the questions I asked (under update 4) are still unanswered.
0|5|I was losing interest in Androids and was looking forward to buy an iPhone 6, but after going through the reviews I felt of giving Mi4i a shot. And I think it is one of the best decision I have made in my life. Save me a lot of bucks and with the new miui 7 upgrade its super smooth and it has brought my lost love for androids back. Mark my words Xiaomi is going to kill Apple in years to come. What quality. Pros 1) The best feature is the screen, iPhone or any other Smartphones can't match the quality, it's out of the world. 2) The 13 MP Camera is outstanding, we get rich colours with great accuracy. 3) The interface is buttery smooth and I am in love with it. Any iOS migrant would love it. 4) The gaming performance is extremely smooth. Cons None...But if they could provide a Screen Protector in the box it would've been even more awesome. Go for it Strongly recommended !!!
0|5|Got this mobile in big billion sale in 9k (10k + 10% bank offer). Coming to the points about this phone 1. MIUI 7 update has arrived to Mi 4i and it has solved all problems with phone. Dont believe anyone who says phone gets overheated. I have tested it using CPU-Z application, now temperatures remain within 38-43 degree limits and at the same time Xiaomi has enabled all 8 cores at the same time (earlier only 6 cores were enabled in normal mode to prevent overheating which resulted in lags , stutter and slow performance) but now phone gives better performance with all 8 cores On and almost no lags. Now phone is faster than ever before (company claims 30% fast and 10% more battery efficient). Just make sure to update your phone as first thing to do before using your phone (update is around 800 MB). Little heating is still there while making calls but it is very tolerable. Almost all android phones do so, even my Galaxy S2 used to heat way much more than this. 2. Battery backup (3120mah) is awesome. Keeping full day Wi-Fi on and medium usage like surfing web, youtube, playing music (I dont play games), battery is still 55% at the end of the day and you can easily use it till next day as well. Also charging time is decent (2.5 hours max). 3. After update to MIUI 7, free Ram is also increased 850MB. And phone has become less laggy and faster. 4. Camera is really class. Beautiful stunning pics captured. I actually bought it because of its camera. 5. Storage is limited as you all know..but it does not bother me that much. Display is very sharp and one of the best displays out there in market. 6. Phone is very stylish and so lightweight (130 gm) considering massive battery 3120 mah. So looks wise no complaints at all. 7. The best thing buying xiaomi phone is software update cycle is very frequent and they take into account users feedback seriously. I hope phone will be improved further in future. Only competitor I find is Coolpad Note 3, but dont know its service since its a new company. If you can get this phone under 10k, then its a deal..
0|1|I bought with exchange policy. My phone was having a very small scratch at the corner, but it was not accepted by the delivery guy. Overall my order was cancelled after 15 days. A very bad experience as I could not utilise advantages of Big Billion day sale.
0|1|This phone heats so much on changing that it cannot be used during charging or untill it cools after the charging is complete. What is the use of fancy features and latest technology when such basic things are not taken care of?
0|4|yes , the mi4i is awesome phone , the battery is also good . poeple should buy tis stuff bez the camera quality is very good.
0|1|The phone heats up like crazy. Xiaomi's own MIUI interface sucks and is very disorienting for an old time Android user. An extremely poor phone that is good only if you consider the technical specification sheet. Repent buying the phone.
1|5|yuppe chinese heat i am rating it 5 because it saved my LPG cylinder for 5 days.meet revolutionary technology made for cooking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!china rocks
0|1|1. Mobile heating problem 2. Internet Issue 3. Apps are hanging 4. 2GB RAM but after using 2,3 apps Free RAM only 400 MB 5. Slow processing. 6. You miss your call due to low sound quality Don't purchase it guys, worst phone i had use till date. Wasted my 13K. Overall not working as per specification given.
1|4|With MIUI7 developer rom, phone is working like breeze. Battery with 2 sims is lasting for atleast 1.5 days. Camera is good. No heating issues. Worth buying
0|1|within 1 month 5 days mobile starting a lot of problem ..currently in service center of MI ,they are telling 25 days need to take display and motherboard change .. heating issue after updated also .. battery worst ever .. hang even small app .. camera quality is good and UI is only good
1|1|Useless phone After 3 months of usage, touch of my phone not working. Xiaomi should spend some money on testing before selling the product Xiaomi has only few service centers in India. So have a look at service centers before purchasing the product
0|5|Using this phone since 4 weeks!!! Marvellous Phone with excellent battery life, excellent camera, excellent volume capabilities and storage. Didn't experience any kind of heating problem even without updating...I am really serious! I was very much disturbed to find the reviews indicating heating problems before buying this...but i have been using it since 4 weeks without that update of 860 MB and still no heating! I have played angry birds, Car races-3D, and even Iron Man-3 and other from google play without any Hanging or heating....!! So just go for it!! Battery needs charging only after 2 days of vigorous using!! I am a satisfied customer.... :-)
0|5|This is a great phone in almost every aspect. You may have noticed reviews of overheating, hardware failure, cheap Chinese phone etc. Since many people tries to compare Xiami with apple so these are my observations, First off all Apple iPhone available in our country is made in china and almost all of their hardware are China, Taiwan, South Korea based company made (Foxconn, Samsung etc). So please do some research before talking bullshit. Regarding poor QAQC I will say my own ipod touch 4G's home button broke down just after its warranty period was expired. Talked to Apple support and found Apple service centre at Kolkata. But they told me it will cost 16000. One of my colleagues iphone display showing problem within 4 months. This is their top notch QAQC process. Besides everybody knows the last iphone bending issue. Now our problem is, if it is a popular brand and showing some problem, it is bad luck but for Xiami, it is just a cheap Chinese phone so it will show problem. Again 13000 phone is cheap but Apple’s 71% OVERPRICED (teardown) iphone is WORTHY!! We are such a FOOOOOLLLL. My god. And most of the companies are taking advantage of our lack of knowledge. OK, I am not comparing it with Apple, just few examples. For those who believes blindly in Apple, Samsung, please read in depth about their hardware before making fan boy comments. Enough said, coming to pros and cons, Pros: 1. Very well designed phone and superb build quality in this price point. They are very careful to the box packing of the phone as well. You will definitely admire this, once you move your figure over and inside the box. 2. Nice finishing and sleek design, light weight. You will feel that you are holding a much expensive phone. 3. It does not HEATS LIKE A HEATER NOT EVEN CLOSE TO IT. It might get worm during 3g download, gaming, charging but it is definitely not a deal breaker. Please switch to balanced mode and keep S/w up to date. 4. Awesome display resolution and 441 pixel density. Brightness level and colour saturation is also amazing. 5. Camera is also very crisp and clear compared to any other phone up to 25000k price tag approx. 6. Snapdragon processor even in balanced mode and 2GB LPDDR3 makes miui buttery smooth and fluid. But you will get only 800MB avg free ram. 7. Sound quality is also good (not great) but call clarity is EXCELLENT. Cons: 1. The major problem with MI is less number of service centre in India. Since they manufacture less no of device so their spare parts availability is also an issue. I have goggled a lot and found that they take long to repair (as long as 1 month). It is really annoying. 2. The MIUI though very well designed, intuitive, customizable, good looking UI but it feels like a copy more or less of IOS. And I totally dislike this area. They must develop something of their own. 3. Nothing So whatever you decide it’s up to you but I will definitely recommend this phone. Last of all, Flipkart service is ONE OF THE BEST and I have not experienced any problem in last 3 years with any replacement. Thanks for reading my review.
0|1|I must say when i brought this phone i was the happiest person of the world.. But my happiness came to end after usage of 15 days of this phone. Initially the phone worked very nicely but One day suddenly my phone was dead, yes just like that. I have provided my phone to service center they said that the phone repairing will cost me 9000 bucks. And i was shocked like hell. Additionally they said that there was liquid contents in my phone. I could not imagine whether they lied straight on my face or there was liquid from the start. I dont know how much this review helps but if i was at your place i would have used that money somewhere else. I have saved money for 4 months to buy this phone and it is feeling real bad inside. SO THANK YOU MI FOR OPENING MY EYES.
0|1|not satisfy with mobile n service,heavy phone not with good battery.heating problem no memory card slot n network problem
1|1|I would give -5 stars if that would have been an option. After they deliver a faulty product - for replacement I was literally tormented by Flipkart's Customer Service and their Delivery boys. After Multiple Escalations to managers, somehow I managed to get my phone for the money I paid. Anyways, my last order for Flipkart... they don't care once they get the payment.. Suggestion - Please close your customer service department. It is an NVA for you and you would save a lot of money.
0|1|I had bought this phone on 23rd May 2015 and used it with out any problem and believed the phone is very good up to 19th July 2015. Suddenly the speakers had failed so no ring tone and speaker was not working. Went personally to on 20th July 2015 to HCL touch authorised service center for MI had to wait for atleast 2 hours to be attended and the Service took about a week and the phone was delivered on 25th July 2015 with out battery on it. I had again visit on 29th to complain about over heating like a hote plate, charging for entire night but still no use battery drains very fast and then never goes up on charging to more than 40% after which we need to lift the phone only with gloves as it is very hot against visited the service center on 31st July 2015 who said in 15 minutes the problem will be resolved as they will reset the phone and give after 15 minutes of charging again the phone was a hot plate and the service center advised me to leave the handset for another 7 days to 10 days to which i replied they can take 20 days time but need to give me the hand set as i had purchased. Due not having a back up phone I had lost many business calls and i do not recommend any one to buy. If you are unlucky like me you will waste your time and end to up into problem of buying a bad product. I am planning to spread the message to atleast 2000 people whom I know. I suspect the service center had replaced my good battery to a bad battery set as the phone / hand set is sealed as you cannot remove battery. If company persons and flipkart read this message take this very serious as service center persons does not give genuine information about this phone when the trouble starts.
0|1|Yesterday I went to get my Mi repaired at REDNIGTON. I was shocked to see the large no of people lined up for repairs....The entry register of 30th was full page for complaints, what must be the status on other days is not known. On the top of it the behavious of REDINGTON staff was pathetic. U cannot afford to wait for 5-7 hours to get your phone checked up. There are no service counters, no staff except two receptionist, 2 reapirs person, handling MANY PRODUCTS BRANDS. And the Manager Ashish is horrible. I came back unattended........Guys next time Ill send pics too.
0|1|I bought this phone about month and half ago. It hardly worked fro 10 days and then its battery stopped charging. Gave to Mi service center in Noida. They took 15 days and said it's ok. Checked the charging at home - it doesn't work. Service center is pathetically managed, staff is least bothered about customers.
0|5|I have ordered this product from my friends account since there was a flash sale in the start. Having used this phone from past 3 months or probably more than that my conclusion is this phone is superb .Better than any so called branded phones.Heats up very little which is common in any snapdragon processor but neglibile,camera is awesome,front camera is excellent because of beautiy software, miui 6.5.6 User interface is quick,display is superb ,though a lag caused by 2gb ram when play 2k videos ,2k and above format requires 3 gb ram so thats fine .All in all if you compare battery ,display ,camera ,built quality,price ,looks ,software i give high five....Only suggestion to flipkart or Xiaomi is please stop this nonsense flash sale if this is marketting gimmick it is fine but have all the colors and provide sale and reachout to all people in one go....there is a chance that people will be fed of the duration of registration and may move on to other brands ,Since Xiaomi is awesome Brand i dont think they require any gimmicks .
1|1|Phone was ok.After a week of usage,i dropped the phone. And the Corning OGS glass is gone !!. Though i gave it for a replacement when i enquired after twenty days,the Service center replied that it might still take more than a month as Xiaomi is not supplying any spares for Mi 4i. So, Please don't buy this,if it might fall down even once
0|3|This device should've been a master piece but it missed this opportunity in terms of comfort It heats too much that's the problem with this device. The buiild quality is awesome feels premium the moment you touch it. Screen is full HD. Vivid and bright. Very ligjt. Battery back up is awesome. For me it last for 18 hrs at least. Miui 6 is OK. But lags on balanced mode. Needs update. Camera is descent in day light. During night you would not want to use this camera Front camera is awesome with beautify mode. Processor clocks 1.1 GHz fof normal use and 1.65 GHz for heavy apps. Games won't lag for first 10 mins after it starts heating and then lag starts. Browsing is good experience due to full hd screen. Corning ogs protection works didn't found any scratches yet. Sound is ok. Call clarity is good. Network reception is good. Touch is very good. Headphone output is awesome enhanced by MI sound enhancer. Heat. It heats too much you can't even play games. I hope they release some update that should resolve this issue.
0|5|I had ordered for Mi4i White before the Grey one was available. The very day after ordering I saw that Grey is coming for sale next week, so I canceled and waited to buy the grey one and eventually I purchased it last Thursday and got it delivered on Friday morning..I am so happy that I waited for the grey one.. This phone is fantabulous for the price that it comes for..My office colleagues who own Mi3 and Mi4 liked the design of Mi4i compared to their handsets..It's smaller and handier in size and has a very sleek design..Talk about performance, it just rocks..I played Asphalt the same day and it runs very smoothly..I also tested the cameras and recorded a full HD video using the front cam..just brilliant! Battery life is super cool..I charge it to 100% in the morning and by the time I come home in the evening, the battery still remains at 70% or higher with normal usage throughout the day.. The handset I got, comes with the latest MIUI 6 and I did not experience any heating problems even after testing it with heavy usage while accessing multiple apps, calls and even with heavy gaming...for people who need more storage space, this could be the only constraint..for me 16 GB is just fine..I could never exhaust 16 GB in my old phone including internal and external memory.. So, in a nutshell, here are the pros and cons: Pros: 1. Great pricing for the phone specs 2. Great design, look and feel + very handy 3. Lag free top end performance 4. Amazing display and camera quality 5. Great battery life 6. 4G support Cons: 1. Fixed storage space of 16 GB (Concern for only those who need heavy storage in the phone)
0|3|I am not able to hear the ringing sound even it is in my pocket or next to me.heating problem is also there.but display is awesome.
1|1|Phone is overheating, also hangs. Even the sound is not clear How can you flipkart keep such a phone. Return policy is bad. These guys are just telling to update but nothing worked out. Please take this phone back

0|5|Writing this review after 3 days of use. First of all coming to the body design : awesome is the word for it very sleek design smooth matte finish at the back and front full black. Next talking about the display : yes full hd it is 441ppi excellent display bt in sunlight the sunlight display feature of this phone dosent work very well does help tho. reading in sunlight is above average i can say. Coming to the most talked Camera of mi 4i : Believe me you wont regret buying this phone if you buy it for camera purpose. one of the best camera i have come across .FRont and rear work extremely well in good light conditions in low light gives some grains bt that is with all the midrange devices. can compare the picture quality with that of all high end samsung phones and iphone 5s . Battery : this is the part where it dissapoints a little tho it is 3100 apprx mA battery it dosent last more than a working day if u use wifi and browse for say 3 - 4 hrs.if u use it mediocarly it can last more than a day so not for gamers. performance : it is good i can say supports high graphic games like asphalt8 and many more. There are some rumors on in the market that this phone heats up and it is a big problem n shit believe there is literally nothing like that infact phone is cool fir most of the time except when u play games. lastly thank u flipkart for really fast delivery..!!!! hope this review helps you. neglecting the battery problem ill give 5 stars.
1|1|I have ordered this phone on 21st of MAY. I got it on the next day itself. But Be careful about the display. There are some dead pixel in it. There is heating issue. Phone restarts and sometime screen movement is there without touch. Overall not satisfactory with this product.
1|1|i purchased phone on 10 june but it has heating problem , phone gets heat up after 10 min of surfing.i requested for return but the flipkart refused to return.....i suggest not to purcahse any electronic item from flipkart
1|5|I bought this phone couple of weeks back. I took the updates and it's working perfectly. There is no heating issue or anything. It may become a little bit warm when playing HD game / webpages using more graphics contents . It's not getting heated when using WiFI or 3G. Really worth for money.
0|5|Before I go into my first week review, a little background on my smartphone experience. I started with Samsung S3 and then jumped up to HTC One M8 and finally landed on the Mi 4i. I gave away my HTC One M8 to my dad and I wanted to try something in the lower price bracket. I am not expecting at par performance with the M8 because few phones can match its performance but if the Mi 4i can even come 70% close to meeting the M8's awesome feel I will be grateful. A week has passed and I had ordered this on the 11th June registered sale. I got a defective piece on 12th June, the phone just did not start even after fully charging the batteries. Called up Flipkart customer care and they were prompt in replacing the set. I got my replacement on 14th June and now have used it for 3 days. I feel 3 days is enough to get a first impression of any phone and here's my take. Design: 7/10 I loved the metallic design and the curves of the HTC One M8 and compared to that the Mi 4i is a bit plastic but for the price it sure does look glamorous. Just pair it with a good cover and it is sure to stand out from the crowd. Screen: 10/10 Yup, the screen clarity is at par with the HTC One M8. In fact, the sharpness of logos and icons, text is just uncanny. Downside though is that notification top bar is tiny and at times so are other areas but at least very very clear. Videos in HD look beautiful. Camera: 9/10 Back camera takes awesome pictures although low light pics leave a bit to the imagination. Overall though the camera is splendid with aperture control, real time effect control, HDR and other controls while you take a picture. Front camera is equally impressive and I feel that both cameras actually deliver above the price tag of the phone. Music: 10/10 I don't really care for music from the built-in speakers neither do I ever use a phone to listen to music. Frankly phones can never come close to the quality you get from good music players or DACs. I use a Cowon D2+ with a E11K Amp paired with an AudioTechnica M50x to listen to music so trust me when I say this - this is the best damn sounding phone I have tried thus far with headphones on. Built-in equalizer does a wonderful job and it works even if you try it with internet radio apps such as Gaana, Murfie and more. Connectivity: 7/10 WiFi I feel is a bit sluggish but it is ok, not something I can't live without. Mobile Data connection though feels more fluid. You get a 3.5mm jack and a data charging mini-USB port. No expansion slot to add a memory card, so beware if you think otherwise. What it does support is OTG so you can connect hard drives or pen drives directly and use data stored there to play videos and more. Heating & Performance: 7/10 The phone does heat up when it charges battery, when you are on a call for long or doing something processor intensive such as multi-tasking or playing a game. It is not unbearable and similar to what I faced with the Samsung S3. As for performance, you have two modes, Balanced and Performance mode. In the balanced mode, it is sluggish and can at times hang on some apps, mine does on Murfie. In the performance mode, it is just slightly sluggish at times but most of the time fluent. Just remember to manually drop apps that you are finished using. Overall: 10/10 Considering the price tag of the phone, you better not expect a 10 by 10 in all departments but overall for the areas where it does average, it has plenty more where it excels. So for just 13k this is the best damn phone right now in the market and I am comparing it to phones as high as 17 to 18k. PS: Get the Graphene Armor ULTRA HD tempered glass to protect your screen, it does not detract from the screen in any way and also remember to download the 800MB update the moment you get your phone setup, it does take care of many issues previously mentioned by other reviewers.
0|1|It hangs frequently, Very slow phone , Heating Issues, MIUI user interface is quite annoying !! My personal experience and some of my friends too so guys never buy this Bullshit in 13000 RS !!
0|1|I have purchased this phone, made a complaint earlier and now after almost a month phone stopped working, You can dial a number but neither you can receive a call nor you can recive calls. Exptremely unhappy with the phone or the service. Reg
1|1|over heating during internet and camera use. battery is unsufficient due to over heating. fix this problem then phone will be excellent.
0|5|Like other customer, I too brought this phone after reading lot of reviews from different websites. The reviews below are long, but I thought that it might help someone for effective usage of product. The reviews below are intended for those who made up their mind for buying the product and blocked due to negative critics. The features of the phone is already mentioned everywhere and there is nothing to add into it. There were negative comments and my opinion is that there are no products in world which can satisfy 100 % customers. Even iphone 6 has few 1 star rating. Battery – It is 3000 mAH and it can easily stand up to 24 hours.( Note that the heavy usage is different from person to person. For some, heavy usage is playing games all the day where display as well as processor/ ram will be running at high speed. For some, it all about browsing and reading news papers. For some it is being active in social media for the whole day.So let me explain my scenario where it stood for 1 full day.(24 hrs) • Continuous messaging on whats app where I keep receiving and sending messages. • Play Asphalt 8 game for almost 1 hour a day • Check facebook along with few videos in posts, for approximately 30-45 minute each and also checking mails. • Read news papers of various languages for approx 2 hour a day • The syncing is on during the period for face book, whatsapp, gmail and corporate mail for the whole day. After reading battery usage statistics, ( phone data in 3g) Screen time on - 6 hours with 50 % brightness All other apps were running in background. There were days where it stood for more than 1.5 days where i have not played games during those period. Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during Gaming No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt 8 + Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS - No headphones - lack of accessories in market Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly. IMPORTANT POINT: After opening the box, use the phone with battery and drain completely. Charge the phone to 100% in switch off mode. ( Note – No overcharging or overnight recharge) Repeat the same for 3 cycles ( use and complete drain, then recharge). After 3 cycles, always charge the phone only when the battery is below 10 % and charge fully. Heating of Mobile is Common for first 2-3 days, use these 3 days heavily,
1|1|Hello everyone I am using this product from 28th may, bought in recent sale and from the very first day I am facing the performance issues with my Mi 4i respective to Battery performance,Camera and most important phone speed performance. As company said they installed Octacore Processor of top Brand snapdragon Quallcom but as per my experience it is very sluggish peformance. even MY Moto E is performing very much fast than Mi 4i. So fellas advice for all think before buying that phone. please check that phone before buying if any of your known having that Mi 4i. I will never recommend anyone to buy this phone,better to buy iphone 4s 8GB at same cost. Atleast Apple having Brand value in the world.
1|1|I turned on the device and tried connecting to Wi-Fi but no network is being detected, when reported to Mi support they asked to reboot but no difference was seen.I called flipkart support and as they said their technician called back within half a day. Here's where it goes crazy, They asked me to perform a factory reset and I did which turned useless.Then they gave me link to download an APK so that they could remotely test it. I told them I couldn't do that because the issue itself was that I couldn't connect to Wi-Fi. They asked me to use mobile Internet, for which I said that I don't have Internet on my sim card as this was my first smartphone, I didn't have it till now. They say I'm supposed to have it one way or other. Now even if I have the mobile network and they do fix the issue, why should I keep this piece which is faulty in the first place. I hope they replace the product without aany melodrama. -Tired of speaking to them.
0|1|in my Mi4i since starting my mobile browser is not working, even i registered a complain then also i got no resolvement. Mobile browser is just basic thing to execute the how could i expect beyond.!! MI u r "Bowled" as in even 13K bucks this product didn't have external support!
0|5|This is my 4th day with this new phone .Look wise no doubt best phone in recent market. feature wise also great .Mi really done fabulous job giving all best things in this budget.heating issue is also drastically vanished ,i would say not like earlier Mi phones.you will immediate updates from MI after you switch on the phone. Pros - 1.Looks wise very nice ,size is also very handy and portable 2.display is awesome 3.camera superb 4.battery is best ,it is giving almost 24 hrs even more than that if u r average user .i have not tested with high end gaming 5.light weight cons-no external SD card slot ( for me it is ok bcz you will have 12.5 GB to use ,i think this is enough for me ,you can also use external OTG for viewing movies or listening songs ) 2.no screen guard with the box.
0|1|I purchased this mobile in the latest flash sale, once I turned on the mobile the phone was heating up like anything and I ran the update still had the issue. Called customer care they asked me to reset my phone did it, still the same issue. Asked me to run a smart check in my mob n they provided me the results I didn't see anything in my mobile. No refund for the mobile. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOBILE, CUSTOMER CARE IS JUST BOGUS. THEY ARE NOT READY TO HELP U.
0|5|i recieved the phone opened it. PROS: 1) premium build quality. looks sexy 2) best display 3) i love miui. it is awesome. 4) great camera software and hardware. 5) good battery backup. 6) moderate heating issue. thats normal with intensive usage. CONS: 1) speakers are moderate. the phone is highly reliable and durable. mine was even dropped by me once but everything is fine. costumer support is also good. must buy. i am really happy after buying this phone.
0|3|Using since 1 week. Pros: 1.Slim & light weight 2.Very good front camera 3.Battery lasts for a day 4.Good call quality 5.Excellent display Cons: 1.Even after update, heating issue above normal level - while charging, playing games, camera on etc. 2.Power button too sharp, noisy, poor quality. We can even identify Mi4i user by his damaged finger tips after few weeks of usage!! 3.Wi-fi not getting connected - forcing me to use mobile data only 4.Rear camera seems to have samsung sensor & pictures are of 8 MP only - Zooming cause noisy images; camera protrudes out in upper part 5.Speaker volume very low - have to place rear side up to be audible - otherwise ring tone may be missed. 6.Phone lags during playing subway surfer. 7.Poor RAM management - only 700 MB available for usage even after clearing cache 8.No colour flipcovers available at MI.COM 9.UI not so smooth as expected - hangs occasionally. 10.Too Tight chager port. I wonder how they missed pathetic sharp buttons, rear camera protrusion, low speaker output & abnormal heating etc. - shows their quality contol. To conclude, not fully satisfied & I have the doubt whether it lasts for atleast 1 year.
0|5|Brilliant Display, Excellent UI, Nice sound, Slim and light - are some of the features of this phone. Its been a week since I bought this phone and haven't faced any issues so far. The phone responds really well and doesn't feel like a low priced one. The heating issue that everyone are complaining about doesn't occur after the update (800 mb).
0|1|you will never be satisfied.instead go for lumia 730 in this range.remember ppi density of 441 only will not satisfy you.
0|1|At the launch Mr, Hugo Bara created hype. pls dont go such trap of Flipkart and company. 13000 is matter, better put 1-2 K more and buy other known brand product with low configuration , even better compare to them and long losting. Flipkart. 1. First Thing Flipkart is not having return policy for that, they just make you irritate when you try to tell them your problem. so decide only you wanted to throw away ur money at any case. 2. People from Flipkart call center think you are a fool, so they will give silly solutions , like restrat the phone, clear the cache etc. 3. Quality of flipkart product is deteriorate now a days. i had made many purchase recently but need to return. Phone mi4i 1. Basic Call feature is not up to mark , like sound quality, speaker quality, vibration etc. 2. Battery drains badly(even after update to 805 MB crap) 3-4 hrs in 3g and continue use, normal 7-8 hrs 3. Camera is not sync with flash, flash is so high even can damage your eyes, but picture still dark. 4.Heating problem at ear 5. Camera Is good in daylight, shit in night with flush 6. While call MIUI hangs 7. Camera lags, slows. 8. not a strong device, may break even fall from pocket good front Camera, and display. 9. terrible network issue, My idea and airtell both are facing network issue in this phone, earlier good with samsung trend. SO dont purchase if you want for call feature, buy if want to click pics in full lights. Its genuine review after 5 days use. i will revise review/rating once there is any update which improve above difficulties
1|4|Awesome camera, beautiful display and after recent update, phone does not heat too much which was reported earlier by most users. Asphalt 8 Airborne runs smoothly on it without heating up phone back. Sound output is little low, but with other awesome features, this is really one of the great value for money phone.
1|1|tis is a product which has serious issue in the speaker phone ( volume negligible) and heating . when i tried to returned it was impossible they wrote on my request closed as the issue resolved , which clearly is not the case. their return policy is not upto the mark
1|4|A lot has been said about the product so i shall keep my review to the point,for the benefit of the prospective buyer: INCORRECT PAST REVIEWS: HEATING:do not believe the others' review of heating,there's a software update available when u log into the phone,install it-this takes time sure,but once u do,you're sorted.AND VERY IMPORTANT- THE PHONE DOESNT HEAT UP WHILE CHARGING.in no case is the very mild heat produced,greater than any samsung or sony phone.Hell my previous htc 1v heated up more.STOP MISLEADING IDIOT REVIEWERS PERFOMANCE:have no doubts in your mind that the phone would not live to the expectations.ppl have written that the gaming experience isn't good.the octa core processor was running 3 downloads of mine from utorrent,was moving my files from gallery and at the same time i was chatting on whatsapp,so please haters STFU Features that i cant get enough of:(prime boasting grounds for the mi4i) DISPLAY(the full hd display is surreal,its AWESOME) CHARGER:HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING,the charger is loaded with some serious power your phone charges up in minutes!!my friend charged his samsung smartphone with mi charger;in 8 minutes his phone had charged 39%.Enough said BATTERY:the above being said,apart from the first time i've never needed to charge my phone from 0 to 100%(ps this depends on user to user usage,and therefore is subjective).point is my phone always has battery ALWAYS! SCREEN SIZE & HANDLING(with a 5 inch 1920p screen the phone is outstandingly,unbelievably light;you'd be worried about the phone slipping out of your hand) PROS: PROCESSING(octa core of the phone silences all critics,put it up to test and you shall find out) FAST-the phone is as fast as you would expect it to be.you'll feel sorry for yourself to have expected anything less at 13k. DISPLAY:the display proves the phone's worth in gold.Watching movies,Videos,images is a treat. CAMERA:SERIOUSLY,why are we even discussing this? :-D man i would've put up an elongated D if keyboards came up with such an option CONS:amazingly the 4i defaults on the most basic stuff which u would expect to have no problems with,in any other phone STORAGE:THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM WHEN YOU BUY THIS PHONE.SPECS STATE 12.7GB USER MEMORY AVAILABLE,ONCE YOU PORT IN YOUR 4i TO YOUR PC IT SHOWS ONLY9.5GB AVAILABLE.THERE'S NO MICROSD SLOT NO MEMORY CARD CAN BE INSTALLED AND U NEED TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO THE PC FOR TRANSFERRING DATA FROM YOUR OLD PHONE. MUSIC PLAYER:the default mi music player doesnt have a shuffle or playlist option!are you kidding me?But rest assured,google play comes preinstalled,which works like a gem,so no problems there. Conclusion:the only better phone in the market is htc 1 + 1(22k) and yes i mean that no other android phone can touch it.this product is aimed at changing the perception of consumers of "made in china".take my word for it. by the way 1+2 is due for release.
0|1|Hi friends, In 2015 it was my worst decision to buy Chinese mobile. I always preferred branded phone, but I don't know some how why I buy this useless and senseless phone. I buy phone on 23 of may And reviewd. 1. battery backup not up to the mark I charge mi4i in a day at max 3 times. I have also samsung note 3 which battery work for a full day in 50% charge.note 3 battery is 3220 mah And 3120mah. 2. Camera is good for day time. But in case of room it is not working.image colors like Chinese phone. 3. 2gb ram is not up to the mark.it is working like 1 gb ram. Phone is slow and not working fast in heavy games. 4. Phone heating problem .mi4i phone heat up to 55'C during play any andriod game, you can easly made a egg omelette at phone. 5. Touch screen is not well. Some time touch not work. 6.you can get one thing super , that is mobile look.it is good. I think mi4i should take back all phones and first try to solve problems. Plz plz plz plz don't buy .increase your budget and get some branded phone. I try many request to solve the problem or refund my hard earning money.
0|2|Features and specifications of the Mi4i is very good. But due to the lack of a detailed user manual, we are not able to use most of the newly provided features. Hard copy or soft copy of user manual in pdf fomart shall be provided immedietely.
1|1|I bought this Phone from the flash sale and certainly not happy with the day I received this phone with following reasons: 1. Whenever you dial any calls , the screen goes blank and then you can't do anything and not even you can disconnect the phone from your end, unless someone from the receiving end doesn't disconect the phone, your screen will not re-appear. The reason is because the screen guard is covering the proximity sensor which is causing this issue. Now tell me how can we use phone without a screen guard. Mi is offering free screen guard for its buyers , but its be around 10days since I placed my request for screen guard and haven't received it yet nor there is any tracking ID that was generated , so I have no idea how to track my request 2. Heating issues : Mi4i get heats up as soon as you keep the phone on charging and suppose you want to receive or make any phone calls, then you are helpless because your ear will suffer due to heating issue. Even if you use your phone for doing normal work like browsing internet then also phone heats up. Yesterday there was an update released by Xiaomi which they claim will fix the heating issue, but even though I have installed the update it hasn't fixed my issue. I have also placed a return request with Flipkart for this phone which is going on since 10days , but Flipkart customer service response is very bad and there are no followups from their end. My honest advice to anyone who is planning to buy this Phone will be that : "Please do not buy this phone and look out for some other better options"
0|1|Worst phone... don't buy my dear friends. If you speak 2 mins in the hot sun, the phone is getting over heated like anything. even you can't touch the phone for sometime. i spoke and update the same to the filpkart, they said that you need to go service center.
0|3|I have been using this phone for the past 7days, the major issue is ringtone sound, while on move I dont' hear the ring sound even after the sound is adjusted to max level, even I tried my own ringtone with rocking sound. So I hardly attend any incoming calls, in call log missed call list & outgoing are more than incoming calls. kindly fix up the same
1|1|Please don't buy this phone Its most heated device i have seen t ill date, like a Iron box. And its causing problem connecting to google services and some websites. Camera doesn't wort out well sometime, works wieredly totally frustrated using this Requested for return 3 days back, flipkart execuitives not responding properly which is even more frustrating Don't buy this Sorry to say this, for the first time i am experiencing bad customer responses from Flipkart.
0|1|Its a smart phone?? That does not allow you to configur exchange emails due to lack of encryption option!! Was shocked to know this. Its possible on even a 4000 Rs local smart phone. Though rest of the phone looks and feels good, this was a spoiler for me as its one of the most important feature for me and a lot of corporate employees am sure. Still chasing to get a refund.
0|2|pros:build quality,display,battery(only on balanced mode) cons: Lag in camera,software bug,sim-card heats as phone heat and no basic incoming call function not working.,speaker place on bottom is very bad, I suggest not to buy this product till higher memory and heating issue resolved. I waited for almost 6 months after Mi3 and get this crap instead of flagship. snapdragon 615 is not good processor,its laggy.
0|1|Completely let down product. It just hang so much then heat so much. Some time noo sim shows. Total failure as far my experience is concerned.
0|3|yes , the phone is really good to hold, good display, and really good cam.Really good selfie cam and rear cam is also good. but , heats up while charging the phone , when camera app is on and while playing games. and no expandable memory and lags while loading some apps like wechat and some other apps, dont know the reason. moto g 1st gen loads the same version of wechat much faster. You get 901 Mb of ram available when no app is running , ie the os itself takes 1 gb of ram. which is sufficient for normal users. Dont understand this octa core thing, it eats up battery , heats up alot and gives much lower perfomance . They could have used a Snapdragon 801 instread which would have been better.
0|3|I feel the the Fone is Good instead of the Main speaker Low sound . I have compared with this other fones . I have made a return request. Does any one also have same problem ?
0|3|MiUi again ruined another amazing phone Xiaomi launched! It looks like Xiaomi is not willing to mend it's generic UI issues which spoils every model they launch even today. Cons:- 1 - LAGGY and SLUGGISH user interface. There is a noticeable lag in everything you operate, right from performing basic tasks to opening new apps. 2 - Basic apps close down while multi-tasking. 3 - Only around 750Mb of RAM available! I don't understand what is the use of purchasing a phone with 2Gb of RAM when all of it is consumed by the system itself! This implies that how much you spend and upgrade the hardware, it is of no use if you have such an inefficient software. 4 - Rear speaker volume tooooo lowwww! I think Hugo Barra saved a million by providing such useless speakers! Forget about listening music, get ready to miss most of your calls in the slightest of a noisy environment. 5 - MiUi is obsessed with apple and iOS till date. Grow up! Pros:- 1 - Great camera (Both) and dual tone flash. 2 - Nice Full HD display. 3 - Good battery backup. 4 - Good looks and design. Slim phone with thin bezels.
0|3|Very fast delivery from Flipkart. I got it in a day. Very happy with service of Flipkart but the back cover and screenguard could have been provided by same seller WSR unfortunately for these you havo to lookout for other sellers. I booked screen guard and back cover on same day of this item booking but still i didn't get the items its already 5 days and they are still in transit. Writing this review based on 5 days of usage of Mi4i. Both cameras are good. Good touch response. Smooth performance - No lags. Pathetic thing is it Heats up a lot when playing games, using internet, Using camera and charging :( Battery depends on usage.. Continuous usage will last for 5 to 6 hrs.. Medium user can get complete day.. and if used only for calls then will get for 2 days approx. Dual sim standby works perfectly. Due to heating issue i will not recommend to buy this as heating device annoys a lot. hence i have given only 3 stars.
0|5|Received phone 2 days ahead of committed delivery date. Phone is excellent. Good Screen resolution. Good photos with camera. Very light weight. Good battery life. No heating issues so far. Only concern is low sound of speakers. Very low sound on Ring tone compared to my old Samsung phone.
1|1|The worst ever phone I have purchased so far. I was duped by the display which is the only factor to be accepted. Please do not buy. The phone is heating so quick and even without playing games also. You can't even speak with the phone near by your ear. Your ear will burn out. My 13000 is gone with the wind. Please do not by. The registration is only to create an artificial demand. The reviews are paid and don't be fooled by them.
0|1|I have unpack it 2hrs before but m not able to use it as the screen going black repeatedly... Very disappointed..... Instead of using this i am now thinking to go on with my current phone which is Redmi 1S,its much more better than it.
1|1|No doubt the phone is good and camera quality is really awesome BUT heating issue is there on calling. I have been using this phone from last 10 days and on call the battery temperature goes to 42 degree I feel like the phone going to blast at any time on calls. So I can say its just wastage of money.
0|4|I am using Mi 4i since 2 weeks. Camera was excellent. Excellent Smartphone with lightweight. Easy to handle the phone. MIUI will give you a pleasant experience. Excellent battery backup. It will last at least 36 hours for light usage. Initially I face some heating issues on setting he phone. Later I updated it with the latest OTA of 802 MB and did a factory reset, Now there is no heating issue also everything is working fine. It works flawlessly. Now I recommend this to my friends without hesitation. Please ignore the comments of people who are not aware of how to update the smartphones and please go for it.. A beautiful beast.. Thanks for Xiaomi for excellent smartphone with reasonable price.
1|1|Every thing is good expect heating problem and Nobody would like to have a phone which heats even on talking.
0|1|After clicking two images rear camera stop working. Rest phone is ok. But not getting proper support from flipkart even after many contacts my has not been replaced.
1|1|Heating Problem while using Internet Phone off automatically and dont know what to do No Headset No Screen Guard
0|3|Hello, I got this product within 3 days of purchase and I have been using it since 02nd May 2015 till date (13th May 2015). Personally, I am not feeling so happy owning a Mi 4i phone for the following reasons. However, there are some pros as well. I will list out both: Pros: 1. I noticed that the battery life is excellent. I start my day (09:00 AM) by charging my phone for an hour (approx.) It gets charged from 20% - 85% within an hour. I use whatsapp for 3 hours in total, games for 0.5 hrs, calls for 1 hour and others apps for 0.5 hours in total. By 23:00, the battery life will be 30% still. 2. The looks & design of the phone is good. It cannot miss anybody's attention while passing by and everybody opens up camera immediately and they say "wow". They call it even light weight. Its just 130gms against Moto g2 149gms and redmi note 4g 175gms. Its plastic back cover isn't too strong but it looks sturdy. It has however passed drop tests (Check out some videos in youtube). 3. Primary camera is good and secondary camera is good. However, if there is low light, say night shots under tubelight condition has pixels. But if its good lighting, people ask "Can I will borrow your phone for taking some pictures". Its that good. Also it comes with time lapse and slow motion video camera. However shutter is slow and quick moving objects are blurred. 4. 2gb RAM is fast enough and good for all gamers. Asphault 8 looks stunning and there is not even a single lag. I just faced 0.5 seconds lag once till date. 5. You get constant updates from MI on the software and it will keep coming in as long as lollipop is evolving better. So no need to worry about small small complaints. 6. Phone is handy to hold and to operate and the resolution of the screen is rich. Cons: 1. The most concerned issue - heating. Yes, even I face it. Right from starting to play asphault 8 and upto half an hour, the phone heats up mild (say upto 30 degrees celcius). However, it is comparitely mild and you will definitely ignore it. Same was the case if you were taking pics for half an hour. However if you are charging your phone, it heats up till 40 degrees and you cannot keep the phone on your pocket immediately or can you switch on internet data immediately as this will further heat up the phone. After making 1 hour call, the phone was still cold. But to console you, even iphone heats up and you may expect some updates in the future for this. 2. The plastic back cover case is not so sturdy and there are no cases available in the market till date. So use it carefully until market opens. 3. The volume keys and lock key are strong and is difficult to press. Don't know if it can last for a long time. 4. The touch of the screen is in general good, but at times it changes sensitivity on its own and can open up some apps on its own or type something which you never typed. 5. The screen is fixed to set brightness yet I see that the brightness changes on its own. This is really disappointing. Within seconds of me operating, the brightness increases or decreases. 6. The 16gb internal memory although might look big enough space for some normal users like me. Its only 10gb that finally reaches on hand and downloading games such as asphault eats away 1.5gb of space. So if you are a heavy gamer, its not recommended considering the memory constrainst. 7. Finally, don't know if its my set's problem. The videos I shoot and upload on the internet has a green bar on the left hand side of the screen whereas the shot video is crystal clear in the gallery. I have to check on mi 4i forums about it or directly call customer care about it. Decision: My personalized opinion is you can buy this phone if you are fine to change your phone within a year and also you are fine with the above mentioned concerns. However, you do not get a phone of this price for the specs they offer. Moto g2 or leveno A7000 has its own cons and the decision to compromise is on your own choice. Also I have mentioned all criteria as far as possible. Do not read all the comments and confuse yourselves further :-) I don't feel proud buying Mi 4i for other phones.
1|1|I have brought this phone on 30th April and received on 4th May. Phone is not at all worth of 13K. You can get better deal then this crap. Phone heats after charging, Touch screen is worst, Charges is having other issue. Overall product is waste. No quality checks are done by Xiaomi. Overall, I will suggest people to stay away from this product.
1|2|A fantastic and desirable phone... if not for the major disappointment. It heats at the ear piece - above the screen on the front side. That's the last place we want the heat as that hurts the very sensitive ear skin. It heats when charging and when used for browsing or some activity on the phone for abt 10 minutes. But it doesn't heat even during long calls. It is a shame for such a device we'd love to own. Slim, light, powerful, almost scratch proof, all around, great great screen, amazing battery, fantastic cameras... great call quality, beautiful and very very well thought of MIUI. My replacement phone too heats the same way. In fact, maybe a little more than the first one. End of the day, I cannot use this as a smart phone where I work on the phone and pickup a call while working as the ear piece area would be hot by then.
0|1|Unbearable heating and lagging in performance issue makes the phone worst in available. Playing games like Subway surfer for few minutes 2-3 makes the phone lag in its performance with heavy heating. Even I can't compare the performance of MI 4i from Micromax Canvas A1. It takes a huge time for charging while MI claims for fastest ever charging for this phone. From 2 to 36 % of charging It takes 2 hours. There is no comparison of iPhone 6 battery back up with this poor phone. RAM management is not good. Phone always uses 1.5 GB of RAM. Camera, UI, build quality is good.
0|3|I bought this for my mother who will obviously not be using it for intense games and high load apps.My purpose was to order a budget phone with good camera and specs (atleast 2GB RAM and atleast HD resolution). I ordered it on 7th and got it on 12th April and this is my first Xiomi experience. I use Galaxy S4 so I compared Mi4i with it.Below is how I would be rating this : 1.Camera : Primary camera 13 MP: is good if you are clicking pics in daylight.Pictures taken at night or absolute darkness were not so good.Reason : average flash light(flash light range is not so good and the other thing is dual flash which makes things a bit yellowish, this is what i think). I have not used this in low light etc. as who clicks pics in low light and all. Secondary camera 5MP : is okay.I observed before clicking, picture appeared pretty good on screen but after you click and actually take the pic you will see some noise.I don't know the exact reason. Verdict : Camera is good as per price range. 2.Sound: Sound as reviewed my many people is less.Less here does not mean very less but comparatively less than other phones.It was just a bit less than my S4. In headphones it appears to be good and loud like other phones. Verdict : sound from phone speaker is on a lower side. 3.Screen : Screen is very good as it says it is 1080p display.But still it is not as vibrant as Samsung's AMOLED or Super Amoled. Those who are using it for the first time will find it impressive and again I would say it is very good. Verdict : Screen is pretty good. 4.Heating: Normal heating : a person using smartphone will never say that it heats like heater and all.It is just normal :I used the phone for about 4 hrs in a stretch both with and without updation to new software and both ways I found it like other smartphones in term of heating.I surfed the net while chargin,used the cam,played music,used Bluetooth etc. Verdict : normal heating like other smartphones. 5.Look and Feel : White colour, slim and light weight with a pretty common rectangular shape. But I found it as a good to hold product. Verdict : looks good and and provides nice grip. 6.Battery : There is some contradiction the site says it is 3120mah but the phone box says it is 3030mah.Not sure what exactly the capacity is. Still I think the battery is good enough and will be giving ample backup. Verdict : Can't say much have to use the phone for about a month to actually get to know the exact standby etc. new batteries rarely cause any issue 7.Defect : Please check the phone thoroughly for any defects.I was disappointed when I used the phone at night and found light coming from a place where it should not be coming from. Below the capacitive buttons at the phone's bottom. I mean it is like the phone is not thoroughly packed or sealed though again the box has QC Checked. Overall the package is good but guys check the product thoroughly as soon as you receive it.I already made a request for replacement hoping I would be a happy customer soon from a disappointed one.
0|3|I have received phone within said period. It is amazing and best phone with these features. but i have found that this phone has weak sound quality,,,, such low sound even if you set setting to full. hard to hear and ring when there is incoming calls. I am giving three star for all features, fast access, great touch and light weight. deducted two stars for sound quality.
0|3|The phone itself performs as expected,most of the shortcomings are clearly given in the description and reviews so no stars lost for that The SOLE reason its a 3 star and not 5 is that there is an undisclosed limitation, where this phone does not allow for a PIN of more than 4 digits. Many corporates require a longer PIN, Android supports it, yet Mi4i does not. None of the popular reviews point this out, the product description does not either, so keep in mind, a PIN more then 4 digits is NOT supported
1|1|I had placed order for Xiomi Mi4i mobile on Flipkart website and was delivered in record time of 4 days. I was so happy to receive the consignment well packed and looked forward to its usage immediately after having read the product information published on the Flipkart website. While the phone looks very cute and weighs very less, I tried the BSNL micro SIM card. The handset took a longtime to boot and ultimately I was thrilled to see the screen lit up brightly. While the connectivity tower glowed to the full I wanted to test for the Data connectivity. Alas, it was a big disappointment! The handset could not detect the 2G/3G signals despite my trying all sorts of adjustments in the Settings. Even tried the SIM of Airtel but no improvement at all as regards the Data connectivity. Occasionaly there was a flash of the 3G connectivity which disappeared as quickly as it appeared. I read the review of other purchasers and noted that they are also facing the same problem of non detection of 2G/3G signals by the handset. I wonder whether it will pick up 4G signals at all as I can do not intend to switch to 4G immediately. I have requested for replacement which Flipkart is yet to accept as they would like to discuss with me before accepting the replacement order. I wonder why we should go through all this ordeal of booking in advance and then wait for the countdown till 2pm only to be saddled latter with such useless handset. Will Flipkart arrange for immediate replacement as it is within their return policy?.

0|5|I have bought more than 10 devices of MI from flipkart. All are good. Specially this is very good for 13k. Build quality is very good and very light weight and we can easily use it in single hand.
0|4|Got this on first flash sale.Will come directly to the point as specs are clearly mentioned. 1.No Heating issue : Please update the software , around 800Mb, and it should be fine , had updated as soon as I got phone.I did not experience any heating issu not sure why many people have commented that. 2.Phone easily runs for 1 day (Full day 3g + around 6hrs of WIFI + 3hrs of Future Fight game + 3-4 hrs of browsing(screen time)) 3.There is some lag in UI, and after having the screen guard on (unofficial), it becomes unresponsive. Waiting for the original Screen Guard , will update once I get that. 4.Call Quality,looks and the sound output when connected to headphones are awesome. Phone speaker is not that great actually below average. Overall very good phone at this range. Cannot expect more at 12,999k. If you are planning to buy phone for less than 20k this one has no competition.
0|5|There were two reasons I ordered the phone, the promising 13MP camera and the FullHD display and man am I impressed. The camera is top notch in every way, be it picture quality or other features! It even has a manual mode! The flash works pretty well, giving out the same results that a DSLR would give in low light. Without the flash, though, there is quite a bit of noise which can be compromised with. The selfie camera is also very good, the pictures are comparable to those from iPhone. The display is brilliantly crafted as well. Perfect colors, size and lighting. To add to these, the battery is quite long lasting, the body is slim and sleek, the sound quality is good (speaker isnt too loud, but very clear), and the UI is beautiful (takes one day to get around, but you'll love it). To sum it up, you cannot get a more sophisticated, value for money device for this price. Cheers Xiaomi. Waiting for my freebie screen guard!
1|4|Excellent over all performance , major limit is there is no memory expansion option, only 12.23 gb space is available for user, Expecting next model of same with memory expansion
0|5|I received phone on 6th May ..first of all i Charged it to 100% then i installed OTA update 6.5.3.0 which i Pre-downloaded on my PC & Clear Cache in Mi recovery . then i installed all Apps & check All Apps working. i have no Problem No Heating , No Lagging , only one Minus Point Speaker Sound is bit low ...but for me its enough. Pros. 1. 5-inch smartphone ,compact, slim, lightweight 2. extra bright display, the slim OGS glass panel and the Sunlight Display 3. Performance: Fast but not optimal 4. Camera: Impressive! high quality sensors, fast response excellent HDR Cons. 1 . storage issue only 16 GB 2. Low Sound output I recommend it to Buy everyone , i dont recommend it for Power Users
0|5|Its awesome phone . Pros :- Display is awesome 4G Battery And design Phone quality is excellent . Cons :- Low memory no expandability But if we have a otg pen drive its okay . With blind u can go for it ... This is my first review I never written reviews .this phone and its quality made me to write .... I am fully satisfied with it ...
1|5|Little heating issue in this phone bt aftr update it will resolve... Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly.
0|3|I got this phone few days back and was excited to experience an affordable beast. With a single day use I was fully satisfied with the performance until I turned on the Primary Camera to shoot some pictures and videos. The camera is average quality but the biggest issue is the camera software, it has the "Slow Motion" feature to capture and view the recorded video in slow motion. But it has bugs and most of the times you will get a black screen or blinking black/white screen while using this feature. I immediately reported this to flipkart and they arranged a replacement. But I don't think a replacement will work because the other Mi 4i phone my brother-in-law received has exactly the same issue making me believe that the whole lot is defective. I hope Xiami fixes this issue by pushing a software update ASAP. i will give 5 stars to this product if the camera issue is fixed.
1|2|Mi4i a brilliant product and as claimed a flagship. Really reminds me of iphone instantly the moment you switch it and use it. All said and done , beautiful specs, light weight etc....the problem is you cant hold it for long. It heats tremendously. Big problem with the phone. You simply cant use it. So a dilemma, what to do ? You like to keep such a phone but you are not able to keep it. If these guys can make good this issue, its a fabulous phone to have and makes a statement.
0|5|I searched lot of mobile phones before buying it and would like to say that it is really a awesome awesome mobile phone produced by Xiaomi. I bought this mobile on 30th of April and it got delivered to me on 4th of May via standard ekart delivery. The moment I opened the box I observed a wow factor. I am using this mobile from last 3 days very rigorously with both the SIM's active and 3G on all the time on second SIM and getting a very decent battery life around more than one day easily (although I am not a heavy gamer but using rest all the features like fb,chat, emails, web browsing, camera shots, wifi, Bluetooth etc.) As far as the mobile display is concerned I haven't seen any display as good as this one even in a 20K price range. Phone slightly heats up during heavy use but it is not something which is not manageable. Phone feels very premium in hand and very easy to operate with only one hand. MIUI 6 is having many useful features and customization which you will not find in any stock Android. I was using Samsung S4 before it and trust me this phone is lot better than that even it is half of it's price. Guys if you are looking for some mobile in 15-20K price range then go for this one instead and trust me you will not regret..
0|4|Well, this is an edit over my previous review. I received the product on 5th May, 2015 & using it since. And I was very angry at that time because the phone has no native video calling option. Later, I found that from Android KitKat 4.4.4, native video calling option was removed from Android. So here's my honest review about the product. Phone is good, light weight, great display, good amount of RAM, good front camera, battery charges quick & lasts more than 1 day. Phone is bad, it gets warm, but that's not called heating. No expandable memory option, tried lots of OTG thumb drives, but doesn't support all, rear camera is not up to the mark. After purchasing the phone, I went through online reviews & comparisons of this phone to other phones with same configuration, & found that this is the best phone amongst them in almost every department. Maybe in a few weeks, there might be a winner over Mi 4i. But till then, why not enjoy the moment? And please do update your phone's firmware. I did myself & found lot of performance & heating issue resolved over these updates. Current updated firmware version is 6.5.6.0, & my phone doesn't even get warm like it used to. Hope I might able to help you taking decision over buying this phone with this review. Thank you.
0|5|Well, as many of you might have posted about the 11gb of storage space out of the 16gb, I personally feel that if you know a bit of data management, it will very useful to manage the storage issue. On top of that yiou get a hell lot of space in the cloud to archive your data. The simple option of OTG helps to reduce the pain of carrying heavy and bulky files on the device. Using the device for roughly 3 days has given me a fair amout of idea about the basic features and the MIUI has helped me customise the device according to my needs. The phone has not yet got a charge post a full charge day before yesterday. I am still having about 46% juice left at this point of time when I am typing the review. Camera is superb, both the selfie and the rear! The new feature of sunlight display really works when using the device outdoors. Overall a great device with a great battery and superb processor speeds. I am not a gaming person, so I do not have complints from the heating perspective. PROS: camera battery life processor MIUI android lollipop sound reproduction CONS: didnot notice any yet!
1|1|I would rate it to 2.5/5 when compared from the overall aspects: Heat Issue: The backside of the gadzet goes for a toss while on Internet Connection via Mobile Data \ Wifi. Voice Recording: The recorded sound is quiet low when it comes to relisten the recorded Voice/ Interview. Camera: The precision is not scaled up to the mark on default parameters when it already has so high Camera lens capacity. Space \ Capacity: By default the new handset shows 10.5 GB Free space out of 16 GB which is quiet surprising when really checked in actuals.
1|2|Everything is great and near perfect but phone heats to extreme even in standby mode and while charging. Haven't installed any app but will review after using some games and apps.
1|5|Best mobile.Battery life is good. No heating problem. Downloading was very good while installing apps compared to other mobiles. Photo clearity is best.
1|5|I have good experience of 2 Mi phones, still I was little cautious while ordering Mi 4i. But I was surprised once I received the phone. It is very light weight and smaller in size. All the Pros given by Mi as well as others stand true, so I will not talk about it again. I will say it is a good phone for a given price point, though price is little higher. Price should be little lower, 11999/- or Mi Band should be given along with the phone. In fact, I will discuss cons (or not positive points) in detail. - Screen size: 4.92 inches as against claim of 5 inch. But then PPI is increased, which is good!! - AnTuTu Benchmark score: 39540 marginally less as against claim of 40253 - Sim card tray is not of good quality - Memory: 16 GB. Internal storage: 11;9 GB, available is 9.4 GB (I feel Mi should increase the built-in memory) - I observed little heating at the back cover. But cant argue with it. Only metallic bodies can disseminate heat faster. Most of the new phones bound to have heating problem. - RAM: 2 GB. Available RAM is less than 1 GB - Non-removable battery
1|5|i was using the phone from past 2 days . have seen lotz of guys writing reviews regarding heating. yeahh the phone heats but not heavy (u need to update the software to latest version {{{ MIUI 6.5.3.0(LXIMICD) |STABLE }}} then the issue got resolved TO SOME EXTENT ) and the display 441 ppi was amazing 13 mp and 5mp are awesomne u'l be getting good shots and one con is no memory card but no issue i can manage with out memorycard and i'l update the complete review soon tq shadulla
0|5|Very good phone . 1) Battery is outstanding. 2) No lags 3) rear camera is good . front camera is Outstanding. ( I have got a maximum number of like when I posted a selfie taken from its front cam :) ) 4) touch is very good 5) extremely light weight 6) very elegant looks . But its a bit slippery (it doesn't matters as anyways one is going to buy a flip cover for it) 7)10.5 gb of memory ( fair enough for me) 8) only issue is the Heating issue. But I Can live with it. In fact I have now started using it as a phone and also for ironing my clothes ;) . Verdict- If you can live with a bit of heating Problem ( Its not that much as people have exaggerated), Then u should surely go for it.
0|3|Just got mi 4i. initially at strting steps it started to heat up, and believe me you wont like to hold your phone. then during operations it lagged sometime, during charging it was heating, durin calls it was heating. its like a heating machine. Pros : premium look. really awesome display, similar to iphone displays. touch very simple and smooth. performance is good enough but heats a lot. cons : heating and only heating. low speaker sound cant hear from beyond 7-10 meter. if you want only good screen buy it. if you dont want to hurt youself during light phone use then dont buy it. it heats a lot and i mean it.i was unable to operate. no and headphones.
0|4|nice phone bt mine had problem in speaker when ever i plug in usb ,the sound in phone internal speaker reduced basically the speaker connections were faulty requested a return
0|5|My first MI phone, Best design, Best quality product, High performance in low price, I love this phone, It's really awesome.........
0|4|i ordered on the first sale and got delivered on Saturday itself thanks for flipkart fast delivery after switching on the mobile i noteced that the backlight of the menu key not working then i requestewd for a replacement and it also deleverde in 2 days this one is perfect my overall rating ,for phone is 4 star only if they had micro sd card slot i would definetly give 5 star
0|5|Thanks flipkart 4 such an amazing phone... in mid range price. I got my package yesterday and was bit worried when i saw reviews about its heating problem.. I found this phone very smooth and there was a lil bit heating but as i updated the phone i found this phone very cool.. guys go for it... Bit disappointed as there was no screen gaurd in the box..
0|4|I have been using the phone for 2 days (and almost non stop, as you guys know hows with a new gadget, installing apps and exploring) It's not getting more warm than any other smartphone out there. Every smartphone gets a little warm on moderate to heavy use; as simple as that. I have been facing issues with the Onedrive app, i.e. files won't open. It constantly shows no network connection. Thats just for this one app. Apart from that the phone works good as expected (Its not iPhone 6 or Galaxy 6). Personally I prefer Google Now Launcher over the standard launchers of each manufacturer. Camera is very good, not great (I was using Lumia 920 earlier, am missing the camera already).
0|5|Hello guys This is the perfect phone in 5 inch display in this price range. Having an awesome display with performance, battery life, smooth touch and with a nice camera, you cant get more than this in this price. Yes, it heats a bit if you are a heavy user but not too much and its bearable for what you are getting for 13K. The game play and calls were also smooth. Altogether an awesome phone. Go for it...
0|4|This will be my second best phone after Mi 3. Mi 3 was amazing, great smooth experience. • Mi 4i still is one of the best phone under 15k mark at the moment. • Does heat a bit during gaming and charging but Mi 3 did too but less than this. BTW all high end phones does get warm in similar circumstances and hot Indian weather. • 16 GB is the only con with this phone but works for me, not much into mobile gaming and mobile videos you see, sufficient enough for me. • Camera is just pure awesome, better than the Mi 3. • Processing good but falls short of Mi 3. • Dual 4G stand by is God send for me. Hope Xiaomi provides 32 GB version soon and please provide the cases which were shown in the Mi 4i keynote speech by Hugo. Thanks a lot to Xiaomi and Flipkart.
0|5|Undoubtedly, it is the best smartphone under Rs 13,000 sunlight display is something i have never seen in any phone!! please go for it if you can get it on the next sales on 7th may.. waiting for the mi band flash sales tomorrow at 2.
0|4|bright screen lack of storage (mine came with only 10.5 gb of available storage) processor slower than that on mi3(snapdragon 800) good performance SLIM PROFILE excellent matt finish best value proposition in the segment
0|5|Performance is really good and the screen very clear and crisp. No lags no matter how much you multitask. Sound quality is fine and camera is quite good. This is a killer deal @13k !!!!! ...almost a steal :)
0|4|Hello All, This is the best ever phone i have used till now.. Its user interface is simply superb.. Ok Lets talk about the pros: 1. Display is very crisp 2. User interface is something superb 3. Camera is awesome even in low light condition 4. Battery backup is excellent 5. Style.. something superb 6. Excellent call clarity 7. No lag 8. Touch is so smooth Cons: 1. No earphone, screen guard etc.. in the box is very disappointing. If someone is planning to buy a phone which is value for money.. Then don't have second thought.. Just buy this phone Flipkart: U guys are superb with respect to packing, speedy delivery etc.. Keep it up
1|4|Pros: 5 inch Sun light Display; 2GB RAM;Build Quality; Camera 13MP Rear, 5MP front, Dual Flash Cons: No Ear phones, Avg Sound quality in speaker
0|5|Camera: So damn clear and super fluent.... Performance: Superfast and just awesome Battery life: not tested yet but expecting the same as its all other features are soooo smooth.... Value for money...
1|4|This is one decent mobile you can get for a given price range. Very light in weight, works fast but I noticed that it gets hot after using it for some time. I wanted a phone with a screen size of not more than 5" and which packs a punch. Thanks Xiaomi for offering a phone at such a competitive price. Pros: The design is slick and neat. Front camera is not that great. Light in weight. Good price for the specification. Cons: Gets heated up after using it for some time.( Hope it will be sorted in next update) No memory card slot. Will update the review for performance post I use it for few more days.
0|4|Pros: Front Camera Design & looks Cons: Memory ( 10.58GB ROM & appox.900 MB user space RAM) Some times Heating issues (Hope MI will give some update) High SAR Overall, Just Ok type of mobile for this price.
0|5|I never want to mention about the specs as Flipkart already did it! Flipkart delivered the product in 2 days! When I first booted the phone, as others said, it got heated! But as we use, the phone never gets heated too much except while charging! The display is great! The phone's performance is extraordinary! The MIUI is buttery smooth! No need of extra launchers! PROS: Everything (Camera rocks) CONS: Heating issues
0|4|Just got the product. Awesome delivery by flipkart. Although i bought two from different id's .IDK why they did not deliver the second one. For the time being the phone looks and amazing and the feel is just nonparallel. There are some lags but mostly due to over usage. Will review properly after a while. Worth the money. Buy it
0|1|Defective product deliver. Delivery is also not gud. I takes 20 days to deliver. But in my location it takes 3 to 4 days. When i call customer care they said due to sale days it takes more days. I also buy a phone from snapdeal during sale they takes 4 days to deliver. Very gud very gud snapdeal. Never buy from flipkart
0|1|This phone's normal temperature is about 40 degree celsius(while no apps running) even when the surrounding temperature is 28 degree celsius. The temperature can easily go up to 48 degree celsius if you play games like Asphalt 8 for about 15 minutes. Flipkart's return policy is of no use, so don't think that if you are facing issues like heating or hanging they will return the phone. They have started a long procedure in which they will check your phone through an app and say that your phone has no issue. Then they will ask you to get a validation from Mi service center that the device is faulty. Mi service center will change your MiUI (6.6.10 to 6.4.10, if you think it is update!!) and the device will start heating abnormally which is fine from Mi point of view because they consider temperatures only above 50 degrees as abnormal temperature. So, if you think 45-50 degree is normal temperature then go for Mi 4i.
0|1|gets heated up with just 2 mins of normal use. You use this as an Iron BOX . Very disappointed. Pros: 1) amazing specs 2) New UI Cons: 1) Heats like a iron box 2) FlipKart return Policy... Ufff executive keeps rejecting the return sating smart check application doesn't show anything . we have to xioami service center for some stupid acknolewdge.. Than they will approve.. Veryyyy Disappointed with Flipkart!!!
1|1|Got my Mi4i this evening. Pros: Excellent responsive touch. Sharp and crisp images. Above par camera. Reasonably fast. Cons: No headset. Problems faced: Heating on the top, making it uncomfortable to ear. O/g calls do not get connected, and get dropped with a ping. Sometimes, call gets connected. No pattern was observed. My o/g success rate is less than 20%. Tried calling numbers in my home itself. If this continues, may have to return the phone. I/c calls issue is there. It says "phone switched off" even when the phone is on. In both cases, signal strength was showing FULL. Tried setting in 3G mode overriding default LTE mode, but to no avail. This can be verified from my call history, which I have not erased. I have chosen to return the mobile and ask for refund of money.
1|1|I got this phone on saturday and observed the following issues. 1. Phone heats up on net usage. 2. Response leg is observed overall phone's response is similar to Lenovo A6000. 3. Gaming: The worst part on this phone. I installed Subway Surfer and I am unable to play as it got stuck many time during running. Overall gaming is not smooth even my older phones are better than this. 4. Display is crisp and clear I will give only 1 star for its display.
0|3|i check that antu benchmark score 1 time 38k after that 2 time score 20k phone is too much heating not bear that hand front camera is extraordinary display is awesome everybody did not believe that beat note 4 display i have it also said display is awesome build quality excellent very compact slim over heating issues most important thing operating system is 64 bit if you bear heat can u buy it battery backup excellent in the day heavy use video recording excellent quality wifi browsing no get heat 3g use get heat wheal use camera & game play get too much heating software design also super many option is there only heat issue
0|5|At first I would like to say Im a geek and im too much into tech and all so this review is heavy This phone is great in terms of features.good product, very slim and weight less....................................
0|5|I got this phone 2 days after booking. I'm happy with the design, Display, Camera and I didn't see any heating issues like many have mentioned. It is the best phone in it's class. Just go for it.
1|1|Yes a big loss. bought this phone on the occassion of big billion day and like the other three devices i bought from Flipkart i.e Lenovo A6000 plus, Mi4i and Ambrane Powerbank all the devices turned out to be defective now pursuing after the so called easy return policy, hopefuuly some good will be done to the loss caused to me. sincere request do not risk your money here. if i get money refunded i shall not hesitate to thank by rewriting a review.
0|5|Brilliant phone at this price. Pros: 1.Display: Best Display any device can provide under 20k. Colors are very natural and specially in sunlight(Sunlight display is incomparable to any device). 2.Camera: Both Rear and Front Camera take brilliant shots. Colors are very natural and very less noisy even in low-light. Dark room flash shots are above expectation. The Dual-tone flash just works perfect. Video: Video recording is also up to the mark. 3.Design & Built: The best design for a 5 inch phone. Very decent and comfortable to hold. Doesn't slips from hand at all and gives a premium look. 4.Gaming: Very good high end gaming experience. 5. Call Quality: Call quality on this device is just brilliant. 6.Audio: Audio output from speaker is pretty decent. With earphones sound is very good. Cons: 1. Missing external SD Card Support. (The biggest con) 2.Performance: Performance is very good in Performance mode but very slightly glitchy in Balanced mode just sometimes. Still looking at the price to performance ratio it's pretty decent. 3.Audio output from speaker is a little low. NOTE: This review is after the latest firmware update MIUI 6.5.6.0:- which solves all the heating issues while gaming. Great buy at 13k.
0|5|People, Bought this phone for my bro on the first ever sale of Mi4i! I use Mi3 which was bought in its first sale back in Jun14 !! Since then I am big Mi-fan...BUT I dont think its biased review. I am writing this after almost a month & based on my bro's feedback. Nokia design/build quality, iOS like fluid UI and an Android at heart!!! What else you want??? Excellent display - 5/5 Great build quality & form factor - 5/5 Super performance (except few lags due to new Miui on Lollipop, I am sure it will be fixed in future updates; bcoz I have seen Miui6 on Redmi Note without such lags in balanced mode) And this is 64-bit processor, so once all apps are tuned for 64-bit then phone will rock - 4/5 Camera is just excellent! HDR & other effects works as miracle - 5/5 Heating issue & speaker volume issue has been fixed with latest 71mb update! (btw all phones with high cores & bigger battery heats its natural; even old dual-core laptops heats!!) -5/5 Battery is simply superb...every morning 30-40% still left with full time 3G on & decent use of all basic apps daily. -5/5 VFM (value for money) ..it blows away competition. Made in China is getting redefined. Seriously motog only sells for brand name & zenfone for size :) ...Otherwise the specs & quality wise this is just great piece of hardware. - 5/5 Last but not least! Its sin if I dont mention MiUI ... Use it to believe it! This is 'The Best' form of Android in market right now. It has hell lot of features, daily you will discover new one! Miui tips & tricks:: http://en.miui.com/thread-47569-1-1.html This is just tip of an iceberg... And also more features are added with every update in 1-2 months! -- 10/5 ;) My Conclusion: If budget is less than 20k then just order Mi4i! And if your budget is more than 20k then wait for Mi Note :)) Thanks for reading!
0|5|Giving a clear and practical review after using for 3 weeks continuously. Firstly I would like to give the Tips for the existing and upcoming users as it will help you more than reading the reviews. 1. If you get the phone with MIUI 6.5.3 update kindly update it to 6.5.4 asap. It will completely reduce all the heating issues. Otherwise you will feel the phone a fry pan. 2. After receiving peel off the company fitted matte screen protector and place a 8-9H tempered screen guard as the phone doesn't have gorilla glass. 3. Dont try to take pics with manual mode until you know it well. 4.Use a hard back case for keeping away the phone form dust,oil. Still the phone has rubber washable nano finish back but it is recommended to use a back case. 5.Don't access "permission manager". If you turn on the permission manager on many app features will be hidden. 6. Try to off WIFI and mobile data as per your convenience for better battery backup and low heating of the phone. 6.Dont use any launcher instead try to apply the themes available in MI themes. 1. Look and comfortability Mi 4i is the slimmest phone in this range I can challenge. When you hold only the phone without any cover it will give you 1005 comfort to hold it for long times, When in call it is also very comfortable to hold the phone. Its trendy white and black combination gives an mind blowing stylish look. 2. Performance I mainly do internet surfing,little bit gaming,photography,music and youtube. After doing all these things it gives a super 24 hour backup. I only charge once in a day. Coming to its octa core processor. Truly it has a superb speed of performance. It hardly gets hanged with the lucid combination of 2gb RAM and 8 core processor. 3. Camera Its 13MP cam is truly 13MP. You can compare the images taken in daylight with A DSLR clicked image. Its front 5MP cam is just superb for taking selfies. Video quality is very good. But please don't click with manual mode untill you are not so accustomed to click picture in manual mode. It will give you a bad impression of the camera. 4.Network Network reception is too good. It will give you the best 3g experience. Mobile data service is promptly switched on after you on the option. 5.UI The MIUI 6 based on Android L is very good. Unlike the pure android versions you will get many more inbulit features for which you have to install 3rd party apps. Like-junk cleaner,app lock and many more. 6.Sound The sound output is quite low but clear. You will get clear ans bass full sound in headphone. But if you listen songs only in phone then it is little bit low. 7. Display The full HD IPS display will give you best out of your videos,movies. Display is very very clear. But it should have Gorilla glass 3. You will get much more than what you are paying. Go ahead for the phone if you are looking for a handy,sexy,performance mi-budget phone.
1|1|I purchased Mi4i with understanding its popularity, but i lost my all happiness on receiving mobile, Mobile's highest ringer volume is very low. I can not hear any ringtone with highest volume setting if mobile is placed more than 1 ft from my ear. I never come to know that whether somebody is calling on my mobile if mobile is placed just 1 to 2 feet away from me. After contacting service centre, i got reply that it is just default speaker with volume level, and that cannot be changed. even after changing the speaker, volume will not increase. so if your hearing capacity is higher than only buy Mi4i. It is impoosiible to hear ringer, if you are in Traffic, in public place etc.I wanted to return the phone to flipkart as per return policy, but that is also denied sayting that there is nothing wrong with instrument.
0|1|I can not think xiaomi will give such a poor glass quality. I got the mobile on 11th May. As n When i open the box mobile dropped from just 1ft height and display glass gone and lower panel touch not responding. I complained on flipkart as well as xiaomi customer care about this and they said we can not help, you have to go service centre to get repair at your on cost. Which type of gorilla grass is it that can break easily. When i called to service centre they said because this mobile is in new launch they have not accessory for this talk to again customer care even both dont know the cost of broken glass. I have seen apple, samsung, noika etc if glass broken some how than there whole touch panel work as earlier before broken. This is not single case. In my office 2 Mi3 mobile display also broken due to fall and touch gone out. And their screen repair cost is very high (Rs. 6000). If I am spending 13000 for Mi4i and i Got such a sensitive mobile than it is worst mobile. I strongly not suggest to purchase such a cheap mobile.
1|5|At first reviews got me scared but still I purchased it and when I got this phone my first attempt was the latest update and then there is NO HEATING ISSUE. however the chipset is designed in such a way that it gets heat up but only after much use of this phone. I mean the regular use. There's nothing to worry, every smart phone get heated up even the big budget phone like S6 edge gets heated up. People on flipkart are throwing bullshit there's noting like it I say Spolier Alert - No Heat after the update. I am reviewing this product because of the non-sense that people are talking about.
0|1|Its no doubt a good looking, better specification and slim Mobile. But has some critical issues. 1. Heating problem :- Heating starts without using any app or voice etc. Just by keeping in pocket, sometimes you feel it starts heating. 2. Notifications issue. : Dont get Notification updates on Apps like Times of India, NDTV news feed etc. Also on Whatsapp "No Notification' many times, and as soon you open the app, hell loads of messages starts pouring, whiche were send earlier by your contacts. So very disappoiting issue. 3. Net Data problem. 4. Hangs many a times. 5. Reboots its own without even using it. 6. Many a times gets hanged and no button or touch works, you need to just watch foolishly and this becomes a piece of Crap. :-( Annoying device.
0|3|After using 6 days, I am writing this review. First thing is,there is no expandable memory option. SO before purchasing you decide about memory requirement for you. only 10.81 GB available for the users. Pros: Build quality is good... Front camera is good... Awesome Display ... Cons: Rear Camera not good as expected... I am not feeling like Battery is 3140Mah. With normal usage We can manage one day. I have seen only 1GB free Ram available. .. Bit Heating Issue.... I felt very bad for this : Flipkart not accepting return. I applied for return within 24hours of product received. Dear flipkart please accept the return request from the customers. If the customer not satisfied with the product what can he do with that product.? You people not working for customer satisfaction. Snapdeal will refund the amount if customer is not satisfied with the product.
0|5|I was in a dilemma reading reviews of fellow buyers in flipkart about heating issues. I still went ahead and bought it. Guess what.. NO REGRETS what so ever. I bought the phone in second flash sale and it was delivered in exactly 24 hrs. Kudos to flipkart. About the phone as mentioned i updated it once i got my hands on it and am using it with wifi uninterrupted and no signs of heating. Use the phone in BALANCED MODE and everything should be fine. Camera works great. And i have to mention about the battery life. It easily lasts over a day with regular usage. Happy with service and phone. Recommend it!
1|1|The phone is heating like anything. Flipkart is not responding properly. Only gaining time by giving missed calls every day. we can not call back the number again. They say 45 degrees heat is common. Did anybody bear that much heat while answering the calls... with in a minute the "ear" burns. FLIPKART DO SOMETHING..... before we loose patience...
1|2|I get ONN the phone yesterday, it gets soo heat inside 2-3min , I get surprises & feared , I power off 1hours ,ONN then its heat is decreases little, I cant understand why such happens, How Xiomi has made such item for india.? Mr Hugo Barra says that Mi 4i is for India during the lunching , but such heating issue disappoints me or Indian Mi fans so much, Visual IVR I cant found. Camera is goood, RAM flows 1GB , only available 880-900Mb without instal any app. Mi 2 - runs its 65% RAM, Mi 4i even 2Gb but runs 110-120% ,with No apps installed -only 800mb RAM avails . Built is good, slim, average looks , I wants to solve the heating issue to my Mi 4i , and RAM fluids issues ,Camera ,MIUI 6 , other are manageable and good . updates showing 806Mb, i am not doing that. Dear flipkart /Xiomi Plz suggest me ,solve this or take the phone and refund my valuable money.
0|3|I am start using this phone. phone is good.but camera is not of 13 MP. Samsung phone's camera are much better than this. light weight phone, slim body, when u start it, it will update for android Lollipop version. Accessories are not available like back cover, tempered glass etc. In total good phone but its cost is more.
1|5|- Received it yesterday - 4th May evening. - Brilliant screen clarity and touch. - Very light to hold. - Does look like a premium phone. - No issues with Camera - front & back. - Loud speaker is crisp and loud. Not louder than an iPhone 5s & above. - Does heat a little on surfing/ whatsapp calling, which phone doesn't. - MIUI6 is highly flexible. Lollipop features are not visible in OS. - Clear voice calls/ reception. - Matt White back panel. Will not slip from hand. My 2 cents is to go for it as the HW configuration offered at this price is worth the price.
0|5|Best mobile in Mi Family. Stunning clarity with 441 PPI and best in class configuration with 64 bit snapdragon 2nd Gen Processor. But eKart guys are really worthless they don't know how to treat a customer delivery. I was waiting for 2 hours for my product on weekend but the guy who suppose to deliver me the product promised me that he will deliver me withing half and hour but after that he never picked up my call. So guys do always COD and get the product and pay for it...
0|4|Received this phone yesterday. Very good screen; Camera is great; Very light weight; Finishing looks good; Call quality is awesome and crystal clear. No heating issue seen in normal usage. Somewhat disappointed by the less sound volume while playing music. No SD card support- but on board memory is workable for day-to-day use. USB OTG is supported. Would rate at - 4.5/5.0 Great value for money! If you are looking for a good value for money phone then go for it.
0|4|Very good product with Awesome looks and nice build quality.. And nice Camera.. Regarding Heating Issue .. Guys Please note it this is Summer Season and normal temp is around 39.. I have used it whole day today in AC I haven't found anything like that Thanks
1|5|Received in good condition. A little beast with All Great Features. Works like Solid machine. All apps are smooth like Butter.
0|4|I bought this phone on first flash sale held on 30-04-2015. On screen every thing looked absolutely amazing and when i ordered on this day(30-04-2015) the expected delivery date was 8th of May but i got it on 3rd of May AWESOME. What i liked about this phone: 1.) Screen size and display quality.====== 9/10. 2.) Processor octacore 1.7/1.1 ghz. ======7/10. 3.) Battery 3120 mah. ================8/10. 4.) Quick Charge tech. ===============8/10. 5.) Sunlight Display.=================9/10. 6.) Camera========================9/10. Updated the marks of camera to "9" i feel this performs way better. But still i think at the price of 12999/-, MI4I should be shipped with atleast a standard handsfree.
1|5|Reviews based on 3 days of usage: - First thing you will notice is very light in weight - Display is super - Butter smooth touch - MIUI6 has lot of features. - Got update on the very first day though a big one of 800MB. - Battery is great. - Even 5 inch screen is so easy to handle. Phone do get heated up if used extensively but not very much that we can't use. Ram availability is also little bit less that is 1GB approx. Overall till now, satisfied with the Phone as per my requirements.
0|5|Excellent OS and camera both front and back. Don't Dont feel like carrying a mobile such a light weight. Awesome design. Looks stilish. One con's is no expandable memory. Heating is also bearable that's common in today's smart phones. Just go for it you will be very delighted and don't just miss such an unbeatable phone just because of little heating problem
0|4|Got it on 2nd May. writing a review with just one day of usage Pros: Very slim, easy to use by one hand Stunning display, Sharp images Never noticed any heating issue, used camera for long time , it was little warm but it was normal I got a white phone, Back panel is not finger print prone for white and black Front camera is really good, it is really a selfie phone. It shows enhanced image. Few features like swipe to select the front/back camera and the filters are very user friendly ( Overall the camera app is pretty good, lot of features.) sunlight visibility is a good feature, it is pretty noticeable The screen is pretty good, it is less finger print prone. Cons: very low volume - Phone ringing volume is very low call volume in speaker also very low (Normal call volume is good) 13 MP back camera was little low performer when compared with other 13MP cameras ( oneplus ). And other concerns like no expandable memory , no headphone available in the kit which is pretty known. Couldn’t test LTE/battery life and games performance I will give 3 1/2 stars.
0|5|I had a Moto G gen 1 previously. Bought this when I saw the flash sale. After getting used to stock android Lollipop getting acclimatized with MIUI is difficult. Phone gets heated up very quickly especially when you click pictures. The inbuilt apps are taking up too much of RAM. Only 10.89 GB available for use which is a downer compared to 12.9 odd of Moto G. Other than that the phone is pretty fast, compact, bright and weightless. Will get to know better after using it for sometime.
1|5|1.Battery : 70% more than iPhone6. Faster charging than iPhone6 2.Camera : 5MP more than iPhone6's 8MP.. F**cking 13MP 3.Display : Bigger than iPhone6. (iPhone6 = 4.7" Mi 4i = 5.0") 4.Color Gamut : iPhone6 = 72% while MI 4i = 95% 5.Resolution : 420ppi with MI 4i. While iPhone6 has only 326ppi 6.RAM : 2GB for mi 4i.....while 1GB iPhone6 7.Resolution size : 1920 x 1080 Pixels for Mi 4i while 1334 x 750 Pixels for iPhone6 Mi 4i can be the biggest punch for Apple in nearer future. Get ready to see another giant killed by a newcomer. Greatest product on the planet earth. No phone can be as perfect as Mi 4i in this budget. NO HEATING AT ALL. NO LAGGING WHILE PLAYING INJUSTICE, ASPHALT 8 or GTA SAN ANDREAS. I REPEAT NO HEATING AT ALL
0|5|Hi Guys, This rating is based after 36hrs using the phn. Pros:- GREAT LOOKS. At this price its Great. Very Good Performance, NO lags till now. Full HD Resolution Full HD Video Recording Great Camera (both Camera are great) Rear 13MP camera is great & crystal clear pix. Front camera 5MP is also great at this price.

Bigger battery of 3150mah & last long for approx 1.5 days with normal using.

(a little more than normal) Only Mobile and Charger provided in the box. No Screen Guard/ No pouch provided. Stay tuned for more add-on comments after using some more days.. Thanks
1|5|i have compliened product(mi 4i) within 2day flipkart replaced the product,great service from flipkart
0|1|Mi4 I is below average smartphone battery has heating problem camera is worst display is ok don't buy this one
0|1|Flipkart has a wrong policy on return. They place order for delivery to their on firm ekart. And you will not get any phone calls from the courtier boys. They do not delivery and mention in the website that delivery failed. After 3 days they say they are processing for refund, if the item is in good demand. These actions of Flipkart and or Ekart is unilateral. You ahve to pay again and start the entire process once again. It is real pain if the item is through advance registration etc as in the instant case.
0|1|The Phone has lot of heating mere using and browsing of internet make the phone hot , its heating like anything . can i get refund and buy another phone not working for me.
0|1|From the unboxing of this phone it was little heated but i thought because of outside temperature.But when i started using it it heated too much and if i let it in ideal condition with no use it still remain heated.
1|1|Good - 1. Slim phone, pretty handy Bad - 1. It doesn't look like 5 inch screen phone. looks like a cheap brother of redmi 2S 2. Back plastic is the worse and gives a damn cheap look to a phone 3. Camera - doesn't match up with any of 13mp standard. 4. No headphones - seriously xiomi wants us to pay more for buying it. 5. Have had the phone in my pocket for whole day. Missed calls too often. vibrator vibrates like nothing. 6. MIUI 6 is again fools play. Whats the point having android lollipop if you are restricted to customized MIUI 7. Top of it no screen guard. Display screen is easy to get rugged marks. 8. Heating like hot pan 9. Volume is like i am playing my tv on mute status. 10. Lag in overall performance
0|1|guys don't go by comments of Flipkart good phone ,beauty and all... worst phone ever. Keyboard Problem(Sometime you will not able to complete word) Heating Problem Google Play services problem Contact merge( worst functionality which will keep merging your friends and family number) total mixture, its your duty to recognize whose number is this Very poor sound many important Android applications are NOT Supported. even NOT able to update Phone. No service center, there are but for on show off. they will never answer your call. list will go on but this is in short...each functionality have bug inside PLZ PLZ ..don't waste your hard earned money.
0|1|I have four Xiaomi phones,Redmi 1S.Mi3(2phones),Mi4i in my family.Though Xiaomi phones are well built,but there is NO AFTER SALES SERVICE in most of the states.Though software problems are solved easily online,a minor hardware problem renders Xiaomi phone useless,as there is NO AFTER SALES SERVICE.Neither do they respond to repeated email requests for help.This makes XIAOMI phones DISPOSIBLE ITEMS.Think about this factor before opting for Xioami phones.After sales service is as an important factor to be considered for delicate articles like cell phones, which are very prone to accidental damages. Recently Xiaomi has tied up with Gujrat based company QARMATEK for after sale service under the name"Pick Mi service".Whether your phone is under or out of warranty,you have to pay Rs 189 as courier charges(fedex).When your phone reaches to Qarmatek,they call you and for all minor or major defects ask you to pay Rs 9000 minimum,for changing mother board.Even if your phone has a microphone,speaker,camera,or a SIM slot defect,they insist on mother borad replacements on the grounds that they dont have a machine to remove defective mike,speaker or SIM slot.This looks funny.For Rs 9000 you can purchase a brand new high end phone from any Indian compnay with after sale service center everywhere in the country.Just visit www.consumercomplaints.in and see it is flooded with complaints against Xiaomi and QARMATEK.Log into OLEX and see hundreds of Xioami users wishing to sell their brand new Xioami phones but getting no buyers.Take my opinion seriously.I have no bias against any one,but i have faced this problem and it is my social responsiblity to tell you about the consequences of purchasing a Xiaomi phone.
0|1|I have purchased an Mi4i Phone couple of months back. Within few months of purchase, i have faced with several software and hardware issues. Since this is my only handset, i am struggling with my daily phone calls and is definitely looking for a replacement of handset. I never expected such bad and poor quality phones from Xiaomi. I am really frustrated that i have spend a lot of money purchasing this phone. Following are the issues i am facing with my phone: 1. Front Camera Not working - Within one month of purchase, my front camera stopped working. 2.Overheating- My phone gets heated up even on few minutes of continuous use. 3. Blinking Screen- Now, the phone keeps on blinking with vibration without any reason. I could not use my phone. We have tried to reach your customer care by different means, but never got enough support from your side. I dont want to use this complaint stuck phone anymore.
0|1|This phone is the worst ever phone made by Mi for India. Mi the cheap and worse company thinks that the Indians will use these type of cheap and bad phones.Shame on Mi. Phone heating like an hell (exceeds above 52c without using much) ,hanging a lot and restarts every 5-10 minutes . Flipkart , this is your your kind information as well that you are spoiling your name for the sake of this Mi Company. Creating Name & Fame is very difficult in today's world and you are easily spoiling your market for this stupid Mi Company. If possible , stop selling Mi phones or impose a heavy fine on Mi for this hell phones. Why Flipkart is spoiling there market for chinese company. MUST SAY THAT PLEASE DO NOT EVER BUY THIS PHONE .Mi making fool of India nothing else . Abolish Mi products in India
1|1|I purchased this on flipkart electronic sale. this phone still have the heating issue. Sometimes it is too much hot that you can not even hold the phone. Finally Sold the product within a day with a loss of 2000 rs. Summary: Please dont buy Any Xiomi Phone.

0|1|flipkart sent me faulty piece of mi 4i, they took the money from me as well. i requested to return the money or replaced the phone, after 36 hours no reply from flipkart about my request. when called they lie that, technical person had called me but in reality they never attempted to solve the problem, they never call me. after several call they keep on lie that they called me but nobody picking the phone, a white lie , they never called even attempted to call, but still no cooperation from them. Waste mgmt and technical people in flipkart. Everyone please beware of this flipkart... before giving them the money, cross check the full functionality of the phone, if find good , only then give them money or else never give any money to them. Rating must be negative to flipkart .
0|1|i recieved phone but it is only work in a single sim mode , its a dual sim phone after that phone ringing volume is extremely slow and phone lag some time after it has 2gb of ram not recomended phone
0|3|as my title says..it really depends upon your preferences(budget phone, memory, good camera, good music experience,big battery, good screen etc) my preference was ...good camera, big battery and light phone (130-140 gms only), good music experience.. and watching hugo bara video i was preety well impressed...but there is some other side of the story(dislikes dominates)... i have used dis phone for weeks now ...what i liked about this phone is 1. very good screen 2. super duper light phone..very sleek phone 3. cool miui experience..you will never get bored depends upon user preferences 1. for me, 10 gb which is left over on this phone was sufficient ..so no complaints..again depends upon your preference ..if it is a issue for you...think twice... 2. 3120 battery last one day only with internet..sufficient for me.i thought it may last longer..but i m just a internet surfer...no complaints....but with time this may further deteriorate... dislikes 1. Yes, Heating near the ear peace is very annoying..specialy these days(summers),...for winters it may be very cozy..hahaha...when you buy this phone..an miui update will immediately come out..after update found heating to have reduced to large extent as before but very little still prevails...probably i am not experiencing heating as i m not a gamer..no extensive usage..yes i extensively use it for surfing internet...which showed little heating(20 %). 2. very very poor music experience...the volume on this phone is very very low...on headphones you get very low song volume...the speaker on this phone is preety bad, very low volume you get...you definately gona miss some calls just bcoz of this...this is the major reason this phone is not recomendable...probably in making the phone slimer, they have made a compromised on these parameters....redemi 2 speeker is very good as compared to this phone..your phone is a your lifeline...you cant listen songs properly...oo oo....for me ...its a major disappointment... 3. Camera is preety good in day light.. but In low light conditions its very very very noisy... again i am saying ...check your preferences before buying thank you
0|1|This is a very bad phone, friends if you are thinking of buying it do not buy. It heats up if you watch youtube. Leave alone heavy usage like gaming. Even after 20 minutes angry bird did not open. 70 % of RAM always occupied. If you look at the quality of pictures on mi website they are splendid, the pics taken from this phone does not even match 50% of the quality. Overall total disappointment. I don't know why such a good ecommerce people (flipcart) is selling this bad phone?
1|1|Battery is getting discharged rapidly & requires a lot of time to charge along with heating issue... seriously man this is not done.. dont buy Mi4i until all issues are resolved.... I am going for cash back option...
0|5|Its been a day since i had received my Mi4i Ive used Ines, Lumia series mobiles, Sony Xperia mobiles and samsung mobiles I am a normal user (lots of music, videos, chatting, surfing , productivity apps, wifi or 3g 24/7, non heavy game user) First things first Make an OTA update of 800MBs for performance improvements i feel the phone is best suiting my requirements. Design is really good (light weight almost wafer like) Display is a great plus No heating for my use, unless using the phone while charging Charges full in 150 mins Charge stands for 24 hrs with either wifi or 3g on around 10 or more hours of mobile usage (music, videos, chatting, browing n stuff) 900MBs of RAM more than suffices as Ive loaded with lots of Apps (downloaded and preloaded) and phone doesnt hang a bit for 13K this phone is a monster !! I would recommend for anyone who wants very good phone at a decent budget Go for it !
1|2|I have been a mi user for a long time i have used mi3 and redmi 2 and i was happy with there performance. so i ordered a mi4i. o think that this phone is very well built and feels good in hand. but this device has flaws as well so lets talk about pros and cons PROS: 1) Feels nice in hand 2) display is beautiful. CONS: 1) This device hangs a lot even on day to day use age i was able to hang this device. 2) If you are a gamer don't go with this as it drops a lot of frames and lags a lot even on leos fortune i noticed some lag. 3) using this phone outside your house is difficult as it tends to become really hot and becomes difficult to hold. even indoor this phone heats up a lot if you play games or do multitask during charging. 4) speaker output is not up to the mark for ME . ( but that's a personal choice.) ALL IN ALL I WONT SUGGEST THIS PHONE FOR BUYING. AT THIS TIME AND UNTIL THEY RESOLVE THE HEATING ISSUE AS IT BECOMES PAINFUL TO HOLD SOMETIMES NEAR THE CAMERA MODULE...
1|1|Phone gets heated up very much around the camera and the call speaker area just after slight usage. Good phone for the price except the heating issue, Camera is good not great, perfect size to handle. Best phone in this price, Xiaomi has to fix this heating issue.
0|5|Great build quality with good hardware specification. overall Great Deal for 12,999/- you must have this phone.
0|5|I got my MI 4i yesterday. people are complaining heating problem. Luckily i don't see any heating problem in my device it is just perfect. If u r heavy gamer all phone will heat including Iphone. I just fell in love with the looks of the mobile its so light and slim super sexy i loved it. Mi 4i runs so perfectly with my 4G sim. If you have a 4G sim you will enjoy the best with the speed and with my 3G sim it gave me little glitches last night but it is running as good as 4G now. May be it needs time to settle down with the network. Main camera is awesome just like some high end mobile camera. Front camera with the beautify feature it will make you look so handsome, i just loved it my marks in my face does appear if you turn on beautify mode :) i will give 6 out of 5. i am giving 1 extra for its beauty.
1|5|after using for more than 3 days and updating to latest miui (Which took almost an hour or two i dont know why?) , it seems phone is not heating too much but still it has heating issues no doubt but only the upper half gets heated. if you are not so into gaming you will not notice . OVER ALL 5 / 5 FOR FEATURES 5 / 5 FOR LOOKS 5 / 5 FOR 1080p DISPLAY 5 / 5 FOR CAMERA 4 / 5 FOR HARWARE (for heating issue, but i dont care almost every phone gets heated be it samsung ,htc etc.)
0|5|good phone.....nice interface....camera was excellent.....but the problem is heating thing..... overall it is worth for that price.... highly recommended..
0|5|Tdy i received this phone, it is awesome phone all in one in less price.touch,display,battery backup is vry gud.
0|4|Pros: 1.Great Camera 2.Amazing screen 3.Decent Gaming performance 4.Premium feel 5.Slim 5.Supports 4G Cons: 1.Slight Heating issue(whlie charging nad 3g internet data usage)
0|4|A very good crafted super slim phone. I'm using it for more than 24 hours. It has a big heating issue. Phone heats up like hell during 3g use around camera and ear speaker region. You cannot even call for 5 mins over voip. Pros: Premium look in 13k. good camera quality both rear and front. UI is good but consumes around over 1 gb ram. No lag till now.(I'm not a gamer. :P) Cons: Heating issue. Even on normal use phone gets warm.Tough to handle long calls like on whatsapp. I observed it takes considerable amount of time to charge through laptop.(but OK) Overall phone is very good except heating issues. Snapdragon 615 had this issue in past too. Hope Xiaomi will launch some patches to get over it. :)
0|4|Pls work on the software and make it more lag free. It's an amazing software Whig require some bug fixes
1|1|I don't want to talk about any specifications or any product related info,. I just want to highlight the policy and qulaity standards of Flipkart and MI. I got the phone on very first flash sale and i am glad that i am happy to got that. Here the delivery was delayed. I didn't have any issues with that, i thght may due to heavy orders. First week: It's fanstatic no doubt at all about the product. Second week: Back button is not working properly. Third week: Battery is draining so fast. Fourth week: Front camera is not working properly. Performance lags (I am not talking hifi performance the basic functionality is lagging) The pathetic quality of MI and poor service of Flipkart makes my buy regret. Ya i know i have 1 year warranty and service center guys can deal with the issues. But its exactly a month old phone and why a new phone will suffers with that problems??? I called flipkart to replace, they said "its been more than a month so we can't replace it acc to our policy, come on dude its only 4 days more than 1 month, grow up i am not asking after 2 or 3 months later. Rules are meant to be broken. I know this is slightly exaggerating. But a person who spends 3 months of research on what to buy and spent 13k is to buy this cheap product...??? My first smartphone is also from flipkart (Nokia Lumia 520), for which i also got some issues and that they replaced, and i used for almost 2 years. But what lesson i learnt is the policy of flipkart sucks and the quality of MI is poor
0|3|Phone hangs regularly after 1 month, Still 7 Gb Balance and not major gaming use, just normal browsing and whatsapp use
0|5|i brought this darling for 9500 in offer on flipkart. and within a month i brought 3more .the phone is very smooth and no lags. it always ready to do anything. the camera is superb. the clarity and the softness in pictures are awesome. it is playing full hd videos without any lag. the battery back up is satisfied. i am a moderate user and i dont play games in mobile. and i use internet all the day dialy one charge is enough. the wifi connnectivity is superb. it is very slim and well degined and perfectly fit in one hand. display is great. cons: no external memory......
0|4|I love this phone.. all features are working very fine . No point of getting hang on..till. Battery is superb... Camera quality is perfect in its section of 13 mp. The only factor I like to get improve is - there should have been one memory card slot too ..or else should be having internal space of atleast 64MB.
1|5|I have used yureka, xperia z, z1, and heating issue is not even felt a fraction of abv phones . honestly no heating issue faced till today. Awsm camera quality like every mi phones. 1gb free ram after update . slim sleek and light weight. Awsm display . sound little less than redmi 2. And I got 45789 score in antutu benchmark. Really a cool phone. Loudspeaker and sensors can be caliberated in about phone > kernal versions > press 5 times so many complaints of it can be solved easily. It's not complaint of phone.
0|4|Only issue is heating. If MI fixs this issue its superb. I am much worried about heating. All other things are fine
0|5|Thanks to both Xiaomi & Flipkart for this amazing phone! Firstly, I got it at almost half the original price (after Diwali discount, old mobile exchange and credit card discount). Thanks to Flipkart for offering such opportunity. Secondly, the MIUI Ver.7 (got updated from 6 to 7 after switching it on) is simply outstanding. I am using it for just over a week and I am satisfied with its performance. Occasionally, I sensed a bit of heat generation, especially after prolong use, which is perhaps true with every mobile handset, but otherwise it is the best bargain among the other mobiles available in the market. Camera is super, selfies are lively. Sound quality is good which I suggest to improve a bit louder, so that it becomes audible when in public. Dual SIM facility is working perfectly. WhatsApp, e-mail, facebook all are running without glitches. What more we want?
0|3|My First Impression with the Mi4i was awesome, when I unpacked it and opened it. I was really impressed with the display quality and slim build. but, soon in 30min. I recognized this has a major issue Heating. I was so impressed with the value and display quality, so before raising a return request I googled about the heating problem with Mi4i, and found that its an known problem with the pone and had a big set back. since I wanted to own and keep this device for a longer period (2yrs). I though to find a solution and soon found that it need some software update and the heating problem will go off. I did the update(Miui 7), and to my surprise the heating problem got reduced significantly. but not gone. but I feel the phones performance went down significantly with the update. I would have given this device 5 star if they can provide a proper fix to this problem. below are my summary about the device: Pros: - Good Display - Call Quality - Price (I got it for 9K). Cons: - Heats up a lot even with casual gaming. - performance and lagging with latest MiUi-7 Update Conclusion, those who are just casual/basic users with not too much of gaming can definitely buy this phone. its really value for money if you get it at my price(9K). else , you should look for other options like Motorola or ASUS in my testing I found ASUS performing faster that Mi4i and with equally good display and call quality. I am still looking for a better solution and hope that the Heating problem can be solved completely without compromising on performance. hope this helps you.
0|1|Front camera blur problem after an update. 2-3 updates came but still Unresolved. Don't buy until this issue is resolved.
0|1|All Mi4i device are facing front camera blur issue after an update. Still Unresolved. I am waiting for another update before going to service center.
0|5|I bought this phone for Rs.10000 only. Very sleek body. Mi4i has very great display. Lightweight phone. But its not premium phone but for 10 to 13k bucks you can get one. But for this price range its the best buy. Battery is good. Cons: But this mobile has heating problem when play cpu intensive games like FIFA. But it doesn't heat on games like Asphalt 8. Camera is of average quality of pics taken it night. In my opinion this phone it the best buy for this price range. Heating problem is not that grave. So if you thinking of buying this mobile and you are gamer then this is the best phone you could buy :)
0|3|Got a shiny little scratch on my screen. :( Chrome app hang/freeze a lot while working on multiple tabs.You can't play HD games its slow down the game speed.
0|3|Ok product. Slim design. Nice display. Good processing speed. Gets heated just after 10min of 3G or 4G usage.
0|4|1. Light weight 2. Slim 3. Good looking 4. Gray color looks premium 5. Brand is cheapest and affordable with best quality. 6. Best camera in that range. 7. Bright and clear display. 8. Good touch response. 9. Lots of accessories available. 10. Aaab kitni tarifen karun. Bas kar rulaega kya? :p Cons: 1. Software is sometimes buggy. But they are fixed with in a time with updates. 2. Worst after sale service. Recommendation: If you are worried about after sale service don't buy. If you want a good phone go for it. Rating: 4/5
0|4|This phone has little bit heating problem..get heated up when playing high graphics games..The camera quality is not as much good as 13mp, There is no slot for external memory card hence 12.2 gb is only availble for use. Overall, the phone is very nice and it runs smoothly as it has 2gb of ram.
0|2|So many problems In this phone like phone is hanging, heating issue,buttons are not working
1|4|This is all of it.The beast you can get in a good range of money. Perfomance is excellent,the phone does not have the word lag.Runs very smoothly. Camera is also far better in this range segment. Heating is minor there in the phone, people saying heating is there which is to much do not beleive them. Sound is execllent after update of miui 7. Get the phone without thinking anything. And i haven't seen heating issue which is too much.
0|1|everytime I tried booking this phone during offer through mobile app, after entering all the details of payment and , it says try again later. have tried more than thrice. very disappointing.
1|5|pros: camera both price light weight brilliant display miui7 which has finally arrived 441 ppi snapdragon processor
0|5|worth buying for dis price.... cam is totally awesome....cant stop taking pics :D no heating issues yet.. updated to MIUI 6.7.2.0 (cool interface if u fed up with usual look) slim and stylish handset "girls!! just dont think and but it :P"
0|1|Just recevied the phone yestarday , kept it on charge before switching on , tryed switching on the device after full 100 % charge , browed through the mobile for 10 min , switched it off again , post 3 hours felt heavy heating sensation in the mob (heater effect) , tryed to switch it on " showed battery as 2% ) .. horrible experience - returning back asking for replacement :( will review again post replacement
1|2|No doubt this is a very good device in camera, speed, connectivity, screen resolution. Specially in this rate. But apart from this, this phone exist with heating problem and the features are quite different/difficult from other android phone. While applying any wallpaper the font color dont get change as per the background. In my phone there was a problem with alarm clock as well, snooze after 3 minutes after setting the time of 10 minutes and get silent after ringing twice. So please think twice before buying this phone.
0|1|product looks very attractive. but has too many problem network connectivity, heating, radiation, battery and so on... i have bought the products for more than a lakh in FK. i use to praise FK like anything, but they were very bad in this. honor 4X is comparatively too good. they claim 45degree is within the limit. i could not hold the phone near to ear for more than 5 mins.
0|4|Hi Buddies ...! To Be an honest writer, i reviewed about the overall stuffs about " Mi 4i". Lets enjoy it. I've rated on the various aspects of the gadget 1) STYLE: Slim & Handy. Just like the IPhone 6. Since it is 5'' screen it is best to hold and to be fit our pocket. And i advice go for a coloured one, ratther than buying classic white. Because of its pure attire, dirt and stains are easily visible on the first day itself. 2) CAMERA: To be decent, the camera was better (not the best). Because i was an HTC lover, i used various HTC handsets (Desire X, One, M8), where there autofocus and richness was unmatchable with this. Rear camera is good, but it doesnt give any pucca focussing effect, even when tap. Front was pretty good ( as we cant afford more with 5MP). 3) PERFORMANCE: Performance for techies means Gaming....!! Its gives smooth play with most of the High End games like Asphalt 8-Airborne , Nova , GTA series...etc., Like our other reviewers, it gets hot while playing. Its not an big issue. NO ONE CAN MENTION A SMARTPHONE NAME WITHOUT HEATING, DURING HIGH PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES. 4) BATTERY: To be decent, Mi 4i has a poor battery backup. It can withstand 8-10 hours on the basic usage. One good thing is that , it has FAST CHARGING facility. Good for today's busy work. 5) '''''NO HEATING ISSUE''''' : I swear there is no heating issue on this phone. And MIUI provides an UI update of MIUI v 6.7.0. It was good to experience Mi without heating issue. If so ur heart feels, buy a cover. 6) SOUND QUALITY : Average sound quality. Doesn't provide a headset. Need to spend extra bucks for that bullshit. Has a equalizer and headphone options for user comfort. THE FINAL VERDICT It was awesome phone for the price, good deisgn, better picture, sleek design, average battery backup.
1|1|Mobile gets Heated Quickly Looses Screen Sensitivity Often Constantly Hangs and Needs Reboot There if Problem in Detecting WI-FI signal especially WSK password protected Camera Quality is Good
0|1|I got this mobile 2 days back. Now I am regretting why i bought this product. The heat it generates during/after voice call and video call (Just 5 mins) is like you are holding the hot iron rod.
0|2|Mobile getting hang with just clicking for picture more than 4-5 pic, you need to lock and unlock it again and again. also every morning you need to off - on the mobile. need to clean other apps recently you were working with again and again.
0|4|I ordered this phone 3 months ago Firstly i am very happy to see this phone initial impression was very good. Then a few months it lag a lot and then after so many updates it work ood. Then i uprade miui6 to miui7beta . My phone performance goes ahead.Ram management also good,but it lag in music and others apps. Mi is giving MIUI7 gobal version on 27 october 2015.......
0|5|I purchased this in BBD (BIG BILLION DAY) SALe by FLIPKART.. I am amazed to see the discount.. I am impressed by the quality and usage of the phne that this is my second purchase from the website.. Great processor and touch is quite fast with one of the best front camera .. SELFIE ppl dont miss it ! 10/10 for this phone
0|4|Awesome phone Full HD graphics When I bought the phone, on Day 1 , it started heating, but when I updated it, Heating gone away, Now it sometimes heats when playing high graphics game Asphalt 8 airborne, THe phone comes with 2 gigs of ram but onlly 1 gb is available to the user, still the phone does not lag. Awesome phone at the end of the day, Using the phone from last two months and it has been updated 5 times, amazing architecture, 64 bit, full HD display.
1|2|I bought this Phone on 30 July 2015. After 2 Months only My Speaker Stopped working. I visited Xiaomi India Service Center at Vikas Marg to repair the same. Sorry to say that just to repair / replace a speaker which is in guarantee period they have asked me to come after 20 Day's to collect my Phone.. I dont know how i am going to manage my day to day work without a phone. A request, please think twice before you go for Xiaomi Phones. Regards, Louis M Dsouza
0|4|Its an amazing phone But friends if you want to buy this mi 4i please buy it in a colour except white colour Because when scratches comes to this phone it looks very bad. surely buy it in yellow , black , purple colour
1|1|working not good, automatically on & off hanging compare with local brand and Mi4i better local brand,
0|1|Product has defect so many times ask to replace but was not done. still i have issue with this phone.
1|1|seems like cheaper phones are not worth buying. If you want use whatsapp non stop then dont buy this phone. If i open any applications with in 5 Min it heated to much and Internet related issue. I have used it only for 2-3 hrs and its temp bump to 42 degree.... Over heating device after 4 minutes continue talk, also not support video of resolution 322*240.
1|1|I used the product for a month pro 1.camera is good 2.slim 3.dual 4g cons 1.a lot software bugs 2.u will get 400mb free RAM in daily use 3.gets hang 4.pocket dail function has big issue Not worth to buy Go for Some Other
1|1|In reality Horrible and Cheap.No local Support from OEM. every two days the phone hangs. most of the corporate applications are not supported.Thanks to the customised OS. Use the phone for calling for 15 minutes: it heats up to an extent that the skin becomes red.
1|1|Please don't buy any Xiaomi phone in India, or get reqdy to buy a new one as soon as your phone starts creating problem. Going to an authorised service station is a waste of time and energy. Pathetic experience, if they find any manufacturing defect in the phone they will say that liquid has been found inside. This is what i realised when i went to deposit my phone to the service centre. 2 guys were already complaining about this and i was the third one. The spares cost of the phones is too high that any body will prefer buying a new one, Nice strategy by the company.
1|1|First of all, don't just choose a phone by going through the specs they offer. This phone has a Snapdragon 615 chipset, yes the one which has heating issues in many phones, and guess what, this phone has beaten all of them in the heating competition, Boom! The temperature may go upto 55 degree Centigrades while playing some games, which is uncomfortably hot to handle. Moreover even after browsing for about 15 mins, the phone starts heating. While playing games, the phone even lags sometimes, which was not expected from a phone with such specs. It has 2 gb ram, out of which you get less than 500 mb to use. The rest is all eaten by the heavy MIUI. The only things that I like about this phone are the camera and it's full HD display. Pros: 1. Full HD screen 2. Camera (Both 13 MP and 5 MP) 3. Light weight/ Slim/ Good looks Cons: 1. UI lags many times 2. Heating issues 3. Some applications crash sometimes 4. Low volume Instead, I would suggest you all to go with Moto G 3rd Gen. Although you get to see some low specs on paper, but believe me, Motorola is a great brand and it has optimized everything to make such a device which performs way better than this chinese product. It's lag free and has no heating issue at all. And at the same price tag, you even get expandable memory and water proof features which are something to be considered.
0|1|I brought mi4i mobile from flipkart. After 35 days mobile front camera got repaired. Mobile heating like iron box, if not using internet and games also. Then i given mobile to service center at chennai. Then they took long time to repair and service center response is very bad and they not even pick up the phone to confirm the repair. After getting repair of front camera, within two days rear cemera got repair. As of now, i have used many smart phones, but this is worst mobile in my life. My best advice is don't go for any xiaomi products.
0|1|I have been using MI4i for the past two months ever since i have been facing frequent call drop. Almost each and every call drops frequently. Its really irritating. THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE PHONE IS FAULTY. I tried changing the sim cards, changed the network mode (2g, 3g LTE), updated the latest MIUI to (6.7.1.0), If there is a hardware problem kindly recall the phone.
0|5|So Nice and phone functionality & feature are so good and faster. i am happy with this phone ! Thanks MI
1|2|Everything is Good.But More Heating Problem. Micro Sd is not supported.Camera is very good both front and back camera. Pendrive is also supported.
0|3|Writing this review after 3 Months usage. The first thing to say is the hopeless aftersales service of MI. My Charger became faulty within one month. After 45 days my front camera started giving problems. The camera gives grainy pictures. Tried calling their support. They told some cache wiping . But nothing worked out. They told to take to service center. I am living in Calicut Keral. My nearest Service Center is Ernakulam abt 200 KMS away. Also there are 3 Service centers in Kerala. But none of them are reachable. So unless you have a MI service center near you never ever buy this product. When I searched MI forums a lot of other customers are facing front camera issues. But MI has never taken any steps to resolve it. Speaking abt the product PROS 1. Display is good. 2. Battery is good. 3. Decent Cameras 4. Interface is fine 5. I am not heavy gamer.. So cant comment abt heating CONS 1. Low Speaker / Ring volume 2. No headphones, Case, along with the phone 3. Speaker placed in back side doesn't give good volume 4. Hopeless support
0|4|For normal use it's good..! Heating prob occurs at times..! Quality and config is superb.! Overall performance is superb.
0|4|Purchased a terribly elegant white Xiaomi mi4i with a COD last week from flipkart and must say it was a fantastic experience. The smart phone looks smart and acts smart as well in the sense it is absolutely worth the money spent. I think. Earlier i had faced a problem with EKART but the service of delhivery was must better. Tripti Pune
0|5|Pros 1.No heat issue at all. I have downloaded much heavier games and played them along many applications running simultaneously. No lag whatsoever. 2. Camera quality is brilliant(both front and rear). As compare to Moto G(3rd gen) it is superior. 3. Battery backup it moderate. 4. Display is absolutely magnificent. Full HD makes a perfect display. 5. Lightweight. Again thumbs up!!! Cons 1. MIUI eats up too much RAM. Even after having 2GB of RAM it always occupies more than 50%. But there is no lag in application loading or switching between them.
0|5|Awesome Mobile ,Good build Quality,good sound Quality good, only small heating problem Provide a relevant, unbiased overview of the product. Readers are interested in the pros and cons of the product.
0|5|Awesome mobile, as well as quick service of Flipkart..EMI option are very easy & transplant.its very helpful for who's person not buy to expensive gadget on cash payment. Thank you Flipkart
0|5|but phone is heating while playing games and using wifi but good phone and just analysis all the mobile and then come to this mobile camera clarity is good sound decent, display superb, lot of facilitys then only this phone is heating
0|5|I think this is the best camera available in a phone AFAIK. The selfies and pics are simply superb and the speed of the phone is simply superb! Buy it before it sells out.
0|3|Bought this phone for my wife during the Flipkart Season Sale under Exchange and Cashback offers. Xiaomi Mi 4i is a phone very high on Specs and Features. Ideal buy at the price point it is available. Major Drawback is no support for additional SD Card. The memory available is only around 12 GB. Also you can feel the lag even if it has the latest MIUI6 based on Lollipop 5.0.2 after continuous use of around a month. This phone is Ideal for people who do not have too heavy usage of the phones and hence do not load too many apps on the phone.
0|5|Best device in this price range.(No looking Back) pros: light weight Stylish beyond expectations BATTERY: Minimal heat generated (Used continuosly for 4 hrs , intensive Gaming) after the latest update by MIUI 6.6.6.0 Camera : Good Cons: Has no inbuilt MENU
1|1|After a month of my purchase of Mi4i,the phone in not charging.I have submitted the mobile in Mi service centre they said the mobile charging panel is issue,so they attached a new one.Now after changing the charging panel the same issue ocurs.They said the charger have the problem so they replaced it with new charger.And again the same issue ocurs as i am was checking the mobile in a service centre after delivery.They said now they have to change the Battery and Motherboard.I have been visiting the Mi service centre by travelling 2 hours from my home.I have visited the the service centre 4 times but the issue is not resolved.It has become an HEADACHE
0|1|Even after getting the replacement, the phone has not stopped giving issues like, charging is not happening if the battery level goes below 10% you have to switch it off and charge. sometimes the voice of the other person is not audible. touch doesn't respond at times, apps crash frequently. A definite no buy.
1|4|First Day of Usage : 20-08-2015 I had used nexus 4 for last 3 years. I wanted to buy the new nexus but they are bit bulky. So I chose Mi4i as I liked its design, it fits my current budget and wanted to get hang of so hyped MiUi 6 . Below are few pointers which I found out. The comparison is done with nexus 4 only as I have only used that before. All are my personal opinions with no intention to hard anybody. 1. Looks and Design (Score 4)- Mi4i scores equal to nexus 4 on this aspect as Nexus 4 was also very beautiful. I will rate it 4 when compared to other devices in range of 12-22. Only exception for me in looks is Asus Zenfone. That scores high 5 in this segment . 2. Camera - (Score 5) - For me its very very good in comparison with Nexus 4. They do have very good camera UI. 3. Battery Life (Score 4) I know many people are having issues with battery life. I hope I dont get that in future but based on my usage on first day. I am very satisfied with the battery life. I am moderate user, no gaming but youtube videos, continuous Emails, Whatsapp, FB, zomato and lots of apps. 4. MiUI (Score 3) - This was one of the factors that I wanted to experience when I booked this device. Not so good as hyped. I more sort of like stock android over it. 5. Performance (Score 2 ) - Nexus and all other google play devices beat this performance hands down. There is bit of lag while shifting in between apps. Screenshot takes time. Camera app is bit slow. In all the 2 GB RAM is not worth it or its getting utilized in MiUi stuff itself . You wont get much RAM for own utilization,if you are serious gaming freak I would request you not to buy this device. 6. Connectivity (Score 3 ) - This lags in getting 3G signal many times. On 2G it works fine but 2G is bygone now and considering this supports LTE , I dont think this device is ready to handle 4G. However not so bad experience so I will rate 3 on this parameter. 7. Audio and Video Quality (Score 5) - Very decent output in comparison with Nexus 4. Both Audio and Video are awesome with feature of choosing headphone mode. Which I liked a lot. 8. Overall ( Score 4) - If you are moderate user and you like sleek phones with good bright UI on top of it , please take this. If you are geeky or gaming freak, stay away from this. This will make you cry . I hope this device stays good for longer. But after buying this I felt that I am taking risk. Lets see if works out. I will add to this review as I use it going forward.
0|3|Phone is good but the sound is extremely slow, not able to listen music with little noise . Other than the mentioned problem , I found it a good phone. Thanks
0|1|It's really a bad product from day 1 i am facing battery problem and how to replace it still i don't know why such products you are market ing i don't know really it's creating problem for me my friends told me not to purchase china item but i didn't listen now i am facing huge problem rating i will give 0 but option is not there
0|4|Mobile is too handy nd every thing runs smoothly touch nd Camera amazing but sometime some app will get close automatically dont knw y
0|1|I don't think this phone is in anyway better than likes of moto G 3rd gen etc. The problems that I faced: 1. As everyone have mentioned, it gets heated up a lot 2. I faced problem with 4G connectivity. I had to go to the service center and then only it got fixed. 3. The phone hangs even when just 2-3 apps are running, leave aside HD games n all 4. Whenever I try to connect to a new wifi network, the phone hangs everytime I try to enter a password. U have to reboot it a number of times before it doesnt hang. I had taken a MI power bank earlier and it stopped working, Still I showed trust in MI 4I, utterly disappointed. I am done with MI products for ever.
0|2|I'll be direct... performance is poor. Many Apps are lagging including "play store" and "facebook". Pros: Good display, Good battery, light weight, slim and good design Cons: Lags for most of the app, Heating up sometimes, Camera ok, Bad sensor response time, or you can say slow sensors, No headset. GPS is not accurate. Not for gamers.
0|1|I am big fan of Xiaomi and used Mi3 in past. My screen broke off so decided to upgrade to Mi4i. The day i received delivery applied all upgrades/patches. My usage is mostly limited to Google Maps, Calls and Whatsapp. Zero Gaming... After 4-5 days of usage i found phone started heating up when Google maps was running to the extent that i cannot talk. I thought it was just one time ...Then it happened again randomly.. BTW by now i had already invested 2000 in genuine Mi accessories... It started happening almost everyday on random mostly when i am travelling in car with AC ON. Lodged a complaint with Flipkart and then i started seeing the real colors of Indian e-commerce Flamboyant real colors. They refuse to accept the fact that it is heating and sent me one App..They called me and check temperature with App which was much less obviously as the phone was not heated up..They refuse to accept the return.. I am also extremely regular shopper with Flipkart however i never had to return anything , this is first time i had something to return and i was shocked they way they refused.. In fact recently i bought a laptop from paytm which was slow and hanging and they refunded my money without any questions asked. Needless to say i bought the next laptop again from PayTM itself.. Actually you get to know the real principles of any company when something goes wrong and Indian Poster boy has let me down here big time.. Never thought that Mister Bansal will try to cheat people on name of 30 days warranty.. I more disappointed with Flipkart than the Phone...I only wanted replacement with the piece with no defect.. Needless to say I will be bidding adieu to Flipkart..... You might want to wait this to happen with you and then bid adieu or can take this step proactively...
0|2|.. not so much exiting.. always hanging.. heating after upgrade as well.. touch not working . intermittently speakers not working. some times mic not working. Slim and sleek is the only pro.
0|5|I have been using this phone from 5th May 2015 i.e Approx 3 months.Initially when i purchased this phone it had heating problem, phone used to heat up quickly but after 1 week or so after purchasing phone the update of 900MB came i updated my phone and Trust me it resolved all the heating problems now i have installed games of 1 gb and 1.5 gb still phone works very properly. So If planning to buy this phone? It is really worth.It has a good display nice build nice camera and MIUI is also nice and There is no lag while playing games and the nice thing is that it charges very quickly. Overall I am happy with this phone at this price tag!! AND IF YOU ARE FACING HEATING PROBLEM IN YOUR PHONE JUST UPDATE YOUR PHONE IT WILL SURELY RESOLVE YOUR PROBLEM!! :)
1|5|using since 2 months.. now in MIUI 6.6.6.0, battery backup is good, i should say a day time heavy usage at full charge at morning leaves me at almost 30% at evening when i get back at home. My Usage:- Calls - 2g/3g(auto) - almost 20 calls totalling to maybe 1.5Hrs - Internet calls - 2 Hrs min Data - Wifi and Mobile Data is On 24/7. it switches and connects automatically when i reach home. Games - not playing games heavily in mobile. max 10 - 15 minutes. Display - at auto brightness ( with double tap to wake ON). I will recommend and has already made two of my friends get Mi4i at 10% off offer just like me. I am looking forward to life expire my mi4i for my next adventure with the latest mi phone of that time.. maybe mi7.. :) :) :)
0|4|I am using mi4i since 24th May. I have one more in 14th July. I have already use many android phone, such as Samsung Galaxy Note 3, HTC 816g, Xperia C3, etc... but believe me or not, this is a great mobile than all the mobile which i have used earlier. I am not explaining the specification which already explained many. But I would like to share some good and bads about this phone. Good:- 1. Design... It is unibody design that lends it a very solid look and feel.It's build from high quality polycarbonate which gives very premium looks like iphone 5s. 2. Display... this is something great which is not available in most high end phone. 3. Camera... Fabulous. I checked with Xperia Z3 & Galaxy A7 at Chroma Showroom, I can say the xiaomi mi4i camera is something great. 4. Perfomance...as a normal user I am very satisfied the way it is performing. 5. Battery... for me it is lasting 36 to 40 hours with normal use. Bad:- 1. No Headset... Xiaomi should have prove this. All the ear phone will not work with mi4i. 2. Heating... It is major problem in all xiaomi phones and the story is still continuing. Even i have done the new OTA update, still the heat is there. 3. Limited Storage... out of 16gb internal storage, 10.68gb of which is available for applications and user date when you boot up the phone for the first time.. which is good enough for me..but not everyone. Xiaomi is offering USB OTG support for this phone. Overall it is nice deal and you can easily beat the high end phones around 20,000/- price tags.
1|2|Though the phone has good features, my phone had a heating and subsequent power off issue which reflects on the overall quality of the phone. 4 times into the service centre and no resolution yet. understand that my phone has serious hardware and battery issues. Not a recommended phone for new buyers. There are better options.
0|1|I got this phone nearly 2 months back. There are a lot of issues with this phone, but I am listing down the major ones here. First, as every one as written in their reviews, there is a lot heating problem with this phone. When you are charging this phone its practically impossible to talk. But it doen't end here the phone unnecessarily get heated up even when its not charging Second, as every one has written the loudspeaker is really frustrating. Some time the phone goes mute and some times the sound produced by loudspeaker has a lot of noise with it. Although this behavior is intermittent, but it is very frustrating. I have got these issues in less than 2 month of usage, I dont know how many such defects are yet to come. So my suggestion is please don't go with this phone.
0|5|i bought this phone two months ago and enjoyed replacing my samsung Duos . Picture quality is good with many options of effects. Battery is good for general use, though i do not use for gaming. perfectly happy with the product :)
1|2|This phone has lot of expectation before launching when i purchase this phone i was not happy as heating problem & rates are worth
1|4|This review questions the aggressiveness shown by Xiaomi and Flipkart to sell Mi4i without Beta testing the phone. Initially I was sceptical about buying this phone after reading the reviews but could not find any other phone with similar specs and price, so finally purchased Grey on June 24. The phone had all issues mentioned in the reviews like heating, battery draining even without any use. I used to dread taking this phone outstation as battery will die out anytime if not charged twice in a day. The rear camera also freezed once while attending an important function, missed all those beautiful moments. Finally I requested return which obviously Flipkart refused on flimsy grounds. But thankfully to my utter surprise after July 24 update the phone became a GEM. No or little heating, The battery has also lasted for 36 hrs. without recharge and still going. So the question arises that if hardware issues could have been resolved by ROM update then why were Xiaomi and Flipkart were in such a big hurry to sell this phone without going for vigorous testing......... Hope the phone behaves as above in future...........
0|4|Current MIUI Version: MIUI 6.6.10| Stable I'm writing this review to share my experience on Xiaomi Mi4i after 2 Months of Usage. I'm a medium user with no serious gaming. I multitask a lot and here's is my genuine review: Pros: [+] Very Light weight and slim with premium looks. It feels great in holding in hand. The build quality is also great. [+] You can easily use with one hand. [+] 1080p FHD Display is one of the best displays employed in the 10k-20k range smartphones. The colour reproduction is excellent. [+] Excellent 5 MP Front Camera 13 MP Rear Camera. The photos are sharp and vivid enough. [+] After the 6.6.6 Update, we get 1 GB RAM free out of 2 GB RAM. No issues or lags with multitasking. [+] The Quickcharge v2.0 feature is very handy and helps us to charge the 3030 mAh battery fast. [+] With the latest updates, the battery stands for 2 Days with casual usage. At heavy usage, it lasts a whole day. So the battery seems great for a normal usage. [+] MIUI v6 is wonderful to use and has lots of features. Also the OTG, Sunlight Display and Other Sensors works well. [+] The Smart Flip Cover makes it grip to hold and also adds protection to device without adding bulkiness. The Sleep Wake sensor also works fine. Cons: [-] As you heard in all reviews, YES, the phone does heats under gaming. But under normal usage, it DOES not heat. The heating issue may be due to Snapdragon 615 chipset. But after the cover was put on, i barely noticed heating. So dont get down with the "heating" if you are not a gamer. [-] Expandable storage may be an issue for some users, but i'm happy with the 16 gigs. Also the OTG helps us if we want to store any large files. *Please understand that Xiaomi is working hard in giving updates for this phone and rectifying bugs. This is evident from the fact that after my purchase i got frequent updates: 6.5.6 -> 6.6.1 -> 6.6.2 -> 6.6.6->6.6.10(Latest). So dont worry, i think the phone will be updated with a stable rom soon. *The MIUI forum is very helpful for understanding the new developments and also to clear our doubts regarding the phone. ADVICE: Please do a FACTORY RESET after an update. This will fix all the issues. Also Try to use original Mi accessories to retain its looks. FINAL VERDICT: The Mi4i definitey is a strong competer in the sub 15K segment with lot of stellar features including Display, Camera etc but having issues of heating under gaming. So for a casual to medium user who wants an overall best user experience, Mi4i is a great device to look for. For gamers, stay away from this Device. RATING: 4/5
0|5|Thought of giving a review for Xiaomi Mi 4i I have been using this beauty since a week. Pros: 1. The Build Quality is awesome 2. The Launcher is clean and neat. 3. Display is awesome with a 441 PPI Display. 4. The Best cam in the market with 2K resolution. 5. Fell in love with the front cam.. 6. Sound quality is clear and so good. 7. Battery easily lasts for a day which includes an hour of gaming, wifi, 3g etc. 8. Unique design ( No trace of Android Lolipop ) 9. No heating issue after the update 10. Slim body and light weight. 11. Permissions is awesome Cons: 1. Inexpandable memory 2. Lags a bit while multitasking (only 800-900 mb ram is remaining) 3. Can also be 1GB RAM unused if you do not use any background running application. Thank you. If you find this review useful Give it a thumbsup so that for other users it may be useful
0|5|pros: 1. great display 2. good music player subject to good headphones(speaker sound is low) 3. value for money cons: 1. performance not top notch(being a octa core). there are moments when phone will take a second more to open a app conclusion: go for it PS: the phone doesnt heat up much(justifiable) after the latest update.
0|3|Even when mobile data & all other features are turned off power is still draining. It takes around 4- 4.30 hrs to get fully charged..... so beware..........
0|3|All features are good. -battery life is awesome. -user interface is good. * after using 2-3 apps at same time phone HEATS very fast. *during charging also it gets heated.
0|1|i bought this phone yesterday for my friend , it has started heating like anything .. cant even place calls or do hold the phone for a long time pathetic service and hardware is too bad if this heats up a lot !!!! even after update the phone doesnt stop itself from heating up , although i have applied for a return !! i dont know about other reviews people are making .. but in my case it heats up like i will not recommend it to any one !!
0|4|the phone seems to heat up... no expandable memory...except that a very nice device ......................................................................................................................
0|3|the phone have serious heating problem, the phone get heated while playing games and using internet buy only if u can tolerate heating upto 50 c becuase they will not replace ur device until it reaches temp of 50c. i have expericiened temp upto 46 c. if u want better phone go for lumia 730 its good
1|1|I bought the Mi4i 16 gb grey mobile from flipkart, trust me its useless. dont but this mobile phone. After paying 13,000 there are not 1 or 2 issues with the mobile but plenty. Following are the problems - 1.After inserting micro sim, it still show - NO SIMCARD 2. It take more than 15 - 20 mins for mobile phone to get switched on / off. 3. Music cant be played - It shows - Can't be played 4. The phone is hanging a lot. Flipkart technical team will call only once in a day as its a system generated schedule. they will again call me tomo , which i have to wait!! BLUNTLY NO TO MI4I MOBILE PHONE !!!! Flipkart asking for user rating - it must be negative, but they dont have.
1|2|Please don't buy this Phone, Over Heating Issues , which will heat up after basic use like Open Cam On Flush light Music Player it's an heater box please don't buy this is my request
0|5|I am using this phone from last 7 days there is no issues, Very good Battery back up, no heating issue & good Camera overall its a beautiful phone
1|1|I would advise you to stay as far away as possible from this crappy phone. I had purchased it as a gift for someone and when I was able to give it to the person ( had been sitting sealed for 1 month hence return option expired). The screen had a black Patch. I visited a Service Center in Defense colony, Delhi only to be told that they only provide software support and no hardware support. How outrageous is that? completely shitty after sales network, so if you trust your stars that you wont get a buggy one, go for it, but if you want a safer investment, do not buy this.
0|3|Review after 1 month use: Pros: Excellent camera Very good display quality Ease to use Very good design Good performance Good battery backup- even after gaming and internet usage for the day Cons: Heating issue but not a big problm!!! Phone getting hang sometimes especially video player !! Charging problem found which got corrected after update.
0|1|Worst Battery ever even in standby mode the battery drains within 8hrs. Second Sim card is getting undetected automatically, frequent unexpected restarts, Even I complained 2 times in Flipkart within 1 week of the purchase but there executives were not responding properly and now they're saying that 30 days are over so they can't do anything.
1|2|very good look and good feel while handling the phone,430 ppi display is very good,rear camera is very clear but the problem with the phone the Mi interface not user friendly, worst part of the phone is very bad service support and customer support and net work connectivity. Within weeks time I have replaced the mi4i rfor bad network connectivity, and second one is also having the same problem,even connected to airtel 4g and bsnl broad band the signal strength will be in 0.1-1Kbs. No response from Xiomi/mi customer centre. I had tough time with Flipcart customer care to get the replacement and found same problem with the second phone also.No answer from mi customer care centre, I don't know how to solve this . I suggest please think twice/thrice before buying this phone.
0|4|I had bought Mi 4i during flash sale in May and am writing this review after 2 months of usage. * no heating issues...i had updated the firmware soon after buying and probably that helps * battery is quite good...though it doesn't last 2 full days even on battery saving 2G signal...if u put on 3G then its just more than 1 day...if u select 4G then just 1 day!! * screen resolution is awesome...adjusts screen brightness automatically in sunlight or low light * very light weight and finishing is sleek * 2 GB RAM....sadly the available is around 1 GB only for installing apps as rest all used by Android or default apps * both front and rear cameras are great...very minimal shutter lag compared to any other phone in this price range..nice flash also....however, it lacks various shooting modes which are common in an average phone also nowadays...so thats a dampener * Performance is great...multi-tasking is smooth due to the octa-core processor * MI UI is good but didnt feel great...overall I did not find Lollipop as an improvement over kit kat * no earphone provided...thats a downer for such a high-end phone...the sound is low for media, ringtone or speaker but good enough for regular phone usage To summarize, you simply cannot get a high-end and fully loaded smartphone with these features at this price...and so just go for it...unless you want everything perfect in which case you need to spend 35k for experia Z3 which is the next best thing!!
0|1|Camera and display is good. processing is slow, , not user friendly quality.things are not good.i not expect this feature/quality.
1|1|dont buy any mi product. they are made up of cheap quality materials. i have purchased this cell 2 months ago. last week cell is not getting charged i went to service center they have cahrging card. agian after 5 days of use i have got the same problem. and now i am going to service center. if you want to go to center like me please go ahead buy these dam waste mi products.
0|5|Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing (here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing, its quite common , i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating, gets warm during browsing) i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly.
0|4|now its been 2 months i am using this phone ,, fully satisfied with its features and performance ,:- 1- best camera (both front and rear) 2-games runs butter smooth 3-awsm disply 441pixel amazing. 4-classic look i wll deduct 1 star for its non expandable memory.
0|4|buid quality is great.... body has metal finish look even though its polycarbonate... camera quality is excelent... heats up a bit.... ( not too much) excellent display OVERALL AWSOME PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE... completely satisfied
0|5|after a long comparison i opted to go for this. the camera qualities are very good, especially the front camera (5 mp)....very sensitive touch screen, good sound and has an exceptionally good display....but did not observe the overheating problem during multitasking even after running the apps for a very long time...u can play subway surfer, clash of clans, Asphalt 8 also .... after playing the subway surfer for 30 mins while charging the temperature was 38 C, which was OK.....update the system and experienced the awesome Mi 4i
0|5|the phone is best in this price range and the most imp i am really happy with flipkart replacement policy ............ thnx for the replacement of my phone .... best customer support ....
0|4|You will get similar config's at better price, so this should be a phone around 10k. Quality & build is quite good. There was heating issues & random outgoing calls by itself (Seems like a software bug)... However, it was resolved after the update. Camera is pretty decent for the overall price of the phone.
1|2|Are you calling this as service. The BlueDart's Baramati branch is the worst branch, they never give door delivery. always calls the customer and said that come here and collect your product. But i'll give flipkarts 5/5 stars BlueDart you dosent deserve a single star
0|4|Awesome phone with this price range...battery backup is good and No heating bugs awsome picture quality
1|4|everything is good in this phone.. i hav to use this phone last 2 week and i have no any prlm with my mi4i... Good Camera , betry, screen , disign , performance everything perfect.....
0|1|Thought of giving MI4i a chance and purchased it. Within 2 days the volume key stopped working. Got phone replaced. The new phone Came but that too have a sim slot issue. One of the sim card slot in tray was not working. Got the phone replaced again. Now the new phone came , hoped it will work well. But after 3-4 days of use , problems have started appearing in it too. There are random black patches coming on screen. Noticed a prominent black line at one corner of screen. does flipkart replaces the devices with the refurbished or do mi4i does not ensure the quality and robustness of mobile phones. Just hoping to get my cash back and will definitely go for a branded phone this time such as samsung or other
1|1|Heating of phone during charging is a major problem which all buyer will face with Mi 4i. BUT my phone's screen busted while charging, thankfully no one was hurt The customer care says it is a physical damage which cannot be covered under warranty, even if it is due to manufacturing fault !!!!! Xiaomi is taking all the buyers for a ride by promising warranty which is never there or as per their wish.
0|4|i purchased this phone on july 3rd, i have been using this phone for since then.Couple of days before i noticed a green mark in my screen.now i have requested for a replacement and going to get my replacement in next day.Apart from that i found this phone really great.First of all display and camera they booth are really the greatest that you can get it in this price range.for this prize the display quality was out of the world.Both the front and back cameras excel in taking photos in low light &out door.Video quality was ok.i did not face a heating problem till now,yes iam a moderate user &the phone heats up when you use it for browsing internet for long time.But it was never like i can't handle the phone situation i just felt a warm feeling anything as a huge problem.the battery performance is also good it lasts a day easily(12hrs)may be 20 hrs....but for 3000+ mah battery i dont think it is enough(when you use it for constant gaming and browsing it will last only up to 5-8hrs). Miui 6 is great it gives the user chance to customise your device completely.if u need a stock android experiance you can easily use google now launcher.snapdragon 615 is a good option but the phone is sluggish sometimes.that will force you to restart your device at least once in couple of days so that the device starts working smoothly........if you are looking for a phone for day to day use you can complete for this device it is totally worth it
0|3|mi4i mobile is not that much to the expectations. Pros: light weight camera(fornt and back) Cons: Not good for mobile data which is the main feature for smart phone !!! :-( i got a defect product (unfortunately both sims are disabled automatically). Finally they replaced the product after a lot of calls!!!
0|2|The look and feel of the device is great, camera and picture quality is inferior to none. The sunlight visibility feature is excellent no problem in operating the device in bright sunlight. I found no lags in normal usage. However, in terms of performance specially i rate it as poor the device is heating like anything, battery drain is enormous not lasting even 6 hours even without any battery draining applications like games etc. Also the proximity sensor has some issue, i experience the call quality is below average, not sure whether it is due to operator or phone. Just on the second of my purchase I heard a very loud and cracking noise from the speakers during live call in speaker mode. Though i must admit, i did not get again I requested for return, i found unusual flip-flop approach from flipkart side. There service engineers are trying to get in touch with me since last three days. I have already stopped using this phone and switched back to my old phone as i fear batteries may not last during critical phone calls.
0|5|Don't think about negative review.....phone is awesome...and yes if you have any problem then flipkart is gave you best solution...best service of flipkart....i have lenovo k3 note and Mi4i But Mi4i Is Far Better Then Lenovo K3 Note...Perfect Phone Under 20k....Flipkart Is Awesome....Thank You Flipkart....!!!
0|4|Firstly, I would like to thank Flipkart for their quick delivery on the product. Guys, please note that this is my honest review of using this phone for around 2 months. Pros- Brilliant 1080p Screen with Vibrant Colors Good Camera. Honestly, I did not expect it to be good considering it was made in China! Lol Good Battery. A 3000 MaH battery in a 5 inch phone is nothing to complain about! Overall Build quality is good Performance is decent considering the price. 4G / LTE. Finally!1 Its always better to have a phone with LTE Bands. Now oming to the Cons/Negatives The UI is not stable. Crashes a lot of times even on simple things like while receiving a call Comes up with Error ' Unfortunately, Call function has stopped. Same applies to Gallery and Camera The Phone heats up quite easily even while doing simple tasks like using Camera. This Phone becomes a tAWA aka Like a Hot frying Pan while playing any Game. Trust me this is so annoying. Heats up while using 4g/LTE Too. Specially when you enable Data or Voice Calling. I am really unsure of any Security/ OS Updates on this phone as this is a Custom UI (MiUi) Loudspeaker quality is bad. But thanks to some tweaks and updates this is getting better. No expandable Storage. This is the Biggest Con of all. Overall Verdict. You cannot ask for anything more from this phone when your getting it for this cheap with decent features. Yes, I understand everyone needs quality stuff, Trust me I have used a HTC One (M7) and the Build was awesome but camera sucks!! Every Phone has its Pros and Cons. But I feel this one has a Balance between Price and Performance and features good enough for Daily use.
1|1|heating very much. don't buy this handset...................................................................
0|4|I have been using Mi 4i grey product from last 2 weeks. Pros: 1. Its very handy and look premium in the hand. 2. Super clarity, worth a buy and sunlight display works when exposed to sunlight. Many of my old devices had a problem in viewing during sunny day outside. 3. OTG supported. 4. Big plus is 4G, i could download 10mb in 4 secs. Super fast with Airtel 4G. Cons: 1. Average battery backup. It didn't looked to me as a 3100mh battery as it lasts only for one day. 2. Gets bit of heating during charging and while gaming or on heavy usage. It came around 42 degree. 3. Non expandable memory, user will have approx. 10GB od space. 4. Not satisfied with image quality. Still images looks good but when clicked against moving objects it takes pathetic pictures. 5. Do not use without hard cases, since it looked to me delicate. Overall it looked to me good, in spite of many negatives. You can definitely worth a try. Not happy with Flipkart delivering the product. It took me almost a week to get this delivered.
0|4|After 2 months of usage I personally feel that mobile is great in terms of features in this price range. But lacks in battery & software(Heating & charging issues occur often) Pros: 1) Display 441 PPI is just awesome. Playing games and watching movies is superb. 2) Both primary & secondary Camera are fantastic. Focus & others features are quite decent. 3) Design of the mobile is good. Less weight. It's easy to remove stains on mobile. 4) Root access is great. Can remove unwanted default installed softwares. Cons: 1) Doesn't have expandable storage 2) Often I face heating issues 3) Battery 3120 mAh is for name sake. Battery drains too faster. 4) Software (MiUi) feels good but doesn't works properly at times. E.g: While charging the mobile at particular stage the charging stops. Say, charges from 10% to 64% thereafter I couldn't find any indication of charging. I need to restart the mobile to continue the charging process. 5) Sound quality is very worst and most of the headphones are not supported by Mi mobiles
0|1|I bought 2 of these phone during sale. I thought nothing can beat this configuration and all app will work great, But reality is far from it. The customized OS sucks. The battery discharges within 6-7 hours even on very low usage. Many regular apps hangs. Even the dialer hangs a lot. Most of the time only 250 MB of 2GB is left, even though I don't use many games or power apps much. The worst thing is happening now. The phone is not even charging and this is just within 10-15 days of usage (I did not use it for long after the purchase, I was supposed to give it as a gift to family). I have checked there is nothing wrong with the charger. Something is wrong with phone itself Now I have to contact Xiomi service center. I don't know how much they will help. My advice would be don't go for this phone it only promises to be good but it is simply waste of money.
0|1|hanging frequently and some times heated while charging the phone. when i am using internet n call came then at that time it also hang
1|5|Veryyyy VerYYYY nicEEE phonEEE... pros- 1>Display quality is superBBB 2>front camera is also superBB 3> back camera is good 4>Light weighted 5>good looking 6>build quality 7>slim size 8>comfortable in hand cons- >>yaa there is heating issue But that is not a deal breaker for me
1|5|1. Its been a week now and the phone is smooth like butter. 2. I am a MI fan and this phone has fulfilled my expectations. 3. It is worth the money. 4. No heating issues.(I found none, anyways laptops also heat). 5. Fully charge lasts for one whole day with regular use.
0|5|1. Awesome look and feel 2. Camera is also powerful 3. I am happy to have this product. Its so thin that gives it sexy look and front camera is awesome. Processor is also feels good when i used to play games. Only one drawback is You need to buy earphones externally,because no headset along with this.
1|5|Beautiful hardware ,nice software(need to learn), great specs and such low price No heating issue(updated the software),
0|5|First of all i would like to say that this is an amazing phone. Great features, great battery and the performance is great too at this price range. I was shit scared when i read the negative comments before buying the phone. Everybody stated that phone heats up like an oven but actually it's not. It's just regular heating for smartphones and even if you find it unusual, it is bearable and i don't mind the heat. Ofcourse if you play graphic extensive games like asphalt 8 it surely will heat up like anything. If you are a hardcore gamer then definitely not this phone. Mild to medium gamers can do with this phone. Day to day activities are easily done on this phone. The front and rear cameras are both great. The strength of the phone is quite good. It has Corning OGS glass which is at par with gorilla glass 3.(Same Company) I bought the white version of the phone which has matte finish. It feels good but a slippery too. The phone is light and quite slim. I'd say Xiaomi has done a great job making this phone and most probably they will keep releasing updates. There was already an update waiting for me as soon as i unboxed the phone and switched it on. I'd recommend this phone to everyone. :) P.S - I haven't found any faults with this phone. Been 1 week with this phone and already dropped it thrice. It looks still new. Goodluck guys. May you choose wisely. :D
0|4|Hardware is good, dropped couple of times, no dent.. device is sturdy. 1 day battery with full charge (WiFi ON full time, Mobile Data (2G) switched ON) Mobile Switching button and volume buttons are not that soft, design would be improved. Photos taken are of good quality, display quality is OK Recommend it for features given at this price!!
0|5|mi 4i is a great device at this price. mobile is good looking , slim . camera quality is preety good. you will get only 12 gb for storage . no lagging and no heating . battery life is well. go for it !!!!!!
0|4|its an awesome phone to have at this price . about the heating issue : i dint experience it till now. problems : no headphones included.
0|5|pros: 1) Camera - its just wow.!! 2) Battery Life - use the processor to its fullest, it doesn't give a :p :p :p 3) Build - 5/5 4) Display - Best ever lot more to say.!! cons: 1) the MIUI lags a little(rarely)... out of 2 GB RAM, the skin and the system takes 1 GB,but that doesn't make u depressed. 2) Rear Camera lens pop out a bit...u must have a back case for scratchless use..!! 3) Voice from the speakers feels a bit low. PS: Everybody stated about the HEAT issue...i think thats not a big issue ...u can't even notice it if u haven't read the reviews. Worth more than the price..!! Anyways, a smartphone is just used for a maximum of 365 days and the "4i" doesn't make u disappointed..!
0|5|i have bought mi 4i 3 weeks before ...one of the best phone i have ever used........awesome camera,stunning display,good performance..............it is totally a value for money product.
0|5|cmaera performance is wowwwww love this beauty and hate zenfone2 now and good luck no heating problem it is in zenfone so go ahead and buy mi4i
0|5|Hi All, Before buying this phone I have compared the performance of all the phones with the features like Camera, processer speed, Android version, Cost and Look & Feel. Camera - FULL HD - For every picture you will say WOW..! Even in Dark the picture perfect bright. Videos are HD. Processer - Latest processer which is not available in even most costliest branded phones. Octa Core - Excellent performance. Android Version - Lollipop support the latest apps and no lag at all. Superb performance. You will enjoy handling the phone and browsing through it. Cost - 13K - includes all the features of costlier phones. Look & Feel - Sleek and Thin. Holds good and easy to use. Overall - Perfect phone for everyone. Even my children 3Y and 8Y are able to handle the phone and features very easily. Game performance is also Superb..! Worth Buying. Don't miss buying it. Seller - Superb no words to say. First phone which got delivered had some issue with front camera. Immediately they tested the phone and agreed for return and got the new phone in perfect condition. Awesome seller.
0|5|Hi guys. Purchased this phone on the 18th June. Decent delivery time. Got it delivered on a Sunday. Reading all the negative reviews, worried me a bit but once I opened the box and actually used it, all my worries just cooled off. I downloaded the update as mentioned in couple of reviews. So ' NEVER ACTUALLY FELT ' the so called heating issue. All I can see are only pros and no cons for this wonderful product. Found many similarities between the iOS and the MIUI. But who cares Im enjoying every bit of this phone. The touch is soft and wonderful. Both the cameras are great. Sound quality is crisp (Using a skullcandy earphone) no earphones with the phone is a bit disappointing. But that is manageable. I connect this phone with my Sony home theater system via Bluetooth and it gives great output. Even better than my previous Sony Xperia C. Very sleek design. Battery lasts for a day and couple of more hours with good amount of usage. Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity is upto the mark. MIUI so far so good no lag not a single issue with the phone till date. Each and every pre installed app is wonderful and very much useful. Go for it guys. It is surely delivering whatever is mentioned in the product promotion.
0|1|expected too much from this product of MI .but got nothing , poor interface -frequent malfunction ,it becomes sluggish after installing decent amount of apps.low sound output but one good feature -you can cook your food over it.!!
0|3|Purchased this near to a month ago, Well i have used a range of smartphones, as moto g2 brokedown expecting a high spec phone and with a awesome experience from mi3, purchased it last month. With a week of usage only i found that the phone was rapidly heating even when it doesnt have any other apps installed than the ones that came with phone. No background usage ones or extensively usage ones.Still it heats to above 40C just for a call of more than 15mins and u know its unbearable to hold on near ur ear. Coming to the performance the phone is awesome with its display, performance no hanging issue even on lollipop, n MIUI6 handles and maskes sure the phone runs buttery smooth. The battery also lasts well for a day with a usage like 3g for 6-8hrs and 3hrs music and 1hr of gaming and slight calls and it lasted with 2g on for 2 days. The worst part is the experience with the flipkart customer care, even upon request they say upto 50C heating , the phone is working in perfect good condition, bhai i have purchased phone for using it not for testing if it works fine. wen ppl cant bare a temp outside of 48C how can a phone wrking at 50C be normal. Hate the customer care executives response barely saying u can visit nearest customer centre. I tried for a replacement and they reject just without a call and barely rejecting refund. Will never again buy from flipkart. Other than the heating part the phone is awesome which led me to give a rating of 3. Please buy only if in ur usage u can bare a 50 degree C temp in ur hands.
1|1|Hi, I bought Mi4i through Flipkart two days before. The day I received I found that Proximity sensor is not working properly. When I dial a number and press call icon, My display goes blank. It wont come back. Am not able to Disconnect the call, nor operate anything on the display. I have complained regarding this to Flikart people. They debugged and said everything is fine and they did some factory reset as well. It is still giving the same issue. Flipkart is not even exchanging the product. They cancelled my return request as well. Dont know what has to be done.
1|1|Lots of issues... 1. Heats up within 5 mins of continuous use. 2. Applications close automatically (FB, Whatsapp, etc) 3. Internet gets disconnected by itself Looks like this phone has full control on itself and doesn't let User to use it Now, Flipkart return policy another disappointment, they ask us to use app for them to check the problem itself is that Internet doesn't connect properly (both Wifi and mobile internet). Guys, if you want an intelligent phone which runs on its own without user's will, this is the one to go for. Wish I could give less than 1 star for both Mi4i and Flipkart's service.
0|4|I bought grey color phone in flash sale.Wow what a design, I am not able to let my eyes away from this, Superb superb design.I don't know how xiaomi built this slim beauty in this cost.Display, you cannot find any mobile in this price range(not even 20k range) to compare with this.Coming to built quality,you can hit and kill anyone with this without getting damaged,that strong it is,credit goes to xiaomi.(very less weight) Coming to camera, i am satisfied with both the cameras for pics,but video should be some what better. Coming to performance, I am able to play alphat 8(high end game) with out any lag. Coming to heat, yes, i can fell some heat at upper part, but not that much. Coming to battery,it is good. Bad part is, it comes with only 16 gb(hardly 10 gb usable) internal memory and not possible to expand it and no head set . My suggestion is to take it and feel the beauty.(you will never get disappointed in design and quality)
0|1|never ever buy this crap from cheap Chinese company, it gets heated like heater, network doesnt catch even if you are standing below mobile tower. i would have rated it 0 if i could.
0|5|Best android phone under 15k. Better than moto g. I recommend this product. The main reasons why you should buy this is; Full HD screen Superb Camera Excellent battery life The only con I see is lack of expandable storage. If you are a casual user, go for it. You will never regret. Thanks for reading my review. All the best!
0|5|excellent phone. Go for it. Excellent video quality. Nice speed. no heating and hanging issues found. nice battery backup.
0|5|The UI is great. The only thing lacking in MIUI is an app drawer, but still this doesn't cause any problem, rather the UI looks great without the app drawer! The video & camera quality are excellent and are same as told. This non expendable can be a problem for storage lovers/users. And for the ones who are thinking of playing games can also play,it gives a great gaming performance. I read about about some heating issues earlier, but after using this phone in this summer heat(37-45 *C), I didn't face any heating problems. And I hope I do not face any of this in the future.The only problem I feel is its RAM memory, only approx. 1GB is available for use. But the good thing is that all the pre installed apps can be uninstalled. Overall its a great value for money & I would like to give it a rating of 4.8/5.0 .
0|3|I Have Been using this device over a week... Gets Hot sometimes but Camera and screen Clarity beats everything Awesome battery backup upto 2 days with mobile data enables.. Best Phone under 13k
0|5|I have been using this phone for almost a month and please find below review based on usage. Pros: 1. Awesome display 2. Its very light weight 3. Like the MIUI interface and whole lot of exciting features like One-handed mode, Switching ON torch during lock mode etc. 4. Like the Sunlight display feature. Cons: 1. Speaker volume is very less 2. There are still few bugs which I noticed like screen goes blank after rejecting call etc. but still those get solved after you lock and unlock the phone, so nothing much to worry about. Hope those would be fixed in next update. With respect to the Heating issue, I have updated to the latest MIUI 6.5.6.0 and found there is not much heating. It gets slightly warm during heavy usage but that is acceptable. Overall it’s a very good phone and I love it.
0|1|snapdragon 615 is the same not the 2nd gen.......... subway surfer will also lag....i already returned ma fone
0|3|Phone is good, problems are heating issue and speaker volume is very less. Missing lots of phone calls because of low ring volume also unable to listen the GPS navigation voice. Phone is getting heated up while browsing using 3G. MIUI is great and no other issues observed. Think before you buy make sure speaker volume is sufficient for you.
0|3|This is my first review for any phone. I have brought this phone one and half month ago now I want to share my opinion for this phone so that people can get help. I can give 3 star out of 5. We can’t say it is amazing phone. Its good a phone. Cons: the heating issue is still there. We didn't receive earphone with this phone. Ear phone choose feature available in this phone but sometime earphone not supporting after selection. Difficulty to select your ringtones. Sometimes game is getting slow because of low memory even though 2GB RAM available. Pros: Nice look. Sound quality is good. Front camera is awesome however back is not that much. Battery backup is fine one day deal not more than that after normal use. Never hang till now.
0|1|Its a very big lesson for me that not to believe on Chinese Gadgets, I purchased Xiaomi Mi 4i just after one month of its launch in India. But within a month the front camera of the phone started giving problem and was totally out of order. The Xiaomo service centres are only in few cities and metroes and being a native of Dehradun(uk) thers is no Service center in my town. So when contacted customer care they told me to bring it to the service center whichever is suitable for me. Its really a bitter experience to buy Xiaomi Mi 4i
0|1|i blindly purchased this fone after reading its wonderful reviews. no doubt this is a flagship phone in this price range. The Display is very sharp and colours are also very bright and deep but at the end of the screen near the back home keys there is a problem and that can only be pointed out in a completely black background. also there is a leak of light due to improper assembling of the display panel. i wish fp could replace my phone but i knw they wont. low volume in external speaker and headphones is another drawback. no slot for memory card. 16 gb internal memory is very less keeping todays needs in mind.
0|2|this device producing heat huge range[44 degrees] ,i dont know how iam maintain the phone in pocket............... and other way screen guard and sim try was not sent my address even i registered...........
0|4|good product with very decent specifications has heating issue... update resolved heating issue but after that phone is lagging in performance
0|5|Very good performance. Display is too good. Camera clarity is awesome.. Money worthy to buy... Sound quality is also good.. No Heating issues..... Planning to buy Mi4i (Grey) also...
0|5|After 14-15 changes , finally my dream phone! Excellent and top notch. The best in business.!!!!. Complete in all features and options, its a pleasure to possess MI4i,better then other handsets in the market in the same price range
0|5|Previous Thursday i booked this phone. Monday i got this phone from flipkart. First look is so impressive. Slim, Sleek, Beautiful beast... Beast is because of his features 1. Nice Camera (Front & Back Both) 2. Good Processor 3. Display great 4. Features are unlimited i cant explain over all i like this phone.... I make a nice investment to buy this phone.
0|4|I have been using MI4i for two weeks now and I must say it is worth a buy. It is one of the best options available in this price range. Along with its slim body and light weight, the most attractive feature is its camera. The picture quality is amazing. The interface is also good. And till now I have not faced any heating issues. But yeah, I don't really play a lot of games. So it may vary as per the usage.
0|5|Its a lovely phone with very good & smart looking in this price range. This phone is very much user friendly & really fast with some heating problem. Battery backup & camera are really good. And also big thanks to Flipkart for speedy delivery.
0|4|Best phone you can get in middle range..its awesome in every way..looks,performance n specialy for its camera..Every android phone use to get heat sometimes..same is with mi4i..Fully satisfied..guys go for it..Worth more then its cost..
0|4|I'm using this mobile since 1 month. Pros: Great look and performance Great features at reasonable price Best ever camera with Full HD Updates from Mi.com to correct any software issues Cons: Little warming up while playing games High use of RAM No root access Suggestion: Don't think much.. just go for it..
1|5|JUST SOME HEATING ISSUES...WHICH CAN BE FIXED BY UPDATES!!! NEVER LET URSELF TRICK INTO BUYING ASUS ZENFONE 2....IT SUCKS...FOR THAT BUDGET...THIS IS THE BEST!!!
0|5|I never used any Xiaomi products before because I never trusted these Chinese and local Indian brand mobiles. But they proved me wrong when I bought it irrespective of heating issues in the reviews. I guess they fixed it with their 800 mb update, so my phone's temperature never crossed 33 degrees. I have used it for 20 odd days but never faced any kind of issue. Camera clarity, display are gorgeous and very sharp. Sunlight display feature of this phone is also amazing. battery backup is for 2 days with moderate use ,I never played any games, so can't really talk about it. Cons: No expandable storage, but xiaomi provides 5 gb cloud storage too, I think this phone is absolutely flawless. P.S: I was a moto g2 user for 6 months which I bought at the same price as Mi 4i,and I can bet that this phone is 1000 times better than my Moto.
1|1|Slow laggy....Design is pretty slim but could not live upto my expectation for normal users its fine but if you are in mood of serious multitasking you need something really good.....Please xiaomi be good in satisfaction and performance not on spec sheet...and please do some serious ram management..getting 300 mb out of 2 gb...are you guys kidding...you must not be doing so..your multi tasking is seriously freezing and frustrating..Grow up.....
0|5|After seeing the reviews of many people regarding the heating issue n all... i Still made a call for this mobile... as the features of this were mind blowing... I didnt find any heating issue n all.. now if you charge your mobile n play games, any device can have that issue,. For me its just wrking flawless... N the camera is 5/5.
1|2|1. Phone is getting heated so quickly. 2. Charge is draining so fast. It is not even withstanding for a day. 3. Photo quality is Good. So overall the phone is not that my satisfactory.
0|5|I have been using this phone for a week now and I have to say that this phone is totally out of my expectations. The display is amazing, the battery backup is nice on moderate use, did not experience any lag after the update, and the heating problem was totally solve after the latest update. Every single game and apps that I've tried are working perfectly fine and smoothly. The cellular device itself looks very nice and gives us a premium feel. It does not feel cheap at all. The volume rocker button and the lock button are made up of stainless steel. The overall looks and feel of the phone is excellent. The sound of the speaker is decent but as it is located at the back of the phone, the sound may be masked if the device is kept at a surface like the pillow or a bed mattress. The Miui is comfortable to use. After updates and importing music and photos counting to nearly 2 GB, I was left with 8 GB of space to install apps and games, but considering the fact I do not play heavy games, it's not an issue for me. Now coming to the camera, while taking the pics and looking at the screen, the camera may not seem good, but the final photos which are clicked by the camera are very clear and detailed, unlike my HTC desire 500 and Tab 4. I took on a gamble by buying this phone and as you can read my review, it paid off. I would highly recommend this device to the one who are looking for a mid-high ranged device at a decent price. And yeah, do not forget to redeem your free screen guard which can be obtained from mi's website by entering your address,phone-no and your mi4i's iemi number.(just google search- mi freebies)
1|1|Pls do not buy this mi4i as this phone has a very serious bug that it is not showing the miss call alert. Mi has excepted that it is a bug but they are not sure that when this can be resolved. Miss call alert is very basic stuff but mi4i dosent shows the miss call & every time you have to go to call log to find if there are any m.call and in log also it shows as a rejected call although you have not cut the incoming call. There is a battery heating issue as well. Battery got heated after few minute use. Do not bye this china phone, it is working like purely china items.
1|1|Kindly add Local Indian Languages in this mobile handset for better Experience. I am from Punjab & can't read Punjabi msg in this handset. Thanks Pankaj Babbar
0|2|Network problem. Data network connects but doesnt work most of the time. No matter which network you are on
0|5|THIS IS A WINNER PRODUCT, NO PRODUCT CAN BEAT THIS IN ITS PRICE VALUE WITH SUCH KICK ASS FEATURES AND OF COURSE WITH SUCH BRILLIANT AND ADVANCE MECHANISM AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST , ITS HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY. HATS OFF " XIOMI MI4I "
0|5|Hi Guys, Writing this review almost after a month of user. Its a great product which is feature rich and specs which are more than enough for the buck you pay. Have not faced any issue heating till date - touch wood. Look and feel of the product is great and doesnt give any feeling of cheapness or chineese loud speaker output is a bit lower. Camera is good. You need to be bit patient for taking high quality photos. battery life is good to ok regards, rahul prem
0|5|its wonderful using mi 4i thanks to flipkart for giving the best phone at relevant price the camera is awesome the HD display is super to watch........ simply super thanks to MI no issues about phone its working quite brilliant and the slow motion camera is awesome wonderful selfies too
0|5|I bought it during first flash sale and after using it for all these days, all I would like to say is that it is an excellent phone with an outstanding camera and good screen resolution, in true sense it is a value for money phone. I strongly recommend it for anybody who is looking for a good phone but does not want to pay steep price for the same.
0|5|(excluding the technical things which u can see on specs itself) The Pros and cons are listed on priority(high to low)... PROS: 1.) (Best pro of all) -Though Mi4i looked simple to use...i am sure u cant find a BETTER GUI than MIUI i.e. U can customize anything (for eg) there are options even to change color of ur notification led with msg/calllogs etc and belive me its jst a start..I bet Xaiomi caught the market not only for its price it was also its GUI. It also have many very useful and creative apps. 2.) Super..duper... cool touch & display like mobiles in range of 40k 3.) Built of MI4I is fantastic (Very Very good looking).. its very slim and 5in size made me lov it (all my friends felt 5.5in phones trouble some and less handy) 4.) Camera super good(met expectations) 5.) Dn kno for others but my battery is lasting for 2 days max (by using 2- 2G sims and some WIFI browsing) dn kno in 3G with internet... 6.)Xaiomi is maintaining a website which is followed ever day and they collect reviews and bugs, then correct it in their next update. 7.)its really rigid...it fell few times from my pocket i cant see even a scratch (not hardcore falls only from chairs and theaters etc) Cons: 1.)No head phones...(Whyyyyy...?) 2.)No expandable memory slot (though 16 gb was enof for me but its still annoying and also they give free 5gb in Mi cloud) 3.)Slight heating issue while charging and networking.. but it was not as much i was afraid by the reviews b4 buying...Though it heats a bit was not a problem for me.. 4.)Sometimes it doesnt check automatically for signal/network which is very annoying i had to click choose automatically (moving from office to work)...and few other small software issues (No phone is perfect..i.e my last phone samsung galaxy has software probs 10 times worser than this) but they correct it often in their updates 5.)Mi4i has been made expecting its customers to use back cover or case...so have to buy a case for sure so it maybe as new as ever...bcas it willl glide from ur pocket without cover..which was stopped after a back case now its perfect. 6.)Speaker is not that loud....its moderate..
0|4|I bought the MI4i after going through all reviews online. Previously I had a Micromax and a Xolo with me. so a Xiomi is sort of an upgrade for me. :-) Coming to the phone. I got the phone delivered on May 26 2015. Delivery from Filpkart was flawless. It came before time and I had no issues with the overall delivery. Now for the features and my own personal experience. 1) First thing that strikes you about the phone as to how light weight it is. It is very easy to carry. 2) Camera of the phone is brilliant. Both front and back, especially the back is too good. 3) The OS and overall handling i.e the touch is very smooth and till now I am not having any issues. Coming to the main part i.e. the battery and the heating issues which concerns phone users these days. The battery will last 1 full day with normal usage. Best thing is the phone charges itself in little over an hour(75 mins) from 0 to 100% charging. Coming to the heating issues.Phone will heat up if you play a lot of games and use heavy duty apps but since I personally don't play that much and use the phone for things Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and stuff, in my own personal experience till now ( 3 weeks), the phone has not heated up that much like my other phones have. So overall till now, a pleasant experience for me :)
0|2|Pros 1. Good display 2. Light weight 3. Battery is good. 4. Camera is good. Cons 1. 3g never works. I have tata docomo and Bsnl, in bangalore both have H+ network. I tried both sims in 3g it never gave me download speed of 40 kbs even. I tried both sims in Tamil Nadu (Salem to Madurai route) and its still worst. I dont think so the phone is good in 3g mode. still need to try 4g. 2. The speaker volume is low while listening to music (either speaker or ear phone) 3. You will not feel the vibration - its too low u will not feel while driving or if it is little way from you. 4. Sometimes using the mobile for 20 or 30 minutes it doesn't heats up. But sometimes without using also the mobile heats up.
0|4|I wanted to buy a new phone for myself. I would read up about new and upcoming phones and all the flagships and all the critically acclaimed phones. But there was just one problem. These phones were great for the US market, not quite for India. I thought to myself no one is making a good phone for the Indian market. And a week later this phone was announced. On paper. This phone is PERFECT. And that was an achievement in itself. To pull off the perfect balance in everything. For me what I needed in a smartphone was all there. 1. Great Battery - Check 2. 5 inch 1080p Screen - Check 3. Good Camera - Check 4. Android Lollipop - Check So I bought the phone. I have been using it for a month now and here is my feedback. My previous phone was a Nexus 4. So my review might be biased in that aspect. 1. Performance: The biggest disappointment for me has been the processor/performance. I bought my father an Mi3 and it is really smooth. This phone on the other hand. Not so much. I mean a year old phone was Snapdragon 800 (8 series is really the flagship material). This phone was advertised as a flagship, and after using Mi3 my expectations were of a buttery smooth flagship experience. But that wasn't the case. It is NOT a slow phone. It is NOT sluggish. But it is also NOT buttery smooth which is what i expect from the flagship succeeding Mi3. 2. Display: The display is amazing. Like absolutely amazing. This was the first time I used a 1080p screen phone and boy oh boy. I'm not going back. The sunlight display is good a flagship feature or sure. The good thing about it was supposed to be that it saves battery which brings me to the next point. 3. Battery: The battery at first I thought was really good. I come from a Nexus 4 after all. I was bound to be impressed. And impressed I was. I was no longer looking for charging points everywhere I went. I went to a trip with my friends. Earlier I would look for charging points in airports, buses, cabs. Everywhere. Now I could travel and just charge my phone once a day and it would last throughout.and have some juice left (approx 20%). My phone outlasted my friends phones which included HTC One M8 and an iPhone 5. I felt my phone was always in demand which brings me to my next point. 4. Camera: The camera is at this price point SPECTACULAR. I mean really. Both the front and the back camera. From what I have used. I have been impressed with the phone's camera. It may not be as good as the flagships. I know because I've read all the reviews, but I don't see the difference. It's just amazing. 5. Heating: Well first thing I did when I got the phone was I updated it. Since then I haven't noticed any heating which wasn't there in my Nexus 4. Yes it does get heated. But Mi has pushed a lot of updates which seem to solve the problem. 6 Miscellaneous: Well the phone looks good and feels light. So there's that. So overall, a good phone. A great buy at this price. Update: After a recent update the battery performance has gone down substantially. Earlier it would last a day with 10-20% juice left. Now the phone's battery runs out in 8 hours. I know it's not my usage which has varied because the battery used by screen is 10-20%. I hope Mi Team fixes that soon. But yeah the phone has got its problems. Or it might be a rogue app update.
1|5|I got the mobile on June 6th, 2015. It was delivered by Flipkart just in 2 days. It is worth buying the model Mi 4i. Some of the Reviews about this phone mislead the buyers. It is not getting hot even if we browse continuously for more than one hour. Display is very good.
0|4|Thank You so much flipkart for your delivery timing its was amazing. Product is very nice . amazing display Nice camera Nice processor and its not heated Great MIUI6 xiaomi finest smartphone . But when i switch on my phone , in black colour something is not good with display. Flipkart please help me on this .. Replace it or do something Bcoz i love this phone .
0|5|.Battery is very good xiomi used the most expensive battery technology for this device this phone is 2nd phone in the world which use this battery technique the first one is Samsung Galaxy S6 but the prize is too high so this phone is a good budget best in its class !! and the other is display the display of this phone is remarkably good 1080 !! And the other this phone is comes with 16 GB this is not a big issue they give OTG compatibility to the device so with can plug OTG pendrive and enjoy !! the phone is very handy and not slippery we put the device in the xiomi hard case available on the official site and the device looks pretty cool !! And the last but not the least the performance of this device we all know this device comes with 2 GB RAM and the Octa-Core Processor this is great combination !! And the last is camera the camera of this phone is superb very beautiful focus color presentation is also very good the front facing camera is also good !! ' All the features of this phone is best at this range 12999 only don't think too much guys g for it !!
0|5|i purchased this product two days back..excellent packing by flipkart..about the product Awesome phone...no lags..no heating problem...great UI.... + Excellent Battery + Camera(front n rear) + SCREEN :Good quality display + Best phone under 13k - No headphones - lack of accessories in market - No memory card slot Update your phone before using it, there is a update of 862mb. IT WILL SOLVE THE HEATING ISSUE ETC.....
1|1|With all your sanity, please do not go for this phone. Put all the exceptional specs tagged with this phone aside now. The phone heats up too much. The plastic sealed slim body doesn't allow the heat to dissipate properly. For 2 GB RAM 1.7 GHz octa core processor, this Phone works very slow. Even the battery drains up in less than 24 Hrs (Normal Usage). And the speakers are the worst I have used so far. Loud speakers are as good as no speakers. Even if this was not enough now the charging pin doesn't work. Unable to charge my phone now all micro USB pins tried. Xiaomis flagship phone MI3 was much better than this.
0|4|I will tell you my whole experience beginning from the unboxing of set till being fully operational as follows - After unboxing the set, i switched the set on the display was really amazing, then i connected it to my wi-fi to complete further steps to make it operational. While inserting the sim be careful as it only supports only nano sim, best part it's a dual sim. Display - 7/7 It's a full hd screen display with amazing clarity. Camera - 5/7 I took some snaps with it but the camera quality what you expect from a 13MP is not so good, even though i tweaked it by taking snaps in HDR mode and beautify mode but still not so much difference, best part always keep cost in your mind. I took selfies with it not very impressive. Charging and heat - I plugged the mobile in charging for at least 3 hrs, device started to heat up. NOTE - I have yet not updated it to MIUI 6 whch is the latest stable update available now. After updating when i plugged it for charging, heat issue resolved. It will take approx 5 hrs for full charging. Performance - 6/7 With Octacore and 2gb Ram this device is a beast to throw on challenges. I installed some games such as asphalt 8 & dead trigger 2 played both games the device performed very good with some unnoticeable minute lags of course during this time the device starts heating up with very light increase in temperature. Tried multi tasking such as running browser then minimizing it and running other apps such as whatsapp,FB, Pdf reader etc. best part was that it didn't closed any of the apps running in the background. Battery - 6/7 While running the above apps there was not so much drop in the battery, example while running the game for 30 mins the battery dropped down to 7-10% which is acceptable, but when doing other tasks for 30mins accept gaming it dropped down to 3- 5 %, Note the battery mode was balanced. Storage - 4/7 This is the major drawback as it only has 12 gb available for use, which is not very much if you will install high end games, store Full HD movies, best part is it has OTG feature which means you can expand the storage depending upon the usage. In my case i bought an 32 gb pendrive connected it through otg cable to device for storing external data such as movies, songs and non installable things. Sound - 5/7 Not very loud but clear. Design - 6/7 Set is very slender with white matte finish and strong magnesium alloy under the hood for protection. And at last the delivery of flipkart was very good, booked product on 4/5/15 got delivered to me on 6/6/15 This was my impression of the device after using it, hope it helps you. Thanks to all in advance for reading it.
0|5|It would be around rupees 25k if the same phone has been manufactured by major brands like Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG. So we're paying just half the price for a beautifully well built phone by Xiaomi. The phone has absolutely no issues. As many mentioned here, it's not over heating, not even before the update and no low ringing volume issue found, the loud speaker is loud enough for a phone. at least with my device. Sometimes there's a little lag in the performance. Yes, only sometimes. My observation: Display is very good and not excellent. Yes, It's visible under the sun light. Battery backup is good. For a moderate user it may run for a whole day. The battery is not 3120mAh as mentioned in the Fk website, it's 3030mAh mentioned on the box. Both, front and rear cameras can take a decent pictures. And has a good set of features. The main camera is equipped with true-tone, dual LED flash – it combines LED lights in white and yellow to deliver better color balance to photos. Light weight, Sleek. Can operate in one hand. Built quality is very good. Very Decent design. The MiUi interface is very smooth. The charger fits perfect withour Indian wall socket. No loose contacts, the pins are thick enough. Felt, 16GB internal memory is quite insufficient without a SD card slot but can live with it as there is a USB OTG feature. ? You may get a free screen protector as a freebie from MI here... http://www.mi.com/in/freebies/ ? Fully recharge your mi4i's battery and update your phone as soon as you take it out from the box.
0|5|AWESOME - other name is MI4I .!! LOOKS LIKE A IPHONE 5C VERY IMPRESSED DISPLAY, HANDY, VERY MUCH COMFORTABLE. NO ONE CAN BEAT IT FOR SURE ! Excellent and crisp display Sunlight legibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup The feel holding itself pretty good, can use d phone in one hand, no fingerprints on the back Full HD display , camera quality is superb with low and bright,glaring light. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Antutu benchmark scored about 39k in performance mode and about 28k in balanced mode... I believe these are pretty good scores in terms of performance + Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS Update your phone before using it, there is a update of 805mb 6.5.6 version. IT WILL SOLVE THE HEATING ISSUE and many. Flipkart guys are awesome as always with packing and deliver. thank you flipkart.
1|1|Hi Everyone, I bought this phone on 30/April/2015. From Day 1 I found this crap having a lot of heating issue with GPU, convey the same to Flipkart Technical team. But WHAT they do. Showed me Battery temp and tried to convince me that there is no problem with handset. Undoubtedly this phone having good spec’s. but please guyz don’t compromise with Heating. Preferably you can go with ASUS ZENPHONE 2. Beware : NO RETURN OR EXCHANGE POLICY Flipkart Provides!!!
0|5|Lets get to the pros right away. Screen : It has got one of the best displays. It even beats the Mi4 & One Plus One displays which are superior devices. It works great and the colors are truly awesome. It competes with the Super AMOLED displays from Samsung (Note & Galaxy S series). You will love the display. Camera : It captures the moments beautifully. Both rear and front cameras as too good. Especially in natural/bright light. Better than the Lumia cameras in this range. However, the quality is not as good as in bright light in low light conditions but still is lot better. Using flash will get you great pics in the low light conditions. Refocus feature works like a charm! Build & Design : Sleek and Sexy! Build quality is great I must say. Feels really good in hand. I hardly felt any weight. Looks are awesome! The device is sturdy. Touch feel is very good. Battery : I'm a moderate-heavy user. I play around 1-1.30hrs of high end gaming and an hour of browsing. Always connected to WiFi. I can easily manage for a day with full charge with some juice left. Muti-tasking : Device has almost 1GB of available RAM. Multi-tasking experience is buttery smooth. Apps open up quick & switching is hassle free. Now the interesting part, the Cons MIUI 6 : It is great I know, but it has got some bugs too and is heavy. The only reason I want to stick to it is the Camera features. Speaker : Speaker volume is too low. Especially the ringtone volume is low. Can easily miss calls. Ear piece volume & quality is great though. Game/Media volume is good. I hope this will be fixed soon. Already the developers are working on it. Heating : This is not a con. I wanted to mention it as most users are concerned about this. I play graphic intensive games and the device does get warm not too hot (with latest update).If you play about an hour or so you can see a bit of lag seldom (Clear RAM before game play). Normal usage, I never faced any issue, no lags nothing. Finally, I'm a happy Mi4i user, cannot take eyes of this display. My opinion, It's a great phone, value for money. I would rate it 4.5*
0|1|I purchased Mi 4i on 25th May and got delivered on 29th May. Everything is fine.As i am wating for back cover and a tempered glass for screen so i am hardly using this phone.But after 5-6 days i found a light Sky Dot at the bottom of screen while starting of the phone & that dot is still there after using the phone for some time as well. Any one found that dot in the Screen , Please tell me.
0|3|Good camera...bad Processor... play a game for 2 mins...switch on wifi for 5 mins....and then u can roast your bread over the mobile screen....Made in China....donno how durable it may be... I give 3 stars for its camera and design...
1|1|Heating alot...Producing more heat if you use 3G or 4G ....You cant handle heat issue...And there is no memory card slot so you can upload only some photos,vidoes etc...Because of this memory gets full so phone gets slow...Dont buy this mobile if you want to store more videos.pics etc...
0|5|First of all Big Thank you to the WS Retail seller and Flipkart for sending my Xiaomi Mi4i right on time and I received it just on My birthday (9th June) . I feel great satisfied with lovely well packed items from flipkart . Everything I received inside box is fine nothing damage - all fine :-) About Device ------------------ - Love the simple and beautiful design ( really fall in love) - Very light weight even having 5 inch Screen wide. - Superb fast in opening apps /games. - Ringtones (inbuilt) are awesome (some people complaint about low ringtone sounds during phone calls - Totally false - I tested about it - really we can increase loud and soft ringtones) - Super fast Camera shot ( Totally impressed - I must say) - Full HD screen , Full HD camera (both front and back camera) , full HD video Recording (both front and back camera) - Very good quality usb charger - Never had problem of heating issue - Torch light (via camera flash) and lots more Some heavy gamers may find no extra expandable memory card slot a bit dissapointment but for me (16 GB) its enough as I am not a heavy gamer - I rarely play games - I am more interested in new and unique Android apps. Overall - Very Good and Powerful Android Phone. Go for it - you will never regret !
0|1|I brought the mi4i expecting the same class of build, quality and performance from the earlier xiaomi products like the mi4 and mi3,. I also have an MI3 which I feel up to now provided the best for the buck. But alas what a disappointment mi4i turned out to be. Within a month and a half the display went dead , took it to Mi exclusive service centre and was told there are issues with the motherboard and the battery, I now have to wait for 3 weeks before I can have it back fixed hopefully. The major issues were :- * Heating, the phone heats up while doing normal tasks web browsing , calls beyond a certain time, and not the least the games , playing them for extended period makes it seriously hot. The issue could lie with the Qualcomm chipset but it is Xiaomi who have designed the phone. * Sound Quality : The placement of the speaker is is on the bottom of the rear side , so you have to make keep the rear side up in order for the phone to be audible . The quality from the speaker is unacceptable there is a lot of distortion in the sound , you can compare the quality of sound by playing the default ringtones from any of the other Xiaomi products, they sound sweet. * Sound levels: The volume levels for both the headphones and speaker are pretty low compared to the other phones within the Xiaomi portfolio and other brands it looks like the programmer forgot to program the correct gain for the operational amplifiers, can be easily fixed via updates. * Battery: My phone drained the battery even while browsing via WIFI. My Mi3 needs recharge ever 1.5 days , but mi4i requires it every day in the balanced power mode. Mi3/4 runs on 2.5Ghz processors which consumes much more power, with the same usage pattern. Results on the ground are different from what Xiaomi claims. * Screen: The attracts more fingerprints , then the rest of the Mi models. If you have oily skin prepare to put a screen protector. * Slow Slow Slow, for the specs it has the phone is slow, takes a couple of seconds to open up mail WOW, scrolling is jerky even the lower models of MI scroll much smoother and open up applications much faster. All the benchmarks are useless and have no meaning unless you have good UI experience with the phone. The positives :- * Good build quality and the screen colors. I feel Xiaomi engineered this phone in a hurry to fill in the 10-15,000 Rs range and hence have compromised on the engineering and the QA. Maybe I was unlucky and got a lemon but then it is a QA issue.
1|4|I have been looking for a new phone to replace my old Nokia 701. An android was the choice obviously and finally narrowed it down to Xiaomi. Just happened that the mi 4i had just been launched and got it from Flipkart. I have to say that I quite like the phone. It is light weight, weighing less that the older Nokia which was not a 5" model. The MIUI interface is a delight to use, making the transition from Nokia to Android very easy. Downloaded the MI PC Suite to integrate the phone with my PC. But that connects only via USB and not via Bluetooth. The bluetooth integration with my car's hands free system was fuss free and works well. I like the clock app that came with the phone. You can name and set alarms like in older phones, but also name and set timer alarms too that wasn't possible before. The games played well for my daughter, with no heating or battery problems.
1|1|I am recived the phone 9th june 2015 for Mi4i, some technical problem, i can't recived the phone bcoz phone is very heating.when the finish the call that time phone is not switch off, so i can return this phone, i am not happy this product quality also not good.
0|5|MI4i.. I bought it on the open sale by flipkart on 26th may and it got delivered on 30th may (ws retail is the best seller, seldom it ships a broken or faulty piece unlike other flipkart sellers). the phone is extremely lightweight, it has a classy display and MIUI 6.5.6.0 is a perfect bug free stable update. those who say it's heating..i don't know, but I got d miui6.5.5.0 d moment I switched it on n it hasn't heat up at all.. speaker volume is d only flaw in dis headset, u hv to calibrate it using *#*#6484#*#* and then it produces an acceptable output. camera..impeccable! the front cam has age n sex recognition modes n even advises u if u hv miui v6.5.6.0 for selfies..the rear cam is as perfect as my note 4..its a sony/Samsung combo lens n xiaomi has done brilliantly wid it. for a day I used it wid d screen cover n d proximity sensor didn't work perfectly sometimes, then I searched miui fprums, I was told u hv to remove the cover before usage (its mentioned on d screen cover too)..I removed it n it works perfectly now. the mi4i is an exceptional device...m a huge fan of memory cards n I was skeptical abt buying a phn wid no memory slot...but then, 12.5 gb (after 6.5.6.0 update memory n battery life has increased) alongside a 32 gb dual otg pendrive was worth going for it. it's better than yureka/honor 4x/Lenovo a7000/asus zenfone 2/moto g 2nd gen...d sole reason...hq 1920x1080 display..crystal clear camera..n a stable lollipop interface. go for it...ahh yes, d package doesn't hv a headphone n I unfortunately bought mi orange basic headphones...dey r a disaster, don't buy them. I use sennheiser cx300 n they produce a thumping experience. I also bought d mi band...n not much impressed wid it either. but mi4i handset...go for it..dnt believe negative reviews n buy it! p.s. I sold my Samsung note 4 just coz its a single sim handset..nothing personal, but 2 sims r a must these days..n its a great handset too!
0|2|i hv been using dis product since 1st of june n i hv faced major problm regarding network issues...its vry vry poor.n sound also not good.other things r awesm.
0|5|Battery - Last about 3 days or so - How! ( Security > Battery - turn on the time scheduler, Turn to marathon at 10.30 till 7.30, turn off from 12 to 6) Sim - 2G with Wifi on during the day. lasts long really long Weight - just 130g ... very light weight. looks and feel very good. Memory and Speed, its good. I dont think i will ever need 16GB memory. its more then enough. I am yet to update to Miui 6.5v .. still on 6.0 and its great. In Short - This is a very good Phone. People are writing all sort of things, but i thing you cant find better, good work Xiaomi.
0|4|This is very nice phone but not too great, but its reasonable for this price margin, Camera is too good....no heating issue.......and its very stylish phone, if u want a stylish phone,pls go for it with out second thought..........
0|5|After updating the software, there is no heating occurs in the phone. High display quality Awesome camera(front and back both) 16 gb is enough , if u want to store many songs and videos LightWeight and slim Battery quality is also good Very good at this price and i suggest u to buy this one.
0|5|Very happy with this phone. Battery life is excellent, speakers are decent and camera is awesome. Overall very happy with the purchase and flipkart delivered it in one day!
0|3|I have been using this phone since few days, I immediately noticed lag in UI, the UI is not that smooth as I thought, I see lag while switching apps, click tabs. Installing themes makes it even worse. I feel Asus, Lenovo are better in this price segment Pros 1) Phone design 2) Loud Speaker 3) Camera 4) Battery Cons 1) UI - slow, to much hype 2) Slippery - need case
0|5|Ordered this phone on first sale, April 30. Got the delivery on May 4. Was a little doubtful about the build and quality of the cell to buy without prior reviews. But it turned out to be an awesome surprise. Pros: Great build, looks like a high end phone. You'll know it once you hold it in your hands. Screen/display/touch is simply perfect and gives a flawless user experience. MiUI makes the display all the more beautiful. Camera is good with a very precise focus. Works like a perfect point and shoot camera both outdoors and indoors. Front camera is good as well. Cons: There are a couple of software bugs. Sometimes screen gets locked when on a call, doesn't unlock till the other person ends the call. Sound is not very clear when using speaker for calls. Battery will not last more than 24hrs with heavy usage (WiFi, gps, some games and some music). It does get heated a little while charging and when running heavy apps. Can be ignored when you are getting this for 13k. And most smart phones get heated for that matter :) MiUI themes look to be heavy and not many are good. Overall, there cannot be a better phone than this under 13k. Don't waste your time looking for better ones if your budget is around this. I'm sure future updates will fix the software bugs.
0|1|i paid 30 rupees for gift wrap but there is no gift wrap waste of 30 rupees and i wiill advice dont waste that money
0|4|Good: 1) Dashing look 2) Light in weight 3) No heating problem 4) Front Camera is good 5) Battery is good Improvements: 1) Music voice is slow 2) Back Camera is not good
0|5|Awesome Phone Great Screen Awesome Camera both front and back Great Battery Some says that sometimes phone get heat up, yeah they are right,but u can reboot the phone and it will work nicely
0|5|Great phone with excellent features... awesome cameras. Fron camera too good. Just loved it Bought one more for my sister
0|5|Hello It is nice product as expected if there is option for External chip and EarPhone it is best but i got value of my money. Delivery is also good before time.
0|3|been using this phone for a week now well the build quality and the ui are impressive battery back up is ok not good not bad screen is superb camera is good but the biggest grouse is the sound quality n the pathetic volume u might be sitting in the same room and u would still miss calls coz u just cant hear this thing ring and if u prefer listening to music on this phone forget it .....its pathetic gaming on this is good though it stutters randomly though with this specification it shouldn't overall a good phone for this price but cox of the speaker quality it spoils what could have been a great product i will not recommend this only coz of the speaker quality
0|4|Firstly, kudos to Flipkart for delivering the product within 2 days time. Appreciate this kind of super fast delivery services. Coming to the product, the overall appearance of the phone is strikingly attractive, slim and neat and above all extremely light. And the best part is one need not open the phone to slide in the sim card or fiddle with the batteries, the advantage being the battery is inbuilt. The camera of the phone is just fantastic. the images with the front camera 5MP are pretty good. Truly happy with the picture qualities. The phone has a call recording system too, that impresses me and it comes quite handy to me at my workplace. Some cons: You dont have an option to expand its memory. The phone comes with an inbuilt 16 GB memory out of which almost 60% is used up by the phone applications.
0|5|This mobile is simply awesome. Battery and Charger: It comes with a 5V and 2000 mA charger which is very fast in charging a 3120 mAh battery. You can also charge your phone up to 40% in an hour. OS: Unlike Samsung, you can expect the immediate fixes and may be they will release the next android also for this. Design: Simply awesome slim design which is having very great look. Drawback: There is a little heating issue even after the update, even though they claims that they have fixed it with the recent update, but not to the large extend. No expandable memory.
1|1|I have purchased this phone on 20 May 2015 1st week was ok than device shows its real value not charging more than 50 %. even after 6 hours of charging 3G internet speed is less thn 2G. overall the phone sucks. flipkart told me to reboot the phone. but still the problem persists. PLEASE DONT EVEN THINK TO BUY THIS PHONE!!!
0|4|> Camera - The front camera is too good, the exposure option is very effective. Rear camera does a decent job too with the double flash. > Features - accommodates most of the high end phone features, what more can we ask for in 12,999!!! > Performance - NO LAGS absolutely.. smooth interface easily enhances the performance of the phone, a good multi-tasker > Display - 1080 dpi HD!!! Do i need to say anything more, the Sunlight feature works just fine. > Battery - decent battery back-up. A full charge runs 16-18 hours with moderate usage. Camera, Video play and WiFi sucks up the battery at some pace though. Also it take around 2.5-3 hours to full charge > Storage - 16 GB internal and around 11 GB user memory is more than enough for a someone who doesn't game. However no External memory is a con but it connects OTG pendrive which compensates for the con. > Heating - Yes after a continuous usage of camera, wifi, charging and gaming the phone heats up in about an hours time, but the good thing is it cools down within 10 mins of stand-by > Speakers - slightly disappointed with it, the external speakers are not loud. Overall good for the budget it comes in. Pretty happy with it so far!
0|3|Pros: 1.Excellent display 2. Nice call quality 3. Light weight and sleek 4. Front camera good 5. Off course Miui feel Cons: 1. Speaker volume very low for ringtone 2. Gets heated easily but not too hot for a basic user. 3. Camera not at par with standards set by Xiaomi . 4. A little laggy sometimes 5. Low storage for people who store a lot. (OTG available though) Verdict: Overall its seems to be an average phone now but MI may make it better with the updates. My suggestion: Wait for few updates and check en.miui.com before buying.
0|1|Total disappointment.Settings gets hanged.doesn't open at all or takes quite a long time to respond.I could not Connect wi-fi because of some problem.My refund request has been rejected.I am instructed to follow their mail to fix the problem which is cumbersome for layman.Their customer service personal will call you at their scheduled time which may not suit you. therafter they will not call you and postpone it to next day.This problem continues to me for the last four days.Service centres in selected places is also a major bottleneck.
0|4|I got this phone on first sale Apr 29th . Got delivered on May 2nd Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Pros : 1) Very good display. Crystal clear. Readability in sunlight also good 2) Screen response is very good 3) Front and rear camera is good 4) Handling high end applications/games without lag at most of the time 5) Good sound o/p when we listen songs in earphones/headphones is good. 6) Phone built is very good. Phone looks sturdy and stylish 7) Battery is good for Avg use. Cons: 1) No external memory card - Big minus. When we have HD recording, which fills memory at rapid speed, support to ext mem card is very much needed 2) External speaker sound is very much low. At times not able to hear ringtons as well. 3) Hangs sometime when we launch multiple apps 4) Initially phone was heating up more. After upgrading to latest version, this is much better now
0|3|Bought Mi4i, had a display problem.. with nominal or acceptable heating of phone.. Then got it replaced flipkart..thanks for that quick service...5star for flipkart service Then replaced phone... "Heats up like anything"... as its cpu is on top right behind your small speaker...when you go to pick up the call its already hot and ears skin can feel it as it very thin... Screen is smooth multitasking is has some lag but cool... Good.. wont be buying Mi phones again though... Regards
0|5|It's is very good performance wise and Camera Quality also too good.People who all going below 15 K they can prefer this phone..Futures are ultimate and excellent. Thanks for MI.
0|5|I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, the charger had some issue's. They could not replace the charger alone - so they offered to replace the whole phone + accessories. I was a very refreshing experience. Thank you Flipkart !
0|3|the phone is just awsm in looks.. easy to hold. but tend to heat very much,.. we dont need a heater in room.. its enough.. like a hot pan... camera is mind blowing.. back n front no words.. just go for it if u r a camera geek. ram always more than 700mb free... performnc is good. but heating while gaming.. batery is ok.. its not giving me backup like a 3200mah batry will do... display is amazing.. crispy.. good saturation.. pure clr's.. not over saturated like amoled.. display is very good 5 star..fr 13000 bang fr the buck... but service centers are a big issue.. come on mi.. give good after sales support also.. iam using a redmi 2 also... all so good... give other colr options also... i should have given 5 star if the heating and sound is resolved...
1|1|battery of this phone is getting worst day by day.. in just normal use battery drains within 15 hours. and also phone gets restart sometimes... last update of 6.5.5.0 has increased the battery problem... i have put a replacement rquest to flipkart. bt they have not been proved themselves as good customer friendly these days...
0|4|Got the phone for 12k, and delivery was quick from flipkart. Mi4i is very light and handsome mobile, initially there was a heating problem. but after MiUi OTA update, it seems like heating problem is reduced. application working and performance are wonderful, and display is very brilliant. Got a good camera too, but i felt it is not upto the mark. also u wont get a headphone in the pack nor any flipcover. (so 4 stars) To mention, anTuTu benchmark scored a near 40K, which is also excellent. these are my initial comments, will put more after a long usage.
0|5|Hi All, I have ordered this phone on May 25 flash sale and got it delivered on 26 May. Since i got a defective piece(Light Leaking from Bottom right corner) returned it and got new phone. Thanks to Flipkart and WS retail for Fast shipping and Replacement. I have been using it for 3 days and My observations below: 1.Update the phone to Latest Firmware and start using. I dont face any heating issue. Am from Chennai , Summer here is damm hot . Outside even i get heated up and so does the phone . Plz dont state this as issue. Even Galaxy Note 3 get heated up here in chennai(My frnd's phone). 2. I bought this phone mainly for Display and believe me probably best display u can get under 25k. Looks like amoled display. Excellent build quality and Speakers reasonbly louder. No issues. 3.I dont play highend games . I will stop with Subway surfers and COC . So am not facing any heating issue. But i will always be connected in WIFI or 4G end even then its not heating much . 4.Call quality great and Signal reception is good. U can customize this phone like hell. Tons of themes and Customization option.MIUI is great. 5. Camera is simply great. Both front and Back does great job. Only downside will be Limited memory option. But its bearable. And always keep in mind u r Paying just 13 K ... Then u will appreciate this Device. Thanks XIAOMI!!!!!!!! Thanks, Ganesh M S
0|3|yes it has the best specs, but some competition is catching up (meizu m1 looking at you) Pros: 1. sunlight display: amazing legibility in sun 2.colours 95% gaumet ... love it. 3.overall build and quality. 4.packaging was perfect. 5. HATS OFF to battery life. more than one day of normal use. BUT Cons. a. MIUI is not as fluid as you would expect it to be. there are jitters and micro-lags all around the phone. thought this phone could replace my nexus 5. it might be capable. NOTE:(this might be because of an update they released to tackle the Heating issue, so they tuned down the processors, sacrificing some performance. ) b. volume and power buttons are SOO CHEAP feels like you are playing with toy buttons(exaggerated to make a point) c. Camera, not so much as advertised. d. Capacitive buttons Meh. in this year, it should have moved to on screen buttons , but that's just personal opinion. e. If only xiaomi would release an ASOP stock android image for this phone, i think it could have done much better. f. again personal opinion Snapdragon 615 vs MT6752, MT6792 is about twice as powerful, cheaper, and lets out LESS HEAT. so Meizu seems better option.
0|2|Bought this phone in the 1st sale writing this review after 1 month of use. The phone really is a worth for its money. Ui is good and smooth apart from some lags here and there in animation. The snapdragon 615 processor is decent if you use only productive apps (like Facebook , whatsapp , viber and other common apps). If you are a gamer type then this is not the phone you should be buying. Xiomi guys show asphalt 8 running on this device which is a trap as it runs with many frame losses and gaming experience is very bad. Coming to the build quality its bad as after 20 days my front camera stopped working. Thanks to flipkart i got a replacement in 3 days. The new phone which i got was defective too. The display screens light is leaking from the edge of my phone and when tapped gently near the rear camera you can hear a sound of some vibrating spring. These problems which i am facing is common to many users and miui forum is filled with people facing same issues. I have again asked flipkart for a replacement. So if you are buying this phone to use only for a year buy it because i doubt it will hardly run after a year. Apart from some defects in build quality the phone is awesome in look and feel.
0|3|Good hardware and all but not up to the Mi experience I've had with other Mi phones (I own Mi3, Redmi 1s, Redmi Note 4G). I'm reviewing this model as compared to the other Mi phones, as they set the bars high in most of the parameters. Not comparing with any other Android device. 1. Rate of battery consumption is higher in this phone. Have been receiving quite a few updates and I do see slight improvement but not like Mi3 or Note. 2. Camera is good. Camera has been good on any Mi phone. Even on the cheapest of the lot (Redmi 1s had an amazing cam) 3. Feels slow. Visible lags and quite frequently. Boasting a good processor and GPU, I had expected more but it disappointed. My Note feels faster. (And I'm not referring to any of the performance scores here. End user experience is what should matter most) 4. Heating issue was definitely there (though, doesn't bother me much) but after a recent update, it seems to have come under control. 5. Build quality is acceptably good. Not great, but alright. Other models felt sturdier. May be it's because of the lighter weight. Which I'd prefer over anything else. Makes the phone handleable. 6. Screen is good. 7. Seems to hog more memory than other models. At any given time, even after clearing any running app, more than 1GB of phone's memory remains occupied. The only difference in the software of this model and other Mi phones is it comes with Android L. So, can that be the cause? May be. But, I'm sure, with the super active support that Xiaomi provides, these nagging issues will be fixed.
0|5|My Experience: Just Awesome - No Overheating while using the phone - Excellent camera and display - Great battery Not sure why mi is releasing only the white version though.
0|5|After using it for almost a month now, i can say this is a very good phone. It has excellent display, camera and has not hanged with multitasking. Really satisfied with the phone. So far i havent even experienced much talked heating issues. Battery is heaven. Overall i would say just go for it, u can't get a better phone in this budget.
0|3|Speed of the phone is very nice. Look is also good. Everything is good in this phone but battery life very very poor and also heating issue.. It is not 3120mAh. The battery might at max have a 1500 mAh capacity..
0|1|the battery spec mentioned on the website and on the actual product delivered are different website spec of battery is 3120mAh product delivered with 3030mAh
0|1|I have seen the reviews and by mistake taken wrong decision and paying for all this heating headache.I suggest every one not to buy this phone and buy problem with your hard earned money.take a wise decision before you buy this phone.Flipkart delivers fast ,but quality of the product is big question mark here
0|2|A good handy phone but neither the flipkart team nor the Internet service provider team are able to solve the issue. Would request Flipkart to resolve this or give me a replacement!
0|4|I received my phone within a day of buying it. Kudos to Flipkart for that! I'm writing this review after using it for a week. Cons: -Firstly the back is white AND YOU REALLY NEED A BACK COVER! It feels heart wrenching when a white like that is your only option! -The phone feels quite sturdy in the hand and has a solid build. But i noticed that the volume and power buttons are a little creaky. But nothing much there, pretty sure they'll last. -The phone does heat up to an appreciably high temperature when used for around half an hour for any purpose, be it gaming, calling, taking pictures or even just scrolling through settings. It does get irritating at times.. -NO expandable memory, keep this in your mind and you could go for the Moto G2 if you want to carry all your media around. This phone has OTG support if you're into carrying pen drives to watch movies. -RAM. The deciding factor for some of you! 2GB seems awesome but it might be MIUI or something else but the end user only gets around 700MB of RAM. Initially you get around 1GB but as i installed WhatsApp and 6 more apps,it kept on reducing! Most of it is used up by the system! Notes: -MIUI keeps getting updates and the heating issue might get resolved soon. I actually got 2 updates in the same week. So better get your hopes up for that and the RAM issue! Pros: -The Camera is pretty good for the price and the average size of an image captured is around 5MB.( You can roughly estimate the quality from that) The front camera too does not disappoint and clicks on great selfies! Dual-True tone flash gets the details of a picture almost in the same way our eyes perceive the image to be! -MIUI is a pretty good skin and adds tons of features of which I'm pretty sure I've discovered around 30% of them after a week's worth of use! Customisibility is High with this one! -Look and feel is great! Feels quite premium! -One handed use is really good as it just reduces your usage area on-screen to either 4 or 3.5 inches. However small your thumbs are, don't worry. They got you covered. -Did not experience any lag at all during a week of intensive installing and deleting apps! -You can un-install inbuilt Google apps and others to free up space! (Yay!) -Sound from the speaker is loud and clear even at high volume. Appreciably loud, but not loud enough to disrupt parties! All kinds of music sound good on this! The Mi Sound enhancer works magic on any earphones you own to give you a good song too! Verdict: Two words-" Simply Awesome " If lack of an SD card slot is not a concern, then this is the phone for you! If it is a concern, Moto G2!
0|3|2 stars less than 5 for the sound quality of the speaker. Its sound is pathetic. One cant hear sound on speaker. And if it does not offer a good calling experience than how can one rate it as a mobile phone. More than this it feels shy for changing from WiFi to 3G sim network. I have to reset the signals every time I use WiFi. The quality of this box is very good on this price with a good full HD display and many more. Mi should offer a mobile with these feature with added calling capacity and network management. If you do this your phone will sell even for 13000 bucks instead of 12999. I regret not buying Asus zenfone 2 due to 2 mm thicker body.
1|5|Please dont look at the cheap reviews of over heating and others. Its a true beast. Enjoy speed. Its a really good mobile.
0|5|I have got Mi4i two day before and having following observation 1) The material which made by the phone is having quality material and quality finish and worth of money 2) super quality display 3) sound of the phone especially ring volume is low. this might done for the promotion of the MI band which is selling for 999 rupee separately 4) elegant design and slim phone 5) This phone has little heat while charging and operating it but i have updated the latest update which having 850 MB size and solved the issue after that so i would like to request to the comrades for patiently handle this issue before judge in to conclusions 6) i have seen several commentators written that omelet can make over the phone this is utterly out of sense. i have seen a you tube video where one of the comrade has measured the temperature rise and it was 2 degree rise(32 degree) after the 1/2 hr continuous calling and usage. so watch every review in you tube before you judge 7) price is worth comparing with the features 8) no provision for external memory but it has 16 gb internal memory and it is sufficient for me 9 OTG supported so we can attach pen drive 10) little bit similar with Apple 11) i wish i could get black color 12) user friendly and have more options compare with samsung and sony 13) i have sony xperia duos M and it was made up of cheep quality plastic got for 13000 and when i got mi4i i have so impressed with the material , quality and finish overall impression is .... worth of money and please go for it thanks and regards Gireesh
0|5|Brilliantly Designed, Extraordinary, Everything Seems Flawless,(except external storage though it is a taste thing)... Go for it without any doubt .
1|4|Mobile is Good. No heating problems, No Hanging Problems, delivery stander was good, pack also good. No head phone, it was not mentioned too, but should be a headphone with it.
0|5|I am owner of MI3 as well as MIi4i. Mi3 is awesome phone with less heating issues. I bought this mi4i in First Sale and mi3 in its last sale. Then I have spent sufficient time with both mobiles. I like its reverse tethering feature. MI4i is dual sim and advantage over mi3. Mi3 is faster than Mi4i I started same game on both mobile which shows that Mi3 is faster than Mi4i. Benchmark on antutu also shows that on 32 bit. If we compare Internet of same sim 3g on both set then Mi4i is little bit faster. MI3 looks awesome but MI4i is handy phone. On some hardware specific apps MI4i shows 4.9'' Screen. Speaker location on MI4i is back which does't boost sound. MI3 Sound is higher than MI4i. MI3 Silver color finishing is also awesome but Mi4i is not like so. There is not too much difference in Mi4i and MI3.
0|4|Excellent service by flipkart. Booked Mi4i on Monday afternoon, got the phone Tuesday morning. The look and feel of the Mi4i is really good. Camera: The camera is really class for this price range. It has many options. Heating issue: I have Moto G 2nd another phone. I played few games on Moto G and Mi4i for more than 20 mins. It was common to see both phones become warm. Took around 25 to 30 photos, no heat generated. Browsed for more hour, it was warm, which is expected in smart phones. Voice clarity of the phone: It seem to be bit low. Ran the latest updates on it. Will see how it goes and post another review a week or 2 weeks later.
0|1|frequent drop in data speed on both WIFI & mobile data. need to turn on and turn off mobile data or wifi for each page while browsing. gets heat like anything while charging , calls and camera. flipkart technicians are forcefully rejecting requests got so irritated with it. my phone has problem with data connectivity and that technician ask me to use smartchek app without any issues. i was unable to share reports he says its problem with mobile network.
1|5|Writing this review after having it for 20 days. Absolute cracker of a phone in this price range. Performance is uber great. UI is too cool to keep your hands off the phone. And How can I miss to write about the camera. This phones front camera, back camera can be easily compared with Iphone 5s camera. Impeccable colors in pics in day light. Also, in night time, if you know how to operate in manual conditions its perfect. 441ppi is the display resolution which marks the distinctive quality of the phone with the price allotted to it. Battery is more than ok. I am more than satisfied with it. On 3g network it last more than 24 hours , and on WiFi it last for more than 40 hours using it heavily. About sound, it's sweet. More work could have been done on that department. Rating.. 9.5 on a scale of 10.
1|2|Biggest Flaw is placing speakers towards back of the mobile .. you can't even hear ringtone at all .. trust me even if you are 2-3 feet distance you can't even hear the tone .. if you are in sleepy condition forget about call .. unless you have to place the phone reversely For god sake who want to place their phone reversely on table and use it O.o even though reverse usage sound is very low .. Screen is pretty good since it is sharp provider i dont need to talk about it .. one of the best screen available phone is handy and feels pro .. but as others says heat issue .. it might solve by updates or not .. m' not sure about it .. please make a perfect phone and add smart features to it .. don't do such silly mistakes mi please ..
0|3|Recently we have purchased MI 4I in the flash sale and unfortunately it has fallen and back case got broken. Then we started searching for service in Bangalore and found its address and phone numbers. We tried to talk to service center to inquire about the back panel and most of the people in service center are not answering the call. we tried for two days and visited two service centers. One in Bannerghatta Road, infront of IIMB, where the person doesn't have enough information to address the problem. Then went to service center in Koramangala where those guys where pathetic. Token system was for the sake. They are not technically qualified. Not addressing the actual problem. Addressing the problem for the sake of it. No customer is happy or satisfied with its service. Xiaomi might have got good numbers but they are definitely failing in service and their products are not of good quality. I could see so many complaints in almost all the models. I have decided not to buy or recommend Xiaomi products to anyone.
0|5|1. First of all there is no heat issue after software up date. 2. Great device with awesome display and MIUI. 3. Apple fan boys may love the device more than anybody. 4. You will not feel it like a 13k device as its touch and UI makes you feel great.
0|1|I Brought this phone one week back but unfortunately its Disappointed me, there are lots of hardware issue like Microphone is NOT WORKING properly 2. Display gets continues FLICKER when ever i connect to headphone 3. PHONE HANGS playing games 4. overall phone is VERY SLOW
0|1|This is extremely buggy, (Gave 2 stars for overall looks) Dual 4G are wasted here, MI4I phone is not enough to capable to switch different speed E > H > H+ > 4G, its just simply failed to connect network. (It just works for first 20 Sec while switching speed mode manually or reboot). Believe me friends its damn damn frustrating, especially when you need internet and its not connect at all. Pocket dial prevention mode, waste feature I can say, many times it's just dial here and there. Phone Heat, Phone heating is very high on performance mode. PS:- I've updated my phone twice in last 1 week and currently using MIUI V6.5.5.0 (LXIMICD) PSS:- I've already check with Airtel on the connectivity issue, the airtel engineer came at premises and check signal strength no issue was reported on signal its just phone is having issue.
0|1|Full heating issue for any usage , this is after new update , not worth if heating issue is not resolved , and miui also not working some times
0|4|Thanks to flipkart for a speedy delivery.Got the product by 48hrs from the time of Order. Fingers crossed, was all waiting for the flash sale on 21st and got through, ordered One piece after a lot of reviewing. Here's my rating for Mi 4i: Build Quality 3.5 / 5 Speaker 4.5 / 5 (I would give it 5/5 for front facing Stereo Speakers) Display 5 / 5 (441 ppi , Full HD 5" JDI Display) Speed 4/5 UI 4 / 5 You will love the custom options on this phone if you've already used Android before. Themes 2.5/5 Icons 2/5 Camera 4/5 Memory 16Gb (10Gb user accessible) - No Expansion Slot, that's good enough 4/5. No Headphones In Box :( 0/5 No Screen Guard In Box (had to search a lot before buying the right one) 0/5 Music Player 5/5 Camera Effects 4/5 Battery 4.5/5 (Comes with 2Amp charger- Charges Faster) Mi 4i is the best configured device One can have at the Quoted Price in today's Market. Will post more after some usage
0|4|but only if the heating issue was solved it was a great product. even using whatsapp heats the phone. while playing bomb squad and fractal combat temp went from 37 to 46 degrees. and also...it does shows lollipop 5.0.2 but its features are negligible.
0|4|The Phone is good in design with features like 2 gb ram, Octa core processor, dual sim etc. I read several reviews before buying....some positive, some negative. But I wud say I dont regret my purchase. Good and esay to use. Stunning design will aww other people to ask you about the phone. Even people have written about heating problem. I hv not figured out much heating problem, but still phone heats up sometimes. But its not much a big deal. PROS: Handy 5" screen. Easy to use Interface. Awesome Camera Quality. Dual sim Functionality. CONS: No memory card slot, Batt Slightly lower than Xiaomi Note 4 G.
0|5|Mobile is awesome in all aspects. Only one minor drawback is the heating issue. It gets hot after20-30 mnt gaming.
0|2|Im rewriting the review, After my concall with Flipkart about the issues that i faced, they didn't follow up on return policy or moneyback. In fact my complaint was called off internally without my consent. I believe I cannot continue with Flipkart, As its seeming very difficult when it comes to issues of product. If you are good to them, they are happy, minute you raise any issues, your are the villain. Pros : within budget, Lightweight, Cons : Battery Heat while updates, Use memory Usage by the system, Not more then 2 app multi tasking Display Blank once a day, Doesn't perfom like smart phone. have to restart the phone. Not suitable for gaming Battery Heats up like hell. Return Policy / Money Back Policy is NOT WORKING
0|1|ON THE THIRD DAY OF PURCHASE "SETTING" OPTION NOT RESPONDING. MUST SAY CAMERA AND ALL IMPRESSIVE...BUT WE ARE NOT PURCHASING PHONE FOR TAKING PICTURES WHOLE DAY. TOUCH IS HANGING SEVERAL TIME .....POOR PERFORMANCE WHILE MULTITASKING. I DONT KNOW WHY FLIPKART IS PROMOTING SUCH PRODUCT DAY AND NIGHT. OK I GET CARRIED AWAY BY PROMOTION BUT FINALLY RETURNING.. LET'S SEE HOW TEAM WILL SUPPORT NOW. EVEN FLIP KART IS NOT GIVING OPTION OF MONEY BACK..ONLY REPLACEMENT...DON'T CARRY AWAY BY ADVERTISEMENTS
0|1|IT HEAT UP TOO MUCH , AND AFTER UPDATING STILL ISSUE NOT RESOLVED. SPEAKER AND PHONE VOLUME IS VERY LOW CAN'T EVEN HEAR RINGTONE IN PUBLIC PLACES, AND CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY WEAK. TOO MUCH OF GRAINING USING CAMERA.
0|5|I liked the UI, it has no launcher, all on desktop arranged. the moment i connected to wifi, its ready for a new update from MI the camera is good, best I would say, it has feature of fs/2, thats the best ones. control shutter speed where is ight is low Video has fast and slow motion recording like the iphones. Theme can be download from MI store (free as well as paid ones) Gorilla Glass 3 is perfect Radio is fun Android 5 is aready experinced on Nexus 5 No headphones so you can choose yours own and setup in settings I connected RADIO to my 2.1, voila after a long time, nexus 5 didnt had any earlier Scanner inbuilt Compass is a addon after using Nexus 5 Dont know where it has CONS so far.
0|5|Superfast. Very Sleek and the entire phone comes in your palm grip. Battery life is full day. you get all the features of Rs 60,000/- Smartphone at Just Rs. 13,000/-
1|5|Believe me guys.. This is a very good phone for this price range. Don't compare with high end mobiles (Sorry i don't say like that :) ) . This gives competition to all high end mobiles without any drawbacks.
1|5|It's simply a superb mobile in this cost. A quality product too. I expecting a Headset that's missing as usual. That's the main disappointment I think. Heating is legible and good too. Overall it's a Good product in this price segment. . . . . Ks
0|5|Pros 1. Slim and compact finish 2. Excellent camera quality(both front and rear) 3. Battery charges quickly and it retains almost 30 - 45 hrs. 4. Worth for the price. Cons 1. Phone is getting heated up after few minutes of usage
0|4|Excellent quality, superb camera. Different from stock android phones. Decent battery back up. LTE compatibility on both sims is really good.
0|5|I bought the Mi4i on 14 May 2015 and after using it for a week i am reviewing the phone. Also Great delivery by flipkart as i got the phone within 24 hours. Mi4i is a really superb for any normal phone user. By normal i mean call,message, camera, music and almost everything else apart from gaming. I cannot comment on gaming as i am not a gamer. PROS 1. Looks brilliant. 2. Great mix of Apple and Android 3. User friendly 4. Can multitask easily 5. BIGGEST- Great value for money ISSUES 1. Phone heating- Heating is within normal limit for normal usage and definitely not something to worry about for non gamer 2. Call volume- Yes. It is slightly on the lower side. But most of us keep phone in our pockets most of the time. So a really minor issue. 3. Space constraint- Users can use an external USB 4. Service centers- Cant comment as not yet faced any issues. CONCLUSION- Go for it. It is an excellent phone.
1|1|1-I bought this phone on 14th may sale and they offered me expected arrival on 20th may but it delivered to me on 16th may. 2- I though this is a best phone I bought but after 3 days using this phone I can not here any song. when I am trying to play video or game or music after 5 or 10 seconds the volume automatically down ( volume is still on high level 15 but problem is same) even I can not here when I plug it on speaker or headphone. and heating problem makes me mad. I don't know what to do but all I can say that I heard about this company a lot (MI) but after using there device it is not a good company after all Chinese products are Chinese . We can not aspect more from them... Now I want my money back or please replace my phone.
1|1|After 10 Days Used Display Like Negative ,Music Stopped Many Times ,Loading Launcher And Many Problem
0|5|It is undoubtedly the best phone in the market under the 15K segment. I have been using the phone for 8 days now and yes, it did have a heating trouble while making calls and charging, which has been solved after the second MIUI update, which was preceded by the v.6 MIUI update of 800 MB. Pros: Great Camera (the front camera is better than so many phones I have taken a selfie with), Light weight and great performance. I am not an avid fan of heavy mobile games, but Temple Run/Looney Tunes/Simulator run very fine. I am also impressed with its battery life, which is a drawback in a lot of phones, including Zenfone 5. Cons: No expandable memory, so you may have to move your pictures and videos in your hard drive in every two-three months. Even though it has Android Lollipop, but you may not like the MI user interface.
0|5|Pros : MIUI is best OS. Received update from vendor specifying improvements done. Camera is very nice, beautify mode is superb Sound on earphones is very nice. Cons: Nothing
1|2|Hi, I got delivery on this phone on 18 May 15. I updated the device to Latest (MIUI 6.5.4.0) before use. Pros : - Very sharp & crisp display (ultimate experience) - Dual band wifi - Sleek Body - nice looks - Good front & back camera Cons : - Heating issue - The device is a heater. The fault is in design only. The phone is so tightly packed that their is no space for heat to go out. Phone heats up high in just 2 minutes of normal use only. You cannot put it on ur ear. - Loudspeaker - Loudspeaker fades out and volume goes down automatically and you cannot increase it. Overall a phone is meant for calls and if u can't speak properly then all its features are of no use. No not a good buy for general use.
0|5|Pros. 1.Awesome device. Great build quality, quite slim and easy to use single handed, best camera I'v ever seen in mobile phones. Front camera is also great. 2.It has new OS update near about 800 MB which need good data pack, although it can be downloaded in chunks, you can pause and continue any time. Do that update. It works perfectly without any issue. Display is awesome better than iPhone 6, can be viewed from any angle. 3. No any heating Problems as some people have written review how it heated, it gets heated only when you use camera for longer period, but it's not too much, and only upper part of mobile gets heated. I don't see it as problem. 4.If you are looking for great phone having budget more than Rs.20000 still you should buy this phone..It is excellent mobile in every category. 1. Although phone doesn't hang in normal case, but it hanged once when I configured back to back 3 gmail accounts and at the same time allowed synchronization. It didn't respond for about 20 minutes, I could not even switch off it's display/standby. 2. In my phone FM doesn't seems to be working I tried several times, but it doesn't catch any signal, on using my office headphone, I hear little bit radio city with lot of noise. Need to check at other places with some headphone, without headphone it never worked. Update after use of near about two weeks of use: 1.It gives LTE, 3G or 2G options on both SIM slot. 2. Also Battery supports about 3030 mAh which is good for 5' smart phone, goes for a day on normal use with 3G. 3.Screen guard of tempered glass is still not available although preorders are being taken by graphenearmorglass.com. 4.Back covers of karpine white color is great and touch feeling is great. I prefer black or other dark color to avoid becoming dirty. Best luck
0|5|The phone is best example how complicated a gadjet can be. The screen is crystal clear, brightness is fantastic. The MIUI features are mind boggling. The camera features are awsome, especially the re-focus option is out of the world. Sound is best in its class. The phone is sturdy and the battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with high usage. Its a definitely a yes phone for true feature lovers.
0|1|I have received the phone on 5th of may 2015. The front camera is a defective one. I have requested for a replacement so that there is 30 days replacement guarantee. But the customer care of flipkart is very poor. They told me that the technical team will call me with in 24 hours. For the past two days they haven't called me. They have given me a invalid pin no for the smart check application to verify the genuineness of the complaint.
1|2|phone is good but ..its too much un bearable heating issue ..that i am still other fone for calling..afraid of its heating..doesnt make it great....and in my fone..there is a charging problem...after 7 days itself it stopped to charge.... i asked for return a suggestion to flipkart..plz before selling any product....use ur self atleast for one month...its a matter of ur trust... i am not happy with this fone
0|2|It's my first MI phone , but not found a batter option. I was very exited about the phone but the looking and feel of the phone is like a cheap plastic Phone. I am not at all feeling speed of 2 GB RAM. Icons and the display seems similar to Redmi-2. In short if you are willing to spend 13000 , chose some other option.
1|1|Options in MIUI 6 are pretty good but there are lot many bugs. Mobile is getting heated a lot even with very normal usage.
0|1|I bought Mi 4i on 14 may, After using for 4 days its front facing camera quality is degraded. lots of lil dots are showing on screen when using fornt camera. Dont buy this product,
0|4|I had bought the Mi 4i in the first flash sale only and was amazed to see the display quality and camera performance. But after some days, while using the mobile in dark, I noticed a little illuminated line below the BACK and HOME LED buttons. This is a minor manufacturing defect so i opted for a replacement. I got another device immediately after 2 days. I was happy to see a quick response from flipkart but upon receiving replacement I found a similar issue in the device. So again I requested for replacement. The request is still pending but I want to suggest Xiomi and Flipkart to do some quality check before sale. Such an awesome product like Mi 4i is getting blamed just for such minor issue. Hope they will come with a quality product next time.
0|1|Touch---- fine Processing--- fine Camera---- not even compete with 5MP Heating is an issue Sound quality... very poor Even Headphone not provided Flipkart must confirm the quality of the product before they selling new products, i m totally disappointed with this. should have option to give negative rative in flipkart - Very disappointed
0|5|Highly confused at first place before buying this Mi 4i a newly launched,lesser known brand and a CHINESE phone. But with fingers crossed I ordered it and received it on 18/05/15. Unboxing was unusual as there was not much to do. As you unbox ,you meet your phone and beneath it 2 piece Charger cum USB and thats it. There is a pin too which has a funny but Vital Role later. Now about phone 1.Looks * * * * ( it looks good and compact) 2.Weight * * * * * (130 gms, really thats remarkably cool) 3.Display * * * * (Good,not much to say) 4.Touch * * * * (good) 5.Functioning * * * * * (flawless) 6.Hardware * * * (Power and Volume keys could have been more robust) 7.Camera * * * * * (Tremendously fantastic,specially low light situations....see pictures I have taken from it on Instagram " Vatsalneo10".) One of my major concern was its service centre,which I found it easily and Nearby in Sec 18,Noida Final Comments 1. Best phone to be purchased. 2. I even compared it to iPhone 6 and 6 plus, do it yourself and I am sure you won't be much disappointed.(Specially check for the supported WiFI network types, 'ac' is given only in two phones in India and one being iPhone 6 plus). 3. Octa-core processor is still not provided in many others. 4. The experience would have certainly enhanced with a provided Headphone. 5. The temperature rise during charging occurred once bt not for long. Rest to be found out after further use...........
0|1|no vedio calling heating problem++++ gets hanged when you call someone, you have to wait to other person to disconnect call, otherwise no option to disconnect
0|5|No heating issue as all people are saying but I don't find any heating..... Grete cam(Front and back both are so cool). Very light weight the most impressive If you are planning near 13k than go for it.......
0|5|Hi Guys, I bought this phone on 07th May Sale keeping in mind the heating issues but I know my usage very well and also I did checked out the Mi 4 at the Local Mobile store. Mi are lookers I can tell you and will get noticed easily. I'm not that tech savvy but with regular usage (Which in my world means a bit of WhatsApp, You tube videos for my Kid, phone calls for close to 15-30 minutes at a time and useful surfing and No Gaming at all so far. I'm not addicted to games or to phone so battery and heating issues so far is nil to me. I can easily carry this to my office even if the battery life is at half (9 Hours plus driving to/from) and come back with between 20 percent or more still there when I charge him. Camera is excellent and touch is butter smooth, no lagging or hang till now. I've Grand, Iphone 5s, Iphone 4, Lumia 620 and Samsung Lumia as well and all users in my family felt this one is certainly a worth buy keeping price in mind. Specs are good for me and will be more than enough for average users - Five stars. Also got an email from Flipkart for free Screen Guard which will reach within 14days.
0|1|Plastic waste with lags in performance and also heats when boots, charges and usage of apps . Camera with low light extreme horror and service too pathetic. Lot of better options with this price range and do not waste money.
0|5|Camera - 5/5 Front Camera - 5/5 Dual sim support 4G Support @ Both sims (GSM) Display - 5/5 Battery - 4/5 Great build! Octa Core Processor 2 GB RAM ~12 GB space (delete unwanted browsers [inbuilt / Google Chrome] to enjoy complete 12 GB space Overall great phone. Please do the 800MB update to avoid issues (heating etc.)
1|1|The specs are good evrything is cool with the phone BUT, it heats up so much you cannot put it on your ears even after 5 mins of use. Please don't buy it unless Xiaomi decides to fix the issue. The processor heating up right from the first day is a big Red Flag for buying this product. Invest your money elsewhere.
0|1|HEATING LIKE ANYTHING JUST ONLY IN TALKING. CAMERA IS FINE BUT I HAVE NOT PURCHASED A CAMERA I HAVE PURCHASE A SMARTPHONE BUT ITS LOOKING LIKE I HAVE PURCHASED A HEATING FILAMENT.
0|1|1.Camera is not good. 2.Phone is getting heated. 3.Unalbe to view Free or used ram memory. 4.Unable to view some full videos and disturbance of pop up of settings page. 5.No expandable memory. I am completely Unhappy with camera and its 13000 cost worth features . Mobile cost is too high with less features.
0|3|A great phone for heat therapy and massage for fingers. I have RSI (Repetitive stress injury) problem in fingers and my fingers have pain and doctors has advised me to daily dip fingers in hot water. Now I do not need to do that because I have this phone! It heats up after few minutes on normal usage too. You can't take more than 4-5 photographs. It heats like hell. But then I am using it positively! Hope it treats my finger pain. But what about those who don't have this pain? May be all of us may sometime get this pain due to overuse of fingers for mobile and laptop/desktop usage. Use this phone for "prevention is better than cure" The phone interface and everything is so brilliant. It has feel of legacy. Flagship feel. Colours are little towards pink hue even if rich. So hope that can be corrected. So this is phone with awesome features and heat therapy
0|5|I have use mi4i for 2 weeks and following are my experience.. -heating problem while using camera, call and high graphics games. upto 43 C -camera is pretty decent and clear m loving it. -Battery backup is good and charging is fast. -Display is the best part of it as it is too smooth hadn't seen such display before. -Phone doesn't respond sometime while playing high graphics game with wifi on. -net speed is too fast as other. ..... solutions to problem: --Uninstall FLipkart, Flesky and Google chrome... as its browser is better than chrome. --update into new and stable version.. yeah update came the day i got it(pretty amazed). --the design is good n is too light. -- and it doesnot have a SD slot because phone with SD slot tends to hang more so there r no SD slots in iphone too.. At last you wont get a better phone than this n hurry up u will get free screenguard if bought now
0|1|The phone heats up a lot while on use and also while on charge. There is a minute electric shock near the camera while charging. Now after just two weeks the touch isn't working.
0|5|First I would Like to say that this is My 2nd Android Cell in past 2 years and I am Really Very HAPPY with MY Choice to BUY XIAOMI MI 4i. And these are the Reasons for My Happiness. 1. Display = Special Words to describe it " Beautiful, Colorful, Sharp n Vibrant 441 ppi JHD Display" You wont get anything better than this under 20k. 2. Camera = Rear Camera clicks so True to Life Pictures n Front Camera Quality is nothing less than a 8 MP even if its just 5 MP. 3. Performance = No Lag and I'd rather say that its Buttery Smooth, NO HEATING ISSUES AFTER THE UPDATE to 6.5.3.0 MIUI 4. Battery = its like I dont have the Battery in Cell but instead as if i have Plugged the Power Cable to it cos No Matter how Much Ever You use the Cell, the BATTERY JUST WONT DRAIN AT ALL \m/ 5. Design = Very easy to Hold n use it with One hand :) NOTE = its still a Mobile Phone soo Dont Expect it not to Heat At All After heavy Gaming Sessions. Play Android games for 1 Hour max Continuously cos Games are meant to Be Played on PC's n Consoles n not Mobile Phones. Final Verdict = JUST TRY YOUR BEST TO GRAB THIS BEAUTIFUL MASTER PIECE IN THE NEXT SALE :)
0|5|Best phone in its range, guys just don't believe on what others are saying about heating issues, its offers you a very nice and crisp Display, with a powerpacked Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Dual-Quad core(Octa Core) Soc pairing with 2 GB ram, you will not see any type of lag switching between your apps with a battery fabulous Battery Pack but yet Xiaomi managed to create a beaut, believe me anyone who met me and deen this phone just said What a phone Man. But however it could be my good luck also that i've got a good piece, otherwise many other peoples have got defective piece, So, thanks God for that. But still you cannot get better Specs on paper as well as at your hand than this Mi 4i. Thanks For Reading ;)
0|1|heating heating heating heating This is not a phone of this worth. heating hanging all are there. NO REFUND POLICY.
0|5|First thank you Flipkart for your as usual timely delivery. Received within 24 hours. And now to all buyers, this is my first step to Android world and i am not disappointed at all. Few days back Mi4i was no where into my wishlist as there is so much offering in that price range to consider. But recommended by few friends, i went for this and am overly happy now. Though its my first Android, am not sure if i would be able to help you guys with my review but still as a phone user, i would like to point out what i felt. 1. People creeping here for its heating issue, yeah when i unboxed the box, it started heating without even reaching on home screen. Me too was worried coz heard alot about its heating issue. But did the update and heating issue is poof!! Guys before creeping over its heating issue, please update the OS. Your review misleads the buyers. But yeah playing games it does get a bit hot but thats okay since i found the same amount on every Android device. 2. It takes3 HRS to get complete charge from 0-100. And am using wifi on which its giving me backup of 11 HRS with regular usage on Balanced Mode. Yet to try Performance mode. 3. Absolutely handy, fits well on hand. 4. Light weight and looks great. Cons: 1. No earplugs :( 2. It doesnt comes with screen guard :P but Xiaomi gifts you one as a freebies once order gets delivered which will take few days to reach you. Over all : Am pretty happy with my purchase. Its worth paying 13K for this rigorous machine.
0|3|after 6 day usages issue i faced . Cons: 1. heating when you play game for more than 30 min (i played fight! - from angry bird). 2. heating issue when charging . Pros 1. call quality is good So if you dont want to play game a lot or use internet a lot then go for it .. As heating is so high that if you are playing and some one calls you you cant pick the phone as your ear will get burned ,those staying in HOT climate it is a no no ..
0|5|People here have already gone on here about how awesome the phone is. I have used this beauty for 1 week and trust me its all true. I will try to keep it short. Pros: 1. Beautiful piece of hardware - a total eye candy! The look and feel is just amazing. 2. Best UI in the market currently for Android 3. Super Light. Almost makes you feel like you are holding one of those dummy display phones. 4. Good Camera. Gives good photos in low light and amazing ones in good light! 5. Super smooth functionality. 6. Very high level of customization offered. 7. Incredibly display. Full HD people! 8. Just take a look at the specs and try to accept the fact that you are getting all of this for just 13K. 9. The best value for money deal available for smartphones in this range. Cons: 1. Only about 10 GB storage available for use. No expansion slots provided to ensure SD cards dont slow down the phone. I dont store too many videos on my phone so not an issue for me. But could be a deal breaker for some. But guys I seriously recommend giving this phone a try despite that. You can always use the OTG capability or even back up your data periodically for the space issues. PS: Heating is not a major issue as some people are saying. Gets warm during charging and heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary. Souldnt be a major issue. PPS: Bought the phone cos of the specs and reviews plus the price. Fell in love with it the moment I got my hands on this magnificent device. Not a biased reviewer. Just someone who wants to help fellow countrymen make a good choice. Cheers!

0|5|Awesome phone with this price range ! camera is decent, brilliant display...so far good and i recommend this product from XIAOMI
0|5|I bought this mobile on 7th flash sell and got it delivered on 10th Sunday. After using 7 days with moderate to heavy usage my experience is very good. Pro: 1. Light weight.Smart looking slim mobile (this may vary person to person) 2. Performance is excellent. No lag at all in my experience even with heave usage of game.(Although I am not a gamer) 3. Heating issue: There is a lot of concern in users regarding heating issue. I have updated the mobile as soon as I started using it. In my Opinion definitely it heated up with online streaming on HD video and hard gaming, but it is natural for all smart phones. My older Galaxy Grand or my wife's HTC E8 dual also heated up equally. Moreover with such a slim phone's Octacore processor and 2GB RAM with 2 sim transducers and wifi used simultaneously it is expected to generate heat. 4. Display: excellent display with FHD even under sun. 5. Battery Backup: One of my reasons to buy is battery back up. It is not supplied with 3120mAH battery rather with 3030mAH battery (Flipkart should correct this information in website. This amounts to noncompliance). With moderate usage with all time Wifi/mobile net on with 2 sims and all time sync with 2 gmail, whatsapp, fb it is going on for more than 24 hours. The battery back up increased after 3-4 full charge/discharge cycle. 6. MIUI user interface is absolutely fluidic with lots of customization. (far better that touchwiz I used in grand duos). 7. Camera is good with lot of options for post processing also including post-focus, Slow motion. 8. Scratch proof Display: I kept many times with trouser pocket with keys or coins. But no scratch till date. Cons: 1. Only white colour is available. 2. The speaker volume should have been louder. 3.There is no option for increase in memory (Around 12 GB available after the loading but again NOT A DEAL BREAKER). 4. Although the SAR value is within the stipulated limit, it is on the higher side. 5. Xiaomi should have supplied headphones with the pack. Conclusion: Best buy at this price. Performance wise I can say as good as flagship phone HTC ONE E8.
0|5|A perfect Budget mobile form Mi mobiles. I ordered the Mi 4i mobile on 14.05.2015 at 2 pm and the product was delivered on 15.05.2015 at 1.30 pm. Flipkart is one of The best online Megastore in India. The Mi 4i is a awesome smartphone with great display, camera and performance. I also read about the heating issue through reviews but in my opinion, it is not at all an issue even the great branded phones will heatup a lot. The design, quality of manufacturing of Mi 4i is very good and moreover its a full value for money. I proudly say, I am one of the owner of Mi 4i smartphone.
1|2|I wright after 3 day use of Mi 4i phone good one is nice looking and handy problem is 1.Net connection, 2.Heating problem, 3.Audio is not good, 4.Require frequent reboot. I sending requiest to flipkar, I hope flipkart may sole regarding my problem.
0|5|AFTER 1 WEEK OF USAGE FIRST I COME TO THE POINT SOME PEOPLES ARE SAYING THERE IS A HEATING ISSUE AND THIS DEVICE IS A HEATER IT ACTUALLY DOESNT... IT SLIGHTLY GET WARM NO HEATING ISSUE :) MY 1ST IMPRESSION IS PROS : * EXCELLENT DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY * STUNNING CAMERA FRONT & BACK... * SUPERB BATTERY LIFE * VERY VERY CUSTOMIZABLE UI RUNNING ON 5.0 * DISPLAY IS VERY VERY CRISP & THE SPECIAL THING IS IF U TURN OFF THE SCREEN IT LOOKS TOTALLY BLACK THAT GIVES U A RICH LOOK.. CONS : * 16GB ON BOARD STORAGE BUT FOR ME ITS ACCEPTABLE... * MY ONLY CON IS LOUDSPEAKER IS LITTLE LOW BUT ACCEPTABLE :) THIS IS THE 4TH DEVICE FROM XIAOMI :) 1S,MI3,NOTE THN NOW MI4I.. I LIKE MOBO PHOTOGRAPHY.. I LOVE THIS DEVICE CAMERA COMPARING TO ALL OF THESE.. THANK U MI & FLIPKART
0|3|I was one of the first to get this phones through flash sales in India. Great phone great software. But has some issue with 3G network...Currently disconnects often with Airtel 3G connection in Karnataka usually very often...
0|5|I bought this phone during the first flash sale and have been using it since. This phone is feature packed and comes at a unbeatable price. The screen is amazing, and has rich colors. The speakers and the buttons on the phone are well designed and of high build quality, offering a great user experience. I shifted for a Lenovo K900, a phone which was double the price of this phone and I must say that this phone gives an equal competition or even sometimes better performance than phones of a higher price range. There is a slight heating problem which happens only after more than 30-40 minutes of gaming. Battery performance is very nice and it does give a long standby time, even while gaming the battery drain is not so much as compared to other phones. The MIUI apps are good and the UI is very nicely designed giving a rich user experience.The phones does not have root access, so for all the people using lucky patcher, you might have to do without it. But Xiaomi does give root access to its phone, they launch a developer ROM on their website which can be used to gain root access without voiding warranty. Just have to wait for that. The dual sim switching is good and the signal reception is great with very fast network switching. Also guys Xiaomi is giving out freebies on their website for Mi4i users so grab them before they run out. I can go on and on about this amazing product, giving it 5 stars and hope you guys get one of your own.
0|1|MY phone hangs in every 2-3 hours even i can not attend the calls, where is 2gb ram 64bit 2nd gen octa core processor MiUi 6 is very heavy userinterface it gives nice feeling but verry laggy sometime my phone's soft button doesn't. Work properly and this phone heats a lot!!! What is this same on you xiaomi!!!!! you can make fool not good phones
1|4|After 3 weeks usage I face few problems 1. RAM is occupying 1.2 GB all the time out of 2 GB 2. Heating issue MI might fix this issue in coming releases. 3. Big Issue: Speakers sound is very low, before release of this mobile I thought sound would rocks but it is failed under this section 4. Size of the software (Loliipop) is more, should be reduced 5. Other than MI launchers phone is freezing and lag 6. Camera is not that much clear in low lights
0|2|Hardware is good but of course a copy of iphone 5c. But software MIUI is the most crappy software, Apps crashing for no reason phone reboots automatically sometimes that too for no reason some times apps won't work, you either need to restart or factory reset some times phone consumes always 1GB of RAM with no apps running in background where as iphone runs on 1GB of RAM If you play games the phones heats up very fast. Xiaomi has made big fool out of us saying Mi4i comes with Lollipop, even after uprading to 6.5.3 i don't find not even a single goodie from Lollipop like project volta(battery saver),no buttery smooth frame rates,no material design, no encryption and many others. If Xiaomi wants to expand to international market they should better concentrate on their quality of software and updates, they should learn a lot from cyanogen in this regard.
0|4|This product is great. Performance is good. Battery is good for 1 days. No hanging issues. Am not a game lover so i didn't have idea about gaming performance. Overall performance is super...
0|5|Xiaomi mi4i is a amazing product with reasonable price. It makes to people a excellent smart. It has excellent performance.
0|3|It is very surprising that the company is not providing Headphone with the phone and FM is not working without headphone.
0|5|The form factor, the display *sigh* and the performance! I have found no issues with the phone till date. Yes, the camera part (that's where the motherboard is housed) heats up slightly (and i mean slightly) which is no reason for concern at all. The camera and sound performance is great too. In all, 13000 for the Mi 4i is a high quality handset at a dirt-cheap price.
1|4|I am not a big techie, heard a lot about Xiaomi MI devices, decided to go for it. As of now, I am happy with the device. I will talk about two things which users are complaining about whereas the rest of things are flawless. 1. Heating :Slight heating issues but every other smartphone running on high specs have this issue. As the performance increases the load on the processor increases, it is simple as that. Xiaomi service says the phone temperature should not go beyong 50 degrees and as of now it hasn't. 2. Battery : Awesome!! I downloaded loads of apps , installation , played angry birds. Still delivers. I am not a high end gamer so can't comment on that end. And ya don't forget to update the phone as soon as you receive it or else you shall be sitting in the complain panel ;)
1|1|phone was slim and good look but the sim card slot was horrable one we insert the sim we didnt take out that because this was so tite there was given a pin for remove to the sim slot that was not the best route to pull back the sim card tray
0|5|An excellent product by Xiaomi, I am very much satisfied with this mobile, this is premium mid range phone, why to pay Rs.26K for same specification of other branded phone, if your budget is limited to Rs.15K look no further just buy it, few reviver have reported heating issue, honestly I did not experience heating issue after 2 days of heavy uses, battery capacity is excellent it last more than one and half day. Make sure you update the software soonest to get the best result of this mobile. For those who are looking for more storage may opt additional OTG pendrive "Sandisk Ultra Dual 16 On-The-Go Pendrive" (smallest in the market which work flawlessly). Update: Difficult to find genuine accessories, Filpkart please pay attention.
1|4|1.battery issue,charging stop automatically after sometime. 2.sound is very low,even cant hear phone ringtone. 3.heating issue while charging,browsing,& at the time of camera using.Heating we feel 4.camera also not very good.result of the camera not like 13 mega pixel.is like 8 mp only. in night or low light there is noise in the image. 5.no expandable memory. Other things are ok. If solve this problem then it is very good device.
0|2|Camera is below Average, Rear is too cheap Display and Battery is good, but Cant compensate other flaws. Better to have Samsung Galaxy S4, which is now @16,499/-
0|5|Value for money, just a reminder of how overpriced other major brands are!!! Exceptionally good camera - really good quality; front as well as back. I could get one in the first sale as well as in the second sale - I have been using it from the first sale. The much discussed heat issue - every phone gets heated up after using high graphic games and yes, Mi4i too get heated up. I have been using Samsung for a quite long time I have faced the heating issue in those phones as well, which is pretty much similar. The only issue I feel is the 16GB, which would have been a 64GB and adding up another 2K found have been ideal deal. Thank you.
1|1|not working as good as advertising ...very lagging in processes .......some app is suddenly close automatically ......
1|1|Before two day i had purchase mi4i phon on EMI but now i have facing some problem in this phone. speakers are not working. plz dnt buy this phone.
1|2|I have gifted "Mi4i" to someone and for the first time in my gifting history this gift has embarrassed me by coming back to me with the name of a "BOILER". It is a good quality, compact, very well build and HD screen boiler, which you can bring anywhere with you to heat the water and your pocket. If MI/Xiaomi people are reading this comment then it is a request to resolve this issue as soon as possible and convert this BOILER into a SMARTPHONE.
1|1|After spending money and waiting for flash sale with great enthusiasm you buy what to have it a duck. Pros : Elegant design, Light Weight. Cons: Heats up quickly without any activity, battery drain fast, Not all good camera compare to other xiaomi phones. Memory is very one fourth of the space is covered by MIUI updates. sound quality is poor. You have to be in lonely place to hear the sound. Its an advice please dont buy it because spending money on this phone is not worth.
1|1|flipkart is best in replacement policy as i purchased last phones but HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED for WORST SERVICES in flipkart I am giving review after 10 day uses and update (Aprox 1 GB) Heating issue not solved after update, This phone is only for normal user (Camera and Looking), This phone is very heated for 1 ) Game lover 2 ) Calling duration is more than 15 min 3 ) If you use phone in day light
1|2|too be frank Company have to provide headphones with it which is missing part in the box OVERALL HEATING ISSUE WITH THIS HANDSET YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE IT WITH IN CHARGING YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR 5-10 MIN FOR COOL IT THEN USE
0|5|Enough of bullshit... I am using this for last 3 days and its a wow... No Heating after upgrade and its working perfectly fine. only thing I noticed is charging time is more compared to my previous mobile. Rest ... Fantastic...!!!
0|5|Enough with the pros and cons. This review is to address those who have unnecessarily given this phone 1 or 2 stars. If anyone finds this rude, then I am not sorry at all. First, you are getting a phone at Rs 12999 which has the features of a phone of Rs 25000. The build quality, call quality everything has awesomeness written all over it. Second, the screen is better than that of Apple's Iphone. Even the touch response is superb. U wont find a better screen at such a price, infact this could well be the best display u will ever see. Third, the heating problems, well every smartphone does heat up a bit. And after updating, I dont think there will be any heating problem. U need to understand one thing, this phone is not for power users simply bcoz of 11gb internal memory. But you should have checked it before buying. Multi tasking is fine but if you a heavy gamer then you need to adjust with the heating problems. I got this delivered today and trust me I am happy that I bought it. This is my first Xiaomi phone and I couldnt ask for anything better. So, people who are looking to buy this go ahead without any worries. U will be mesmerized by this one. I will surely update within a week if there are any genuine problems. Appeal to all the other reviewers please donot give 1 star or unwanted reviews. Check everything and then post your review
1|2|Brought in the first flash sale..here are my observations after few days of heavy usage: Pros: 1) Excellent display - certainly the best 1080p display I have seen south of 20k! 2) Solid config at 13K - configuration wise a very good value for money. 3) Excellent selfie camera 4) Good build quality, excellent feel in the hand - lightweight poly-carbonate body. Seems, it can withstand a couple of drops before giving away. 5) Good standby time. Overall, battery life is satisfactory. Cons: 1) Heat: Lot of people complained about the heating issue, and certainly that is a problem. Heats quite a bit even with non-intensive usage (certainly, heating during 3d gaming is acceptable, but during talking with 3G off - thats a bit problematic) 2) WiFi Signal: Weak, very weak. Drops completely at same place where other phones show 60-70% signal 3) Low Speaker phone volume - terribly low sounding speakers. Sure to miss out on ringing when outside 4) Similarly, sound over headphones (tried multiple), the volume is pretty low and also, audio quality seems to be mediocre 5) MIUI - not a very big fan 6) 10-11GB usable space - that is a constraint. Xiaomi could have provided atleast 32 GB storage. 7) Noticed some bugs, like sometimes heard my own voice through earpiece. Didnt happened frequently, but still a matter of concern 8) Poor primary camera - images looks ok on the phone, but when viewed on a computer, they look smudged. Especially, pics taken indoors. Difficult to believe that its some Sony sensor taking these pics (as claimed by Xiaomi) Overall, perhaps a good buy under 14K, but it has its own set of problems/compromises. Personally, I am not very satisfied or rather not very happy with the purchase. I mean, I would have preferred spending few bucks more to get some other brands even if specs would have been inferior rather than getting Mi 4i...
0|5|phone is amazing but i got a faulty one. there is problem with the screen of phone, as the screen does not fit well at the bottom of the phone. overall a good budget phone from xiaomi.
0|5|After using for about 2 weeks Pros: 1) Price 2) Look - Very Slim and Beautiful 3) Display Quality - Color Reproduction- Full HD is very good 4) Camera - Beautify Feature is really good- Auto focus is Fast -Slow motion available 5) UI - 90% Of UI is very good 6) Battery - Easily goes up to 1.5 day 7) Call Quality is good 8) 99% times it did not lag. Cons: 1) No SD- Although I don't need so does not matter for me 2) Gets Warm While using camera and charging but not a big problem. Overall its value for money and You will not regret if you buy this phone. I am enjoying and very happy with this phone
0|4|Thanks for Flipkart and Xiaomi... for this great phone but i have raised the replacement request B'coz...of my screen panel and outer edge not fitted perfectly.. their is a gap like hire crack size... i am worried how to secure my phone from dust and water... and i observed when navigation keys on...and lights...come outside the phone from bottom frame... Hope Flipkart helping me in this issue... and resolve my issue... I am user of REDMI 1s , Redmi 2 and now MI4I.. Thanks - Suhas
0|4|Its not an excellent /must have product, as shown in the launch event video. Major problem is heating. Heats while gaming and using internet, but not on calling. Cameras are OK. Display is great, battery is also really good. Slim, nice to hold but heating problem is really a drawback especially when we pay 13k
0|4|Coming from an user of HTC Wildfire S, S3 and Note 2. After using Note 2 for two years, I have developed a disliking for any phone more than 5 inch frame. So, i have been looking for a light phone and between the 4.5 and 5 inch frame. It is such a bad idea to use such large phones. Only good stuff in that range available are iPhones but cost prohibited me :-( Love the Nexus series but the Size of Nexus - 6 is a big no. Didn't want to go for a LG phone. So no Nexus 5. Bought Mi 4i in first sale and have been using it for a week now. Good -------- 1) A very light and sleek phone. You don't feel it in your pocket. 2) Great design and awesome MIUI interface. You wouldn't feel it in your hand and very easy to use with one hand. 3) First grade front and back Camera with a great software supporting it. A selfie from front camera is much better than many phone's back camera photos. 4) Awesome Display and butter like touch. 5) Very good battery, during few of the less usage days, didn't charged it for two days straight. 6) The accompanying charger helps in charging it fully in 30-40 minutes. Bad ---------- 1) No microSD slot, so people like who are big on photos and my own stored music have limited options. 2) No Mi 4i Pouch/Cover/Case available with sales or even now. With the kind of limited sales, there are no available covers yet from third party. I loved how Moto gave the awesome magnetic cover with the launch of Moto G Gen2. Gifted the phone and cover to my mom on the launch day itself. Everybody loves the cover more than the phone :-) 3) Performance is also not very good. Specially for somebody coming from Note -2 usage for two years. It took ages to install Play Store Apps or loading some Performance heavy app such as Quora. Ugly ----------- 1) Heat Heat and Heat !! 2) With a slight of high usage e.g. Long call, YouTube videos it heats like hell. You can not keep it to your ear after a 15 minute call. 3) Signals: It has some issues with receiving the Signals. It doesn't work well in low strength area. There are occasions when every phone in the room has working mobile data and people are watching YouTube but Mi 4i is struggling to even load a page. I have start receiving complains from friends and family members that my phone is off at few times a day. Never ever i was out of range or switch off with my Note -2 or S3 or Wildfire S. I thought of returning it because of the heating and signal issues. But because of lack of any other good and affordable choice in the 4.5 to 5 inch size, holding the thought for some time now. As i am not into mobile gaming and long calls, i am OK with the phone for now. For those rare long calls i use headphones as everybody should do to reduce the harm to your brain :-) A good value for money but for heating and signal issues.
0|1|After taking photos from camera,Unable to see preview of photo and unable to see photos in gallery. Phone was heating too much for minor operations. Screen Touch was not so much great. Android Lollipop OS in this Mobile,not that much great.
1|5|all are good bettry is good camera gives me the excellent quality you should buy it charging fast and very cheap as compare to other phones
1|4|I have ordered 2 pcs of Mi 4i. I am using Samsung S3 and S5 at present. The phone feels good in hand and is easy to hold. Screen resolution is nice. I found the interface of the phone a bit dull. Fonts are small and the notification panel icons are highlighted very less when turned on, making it hard to distuinguish whether the feature is turned on or off. The good: i) Light weight ii) Nice screen iii) Lots of option for customization iv) Useful pre-installed apps. v) Nice battery backup vi) Price vii) Very good front camera for selfie (Much better than my S5) and the Bad i) Back is dust magnet ii) Front glass although claimed to be scratch resistant but easilt gets scratches. iii) Although speaker sound doesn't distort but the volume level is mediocre (still better than S5) iv) Back camera is not that good. Color are under saturated,low light pictures are noisy and dull. v) No expendable memory is a headache (Less than 12 available storage). Hope these points help to decide whether to go with the phone or not.
0|5|I have bought this product last week . believe me guys this is one of the excellent phone i have used in my life...very nice satisfactory feel and design of the phone.dual sim options are very nice for calling and messages. camera is great.battery life is also very nice. i dont find any issue with the product till date. I would recommend this product
0|4|except heating slightly on some occasions, like when charging and taking photos continuously. I have not tried games on this mobile as I am not a game enthusiast. I could say heating is not at all a problem. I am so much impressed by the performance and great display.
0|5|COMPLETELY SATISFIED ! value for money,nice design build and display!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)))
0|5|I have helped a lot of people purchase phones around me in the past few months. I'd help them buy the best phones available at that particular time: Moto e-g, Redmi 1S-2, Yureka One Plus etc. I was waiting for a phone that I could convince myself to buy. I saw the Moto break its screen fairly easily, the Redmi 1S heat up and the lack of sensors on Yureka (important to me). I sat through the online launch video of 4i and it left me pretty mesmerized. I knew that I was not going to buy OnePlus and so 4i would be my second best option. 16 GB is kind of low in this day and age of Full HD videos but with usb support, I was sure I could overcome that requirement. So, I took the plunge and I am pretty happy with my purchase. I'd like to point out a few things that I have not seen covered in reviews so far: 1. I have pretty sweaty hands, but despite of the fact that the back cover is all white, I have not seen any smudges so far. And even with my small hands I am able to do most of the tasks on this phone. 2. The launch video suggested that they have done something about the sound. From what I understood: most phones have their speakers at the back. But if you put the phone on a table with speaker side down, the sound gets muffled. This has been improved in 4i, and it is pretty noticeable. It still does not work if you put it on something that muffles the sound e.g. pillows. 3. The sunlight visibility feature is really an improvement above all the past devices. I sincerely hope 4i gives me flawless service of of at least an year and a half and that I do not get to test out their after sale service. I missed out on the last sale of the Mi Band but plan on getting it in the next one. That would really augment this wonderful device very well.
1|5|awasm camera and screen and processor. look awasm but in my phone there is some heating problem it become heavy hot some time at the top section, heavy hot .problem or not dont know . plz tell me
0|5|Bought it on first sale made on 30th April, received it on 3rd May. (Delivery good) Using it since week now with dual sim (3g on 1st Sim & 2g on second sim) Over all looks - 10 / 10 (light weight, handy) Over all speed - 9 / 10 (octa processor rocks, 2GB ram is required to be 3GB) Over all functions - 9 / 10 (Need additional sensors like infrared, lollipop rocks) Over all audio - 5 / 10 (Not at all satisfying audio) Over all battery life - 8 / 10 (with avg use & dual sim with wifi battery lasts for a day) Over all Camera - 9 / 10 both front & rear camera is good - front camera is really good Over all Diaplay - 5 / 10 Though it says gorilla corning 3 glass i had scratches on day 1 Over all user experience - 9 / 10 - good package in the price tag. Over all ratings - 8 / 10 (I am music lover and this rating is due to poor sound quality & non scratch proof glass)
1|5|good smart phone & felt like iphone use. suggests that accessories like headphone, smart filp cover etc, should have been provided during launch. also atleast now can be provided at online stores immdtly.
1|5|Good mobile under 15k, initially seeing others reviews about heating issue I was worried, but took a changes of buying it with finger crossed There is no heating issue after installing bug fix software. 5 out of 5
0|5|Yes it is a great phone. There was some issues with my cell and I asked them to change or return it but after taking the guidance of flipkart person I was able to solve my issue. Main problem is that there is no suitable flip cover of it other things are great...
0|3|overall phone is really good but there is overheating problem . even the loudspeaker is really low on sound and currently there are no accessories available for phone
0|5|superb phone ..best in class for the price..initially had heating problems, after update provided by MI, heating issue is solved. pros: nice full HD screen good speed ,no lags MIUI6 IS AWESOME Camera is good quailty , low light its ok. call quality is excellent.. phone is light weight , built quailty is excellent. charging in 3 hours, single charge lasts for a day. cons justed needed a memory card slot , but Otg support is there that solves it.. i recommend this phone who wants buys ..
0|3|1. super budget samart phone 2. heating problem 3. no expandable memory 4. battery okay 5. camera features good.. super selfie camera 6. good slim 7. internet speed oky 8. valuable for money
0|4|Hi guys! I have been using the Mi 4i for about 5 days now. A phone should never be judged on its specs but the end-user-experience. The first thing you will be mesmerised at when you hold the phone is the perfect and strong build.The phone is extremely sleek and fashionable. The display quality is top notch.Full HD pics and videos look great.The OGS corning concore is resistant to scratches from daily usage. I was really happy with the MIUI. Lots of customisations.Not a lot of bloatware. The performance of the phone is great.There are two modes to work with.One is the performance mode and the other is balanced mode.There are no noticeable lags in each mode...... however for heavy use such as benchmarks or demanding games the Performance mode is better.Ram management on the phone is better than the redmi 2 or redmi note 4g. I have had no problems with 3g connectivity. And call quality is good on both ends. The battery life on the phone is pretty impressive(Note:When the phone was released Xiaomi said that the phone has 3120mAh battery ..... however the product box mentions it as about 3000 mAh.) Xiaomi has done good work in the camera department. Both the front and back cameras are excellent and there are decent customisations in the camera software. Finally i would like to talk about a minor heating issue in the phone. I would say that if you are a heavy gamer.... do not go for this phone. The heating is not much.In heavy browsing or using the camera the phone warms up just a little.Again .... this is not at all abnormal. However the phone becomes a little hotter when using maybe GPS navigation. Almost all new phones tend to get a little warm with the power they pack inside. Yes,I would recommend this phone to my friends.
0|5|I found it better than what the price tag suggests. Only thing lacking for me is the music quality of the phone. But perfection can only be desired, can never be achieved.
1|5|I gifted this to my wife. Initially I was really disappointed to see many issues like lagging, heating, camera, slow process etc. After few changes in the settings, all were resolved. Heating also became less now. I feel the camera quality is little low compare to my mi3. But, I strongly believe XIAOMI will never disappoint its customers. Future updates, will solve each issues and make this jem to shine more... Thank you XIAOMI...
0|1|Mi-4i battery doesn't even lasts for 6 hours that to in standby!!! On the very first day i charged to 100% and after using it for just 1 hour of data, and 20 mins of call, the battery was only 21%!!!! 2 hours after the battery just died. I seriously doubt whether mi has placed a 3120 mAh battery inside this. I have been using Redmi note 3G for more than 3 months now and compared to that its worthless when it comes to battery!!!
1|1|A fully charged phone discharges rapid and goes to 0% charge in few hours time. This happens even when the phone is not used. The phone also overheats Requested for a replacement
0|5|Thanks to Filpkart for prompt delivery. Awesome phone in affordable price. Feel like Apple I phone, Bought it in first flag sale on 30th April 2015.
0|4|I bought this phone on first flash sale, used this for a week. I like all their advertised features, selected this phone after reading so much reviews about multiple phones in the same price band. It works good except heating problem. I played Candy Crush for about 20 mins and the phone got heated up, so couldn't decided whether to continue using the phone after that. It happened on when performance core got activated. In normal mode, it works better.
0|5|nice device...fully smart and custamizable.. it is very sexy n beautiful device... power backup is also nice n my frnds also happy n register mi4i..
1|4|I purchased this phone as a gift for my father. Though I received it on 2nd May, we gifted it only today because of the occasion. Setup: Setup took longer than expected. I thought there was some confusion with Google account setup when it repeated the step again once done. That said, everything else was fine. Heat: Phone got warmer during normal usage at the top. But I guess that's with almost every smartphone nowadays. I didn't feel it much later on, may be because it subsided or I got used to it :) Primary Camera: Didn't not play around much. From what I have seen, pic quality is quite decent but even a slight unsteady hand can make your pics blurred. Performance: Seemed fine, though I could notice a lag while trying to change screens/apps swiftly. Overall, it seemed like a decent buy for its price. But, need to see how it fares in the long run.
0|3|Heats up a lot and Battery is so poor as compare to redmi note 4. it goes to 50% only with 10-15 minutes camera use Low battery could be due to its high resolution display (441ppi) and Camera. Everything else is awesome and it is a real flagship killer, the build quality is awesome
0|5|First of all this phone is real competitor for the phones of this Range........If ur going to Buy.......go for it with second thought...one more thing is that u have to update MIUI immediately after uboxing to prevent Heatings Issues and for good UI experience.... and the path is settings->about phone->system updates Pros: Build Quality is Excellent Light weight No Heating Issues!!!!(Mild heat as it is common with smart phones...) HD screen Camera Awesome FRONT AND Rear MI cloud with free 5gb storage Cons: Memory is nearly 11GB
0|5|hi...after using for a week,i am writing this review.... 1. Battery Backup excellent 2.Design is best 3. Display very gud 4. Camera in day light is awesome 5. Performance is nice.
0|5|I have used Samsung Galaxy, Moto G, One Plus One before. As being enthusiastic about Custom ROMS and customization freak, no device remain in stock condition with me for more than hour. Mi 4i has been outstanding so far. Updated to latest 6.5.3.0 and have not observed any excessive heating. I am not a avid gamer, but watched couple of 1080p on it and its screen is wow.Camera good. However, I can say nothing beats Color OS camera on One Plus One. As you get what you pay, no complaints....Awesome deal at 13k.
0|5|This is my first mobile from Xiaomi. Previously I used Samsung Galaxy S5 for 10 months. First I was surprised with the build quality with outstanding looks and also got attracted to it's sleeky design. Initially phone gets heated up but it overcomes by updating with latest MIUI. Stunning Display, Good Battery Back up, Some lag found while using facebook. I think it did a great job under 13k while compared with flagship devices. One word, "It is far better than my previous Samsung Galaxy S5 mobile". Don't hesitate to buy... Go for it.
0|3|4i has really low sound output.. I surely miss my calls in case the phone is placed on my bed or sofa... Xiomi should send some kind of update to overcome this.. but not sure if it is possible... But it has great display and I am really impressed with the colors.... good camera.. sometimes phone heats up while talking longtime or playing graphic intensive games..
1|5|Pros : 1. Full HD display (1080p) 2. Smooth touch 3. Good performance(Multitasking, Gaming) 4. Very good camera (both front & rear) 5. Good battery life for a featured phone like this (almost 18-20hr of moderate usage with gaming, mobile-data, sync on continuously) 6. Great UI (MIUI6) 7. Looks .......and many more.. Cons : 1. No app drawer 2. No microSD slot 3. Non-removable battery (though I don't consider it as a drawback) 4. Slippery back (it can be fixed with a back cover) Overall, this phone is worth every penny.
0|1|After 7th day, my mobile fell from my pocket unfortunately . The screen is broken and touch is not working Mobile is not good quality which they shown in flag ship video which mean they saying it the tested the product. I have used many android mobile but this Mi 4i is complete crap phone even a small drop this mobile will not handle. Please don't buy it. It not a good quality. Get's heated, not good hardware, Cheap bad quality screen (Not gorilla) very bad flag ship product from Xiaomi. Service center in chennai heactic always 40 people are present so this mean every one mobile have some defect. we are buying it in flash sale without understanding the real issue in mobile. Before buying it please visit Mi service center in your locality and U will find people coming to service center are more. As per the heading it clear that - Product is good in hardware design and speed. Screen quality. But it has issue in heating while charging mostly all the time after 3 days of usage can't able make call as there is complete heat present so making call will burn our ears mostly. Its not good. While using 2g more time mobile not get heated but in 3g it get heated within 20 mins of usage only in facebook none other apps. Few apps get crashed while opening not sure will there be any bug fixes from MI. Over all HEATING issue which will be make you think before buying this. As myself thinked same way and now have this mi 4i in my hand. its very slipery in hand need a hard case to hold it.apart this is ok. Screen is wow. smooth moving between apps no lag. keeping mobile ideal not much battery drained only little . ?Hardly mobile gave 12 hours in 2g with few games and 2 hours call. if 3g is on then Heat is on. Mobile took 3hours to 100% charge from 4%. Multiple apps running background also made the mobile get heated. I hope my review will be helpful.
1|5|I have been using this mobile since 3 days and I am satisfied.. Experience: FIRST and SECOND Day : Got warm on first boot. Infact whole day it was getting warm while playing high end games and 3g browsing. THIRD DAY: NO HEATING ISSUE, NOT EVEN WHILE CHARGING AND PLAYING high end games.......But it is advisable not to use it heavily while charging. Ratings: looks : 9/10 camera 10/10 (front is extraordinary , rear is also good) . battery 7/10 (expected more from this 3000+mAh). performance 9/10.. if looks,camera and battery are your priority u can buy this one without any hesitation... P.S: please do not over react on heating issue , specially on the first day (Every high end mobile gets warm) display 10/10 (sunlight display is tooooo good)..
0|5|Its a superb well built phone with brilliant display.The display will give iphone a run for its money.I didnt find any heating issue while charging or while handling(maybe depends handset to handset) Overall a brilliant phone for its price range. Only negative I can think of is small software lags which I hope will be fixed and 16 gb non expandable memory.Other than that its an absolute beauty
0|3|I had high expectations on this device and it pretty much lived up to it but but but, one major drawback is the overheating processor that heats up the phone inconveniently hot even with minimal usage.
0|5|just go for it if you don't want to brag about your phone brand in front of your friends :) Overall package is Value for money.
0|5|One of the best device ever had. The camera quality is just simply superb, none, i mean none of phone camera can beat its quality. Rich color of the screen is just mesmerizing. Battery backup is just superb. The drawbacks i found is heating issue and missing extendable memory option which can be compromised with this price range and quality of the product.
0|5|Pros: 1. Super Spec 2. Best Price 3. Camera and sound nice Cons: 1.No SD Card Option 2.default screen protector covers the front camera and proximitiy sensor so , making us difficult to have call dropping and front came function faills. As screens guards n market takes time to come need to adjust a lot with this.
1|5|The Mi 4i is the first Xiaomi phone to be launched with Android 5.0 Lollipop. But thanks to the MIUI 6 skin atop the phone, you can barely tell the difference between the look of the Mi 4i from the Mi 4 or even Redmi 2. The overall look of the MIUI 6 hasn’t changed drastically from the MIUI 5, but Xiaomi has refined the app design, made apps more simpler and flatter in appearance. For instance, the music and video apps are neatly divided into local and cloud sections; the clock app has a new design which is again divided into alarm, stopwatch, timer and clock; weather app has beautiful data visualisation; the Security app is neatly divided into different sections such as cleaner, data usage, blocklist and so on. There is a nice toggle button to switch a setting on or off. However, there are times when I noticed that loading the camera app or clicking on a folder full of apps took a second longer to open. The lock screen has a shortcut – swiping from right to left – to directly launch the camera app. At times a quick swipe from the right showed me the home screen for a fraction of a second, before the camera app opened. I doubt that it is designed to work that way, and hopefully Xiaomi will release an update soon to fix this bug.
0|5|pro: - Battery. - resolution quality. - beautiful interface. - 2gb ram is more than enough with this processor. - awesome camera quality. - no such heating issue. cons: - memory cards are not supported but you can extend the memory using OTG. - Sound output is very low from the speakers. overall, excellent mobile at this range. Appearance both of the hardware & software is superb,
1|1|Phone hangs very often. Application latency is very high. Tired of waiting for application to open.RAM is always overloaded. On first boot RAM load was around 1.5GB. Internal SD card spec is 16GB already 5.5 GB is consumed by UI.
0|3|Dont get fooled by the specification. The performance of the phone is not good at all. 1. The phone gets heated up even after playing games like 2048. During charging the temperature becomes quite high 2. There is lag in the interface. Even whatsapp is not as fluent as you hope it would be. 3. Google apps like dialer cannot be installed easily. 4. The body is very slippery. Quite uncomfortable to hold in one hand.
0|4|first of all its a xiaomi device with android L 5.0.2 and miui 6. this ui is one of the best ui. great low to mid range phone. build quality is good. display is the biggest plus point for this device. but i am not so happy with sound quality of this phone. and obviously there is heating issue with snapdragon 615. camera is good. overall in this price range it is the best phone to buy.
0|5|Pros: -Built quality is good and lightweight. -Screen resolution is great. -Battery life is just great. Lasts a day even with moderate to heavy usage. -Camera is good compared to other devices in this price range. -Snapdragon 615 is a good processor.Heats just a little bit while dealing with heavy gaming. Cons: -No expandable storage.
0|4|Excellent display, Camera and Battery. In some review heating issue mentioned but I'm using from two day it did not get heated in normal/daily use.
1|5|Its a decent phone in such low price. It gives you a premium feel when you touch. Touchscreen is awesome, you can say its more than a feature touch. Camera shutter is very fast, it clicks in less than a sec. No lags while playing high end games. Battery runs for 1.5 days. Every phone has a heating issue, even the Iphone. I have used Samsung, Micromax knight. These phones got heated more than Mi4i. But after the update I was not expecting heating issue will fix but it did. Speaker is in backside of phone so if you keep your phone in desk or sofa you will hear very low volume. I have installed a lot of application and it never lagged. High end games like Mortal Kombat, Modern combat 2, Real Steel champain, Asphalt 8, BIA 3, Future fight and lots of other applications runs very smoothly. If someone is disappointed after such performance in such price then there is no word for me to say :P After the update I ran AnTuTu Benchmark and my score is 39261 before it was 34k. Cons: No headphone, People are complaining that they didnt get headset. Whats the use of a crappy headset that you get with Moto G? Buy your own! For this price, lack of headset is nothing for me.
0|5|Phone is too good.No heating on normal uses including internet regular use of 1-2hr. sound quality is not so much but normally we use headphones.Camera is good both rear & front.Display is awesome with sensitive touch.
0|4|Well overall the phone is very good and handy. Works elegantly in performance mode. Camera quality is not awesome but yeah quite good at this price and last but not the least being an Ex-Nokia user m a bit disappointed with the sound quality.
1|2|The heating issue is real, especially during call receiving and you can feel on your ears. Battery drains out fast, battery saver mode not very efficient Volume and speaker is very ordinary, phone has lag issue. Overall not recommended for power-users. Screen is good but other things are a let down.
1|1|Pls do not buy this shitt.. its total waste of money Save your money its not worth for 4000 rs also .. Lots of Heating issue found during rebooting & surfing internet The device Heats for games like subway surfer and candy crush Battery also drops a lot even after disabling unwanted apps with reduced brightness Performance also Lags while switching between different apps it some time gets rebooted automatically Its a best Heating device made by Xiaomi. The call quality is nice display quality is clear camera quality is also nice again while taking snaps it heats up a lot.. so over all It is a rubbish device which xiaomi has manufactured.. i have requested flipkart for refund of my money xiaomi should not make false quotes .. first test your device then introduce it to the market .. 18 months of research for this shit is total waste if you make such device
0|3|hi had bought this phone from flipkart the phone is good but the disadvantage is in built 16 Gb memory no expandable (No Memory slot ) it is inbuilt...
0|4|I have used the phone for a day now. There is undoubtedly a heating issue in the device, but not as much people are saying. It does get a bit warm after an heavy usage. I would request Hugo Barra and his staff to give an update to fix the heating issue. Other than the heating issue, I did not feel any kind of problem in this phone. Display- Display is really good. As said by Xiaomi the ppi of this device is greater than that of Iphone 6. Build Quality- Decent for a 13k phone. Performance - No as such heavy lag is experienced by me till now. Camera - Nice, but would have improved. Storage - People who are okay with 11 Gigabytes of storage : This is the best phone. Other wise one can anyday access more files with an OTG cable. Till now, I am not coming across any decent back covers. I would request to launch some funky covers and cases for Mi 4i. Overall, I would rate this phone a 4 out of 5. PS: I am not a new Xiaomi user. I have used a Redmi Note 4G before.
0|5|first of all i want to say.. the only thing people complain about this phone is heating issue.. yes it heats, but only after excess use of camera or gaming. other than that it is a masterpiece and truly a flagship device.. pros: *best display *awesome camera (very good front cam) *battery life of this phone will make you awe *the phone looks more premium than its price *no lags while gaming *MIUI is really good *very slim (130 grams) *full HD video recording *very smooth touch cons: *no ear phones in package *and yeah.. heating a bit for those user's who are in dilema to buy this phone or not after seeing the comment's on heating.. *dont miss this awesome phone bcoz of its heating.. it dosent even heat that much as others are saying*
1|5|The front cam age feature caught a lot of attention, After using 3 hours of wifi as soon as i put this phone in my pocket i feel some heat. But after that in the evening till Tuesday night didn't observe any heat, While charging the phone on Tuesday night got a call (with wifi on) where i feel the heat on my ears for some time but its not alarming (Delhi is hot in summers) the quality and loudness of the call is something i felt for the 1st time.. OTA updates (806 Mb) did fix some bugs on this device. MiUI themes are rocking, Played Clash of Clans, Subway Surfers, Temple Run 1, 2. all run smoothly (without heat).
0|5|First of all Display of the phone is outstanding. battery backup is good interface is smooth. while many people complaining about the heating issue ,for my concern i didn't felt any such issue in spite of continuous using WiFi connection,Multitasking etc.. No heating issue on booting and initial setup. Sound is not as good as expected its feeble where its does lacks. you have to use headphone to get crystal clear sound. Camera is excellent regardless of being 5 inch display it looks small n sleek. For this price range You shouldn't bother buying it..
0|5|12999 everything comes with a cost attach to it , the best buy is when u pay n get the worth of it and MI4I is a great buy pros looks- too gud screen resolution- superb battery-gud ram enough opening few games and above normal uses audio-descent memory- thats lil issue but getting a honda civic for maruti prize is good- those who expects BMW in Alto price please get a life con heats little but not to the extremes
0|4|Dont believe in rumours... my Mi 4i doesnt heat much... and the battery camera and display are superb... as told earlier..user memory is 12.9 GB with preloaded APPS. free ram is around 850 MB which is little surprising, little low. everything is fine.
0|4|I`ve used so many android phones but so far this is the best one I could find.. The more I`m using it the more I`m loving it... ya there is lil bit issue of heating while charging but that no an big issue rest everyting is amazing at this price segment, amazing camers, processor etc... but one thing I must say if company ppl read this that company should provide atleat a screen guard since its a new model & no screen guard is available in the market...no ear phone even in the box...but thx for providing such an amazing phone at this price...
0|5|Pros: -- BEST DESIGN. It is an Eye-Candy as it is very sleek and light weighted. -- Has an amazing display and touch. -- Back Camera is suberb when u have some light around u.. Front Camera is far better than other phones in this price range. -- MIUI is easy to use and has many unique features like clean up and scan. -- Battery is average.. Lasts for more than 24 hours on standard usage. Cons: -- Speaker output is very low. Not audible in crowded place. It is the worst part. -- Heats up a bit when u do a phone call while it is on charge. Not much of an issue. -- Lags while using multiple apps. Altogether, I am satisfied with the phone and would recommend you to buy it..!!!
0|5|Got my phone, and to my amaze its awesome looking. My take after a couple of days usage Pro's 1) Superb looks 2) Super fast performance, no delay's or hang's 3) battery lasts more than a day 4) Awesome themes and decent customization options 5) Thin form factor, it almost feels like iPhone in the palm (MIUI also something similar to iPhone) 6) Good resolution Cons 1) Only 10GB available for use 2) On multiprocessing of too many things, you can feel it getting hot at back, but its ok you don't do it often 3) Glossy /smooth finish - slips from hand often
0|5|This is my first XIAOMI Phone.i am very happy with the performance and battery backup. camera and display is very good. when we put into charging ,phone is slightly heating.that is the only drawback of the phone.overall it is good phone.
0|4|Very good phone. Feel is good. Just heating issue but that can be ignored. Overall very good phone in this price range.
0|5|Excellent Performance,This much of good Camera Result in this price is too good part of it,Performance vise its tremendous. Must buy this piece.
0|5|Best buy at this price! Awesome Camera.Awesome Look and feel. Weighs very light. Go ahead and buy it! Great service by flipkart!
1|5|worth the money. Heating only while charging, that OK and is not a negative factor. Performance is good.
1|4|Phone is light in weight, screen was good , speed is good , looking was average. but price should be 10k or 11 k. should include little loud speaker. flip kart service was great.
0|5|Great Product...Extremely Smooth !! First alfalfa .. Thanks to my good luck that I was successfully able to purchase Mi 4i on flipkart first flash sale. Second thanks to Flipkart which delivered it to me in 3-4 days in good packing. Now coming to the mobile . I would like to mention following below points: Pros: 1. Very Good product at a good price Rs12,999/- . 2. Good Battery. 3. Very Smooth and active response. 4. MIUI 6 Ver 6.5.3.0 is Awesome. 5. Light Weight. 6. Both front & Back Cameras are fast and good. Cons: 1. Not able to expand memory, (No SD Card Slot).
0|1|I have got this device 2 days ago. and i faced charging issue. like while device is powered off and plugged into charging it stucks at 40% for hours and does not continue charging and charging light switched off. I tried switch on device and then plugged it into charging again it stuck at 67%. this is a major issue which MI ha to resolved to maintain its quality...
0|5|Gud phone . ! gud battery backup gud camera not a boom sound speakers .! but good one over all , a good phone at this price :)) the standard delivery was at May 7th and i got the phone 2day (i.e May 4th ) . So good Delivery and Packaging :) Overall 4.7*
0|4|First of all thanks to Flipkart for delivering it within two days. Coming to Mi4i review, it was just amazing, stunning display, Camera was good enough, design was so awesome. performance was okay. overall mi4i is worth for 13k :)
1|1|I was using flipkart from 2011, in happy case everything is fine, but when there is a issue with any purchase then the actual color of flipkart comes into picture. I ordered MI4i Grey colour device under diwali discount sale and received product on 16th Nov, I just turned it on... Touch screen not working. Unable to power off or set-up the phone. I called flipkart for return and replacement of product, They first told as i bought in discounted sale it is not possible to replace the product then later they told stock is not there and not possible to replace. My questions are 1. If you are providing 30 days replacement warranty to the buyers why didn't you keep some devices to handle returns and replacements. Instead you sold all devices without keeping in mind that you need to provide replacement of device if any issues with the sold devices. 2. So this is intentional act " 30 days replacement" is just a gimmick as you never keep some back up to handle replacements. 3. But I saw in filpkart MI4I available with different colour, I asked them that I am OK if they replace different colour to me, but they denied. Will this happen in any retail shop in India? under warranty if exact colour device is not there any retail shop will provide different colour product with the same price. i have got HP printer and Gigabyte mother board replaced with upgraded products under warranty when the same model is not there. So what does this mean .... flipkart ? what is your replacement warranty exactly ? 4. when he denied to replace different colour MI4I, I got a doubt that he is selling Refurbished or defective products in discount sale like Diwali. Or else what's the point in not to replace with different colour phone of same type. In diwali the Phone price is 9999 now it is 12999 . So I am sure that he sold refurbished product under diwali sale that's why he is denying to replace with same MI4i. Flipkart, give proper information to customers when running discount sales like you wont replace the product if customer buy in discounted sale.......
1|1|Dear Sir, I have follow-up with you from last 15 days, you have not resolved my problem. You are waiting for expiry time of 30 return period. You have automatically rejected my return request without solving my problem. I am not new user for you I have brought 5 phone from you for last 2 years. I request to you please replace my phone immediately. Regards, J.S.Mehta
1|1|Dear Sachin Bansal, Binny Bansal & So Called Customer Care (?) FlipKart Team, Order ID : OD104182073032105001 Order ID : OD404376776005558001 Product : Mi4i This is not at all customer centric approach. I have already explained the entire situation over & over to all of your executives and floor managers. And Moreover I want to tell you this is the SECOND time the same thing happening with me. First of all, why do you provide exchange offers if you are not able to fulfill it. If it was the courier constraints, then that wasn’t my problem and also I have told you repeatedly that the order was not cancelled from my end. If its cancelled due to courier constraints then it’s definitely and completely your fault for which I had to suffer for. And now on top of that you are saying I won’t get the same deal for which I had spent time and put the order. Also as suggested by you, I again placed the order on 4th November, and this time I just got 1 call from the Courier guy whom I had specifically told to deliver the same to me on Monday (16th November) and again the order got cancelled. If I have paid my entire money before the product’s delivery then with whose permission is the order getting cancelled?????????? I am really not at all satisfied by the way you are handling the your customers. I am also listing down the inconveniences caused to me because of you services. 1) First of all we wait for the Big Billion day Sale, so that I could utilize the benefits. 2) It was a gift for my wife which I was not able to make it. 3) The date given for delivery for 02 Nov 2015 that is a weekday and so it was supposed to get delivered on my office address. 4) I got a call from courier guy on Saturday, in which I feel the person himself was not intending to give me my courier. Even after telling him to contact me back on Monday he again made a call on Sunday, where literally the courier executive was forcing us to cancel the order. But same I said earlier, I did not tell him to cancel whereas asked him to deliver the same on Monday. It’s my strong belief that the guy wasn’t willing to give me the product, I don’t know the reason. I want you to please listen to the recordings of the courier person done to me. I hope you keep a track of that. 5) Also, as the offer was available only on SBI ATM cards, I had borrowed the same from one of my distant relatives and after the order was placed I also paid him the money in cash, which now I don’t know how to ask him back. 6) I also ordered a Mobile case cover for MI4, which I have already received. I don’t know what use it is now, I also want to return the cover. 7) Now after all of this, I again placed the order and am seriously very much dissatisfied in the way our orders are being handled. 8) And also, why every time my MI4 order is only being cancelled. With whose permissions are these orders being cancelled?????? If I have paid complete money for my product before its delivery, then without my permission how this products gets cancelled. Also I am worried as how come all orders gets cancelled at 11PM at night and not during the day time. 9) I have several others items in my list which also I wasn’t able to take as I was out of town for Diwali vacations, then why these items did not get cancelled and only MI4 gets cancelled. I don’t find all this user friendly. I would like to tell you, all the things or the solutions your executives are giving on the call are not that easy from a customer point of view. I also had some emotions attached to the gift. I don’t know whether flipkart is really concerned about its customer. Also, please stop answering the queries in 24 hours clock system, as your customer care takes almost 23 hours to reply and that also is not of the customer benefit.
0|1|This product I booked and over 5 days still no update in delivery. Its reached to my nearest hub 2 days ago but still it is not out for delivery.Product is good good but not good to buy through flipkart.it's really disppointed by flipkart.
1|1|Flipkart customer executive don't have rights to do anything. But ekart courier company having the rights to cancel the order. Customer raising the case but customer care don't care about it.
1|2|From day one I am facing the heating issue. It heats excessively, you'll feel like that your ear is on fire. It's design, UI and battery all are good but it heats sooo much that you can iron your shirt. I have contacted flipkart customer support for the return of product, but they tested the battery and said that phone is fine. Dear Mr Sachin Bansal, the phone heats excessively and I don't want a heater in my pocket all the time, I live in Mumbai not Ladakh. Mr Bansal please take back the phone and return my money so that I can purchase a better phone. Kindly do the needful.
0|1|IT is gud phone but only in papers. so dont buy it. I ordered it in sale, till date not received. so cancelling the order
1|1|I have purchased mi4i from flipkart in last month. I am facing many issues regularly. Issues are different with time. Every time I have to do switch off the phone and once factory reset done suggested by flipkart. Hence Please avoid to purchase this model. Flipkart also not supporting customers. Hence think before purchase mi4i.
0|1|i have placed order for mi 4i a week back and still it is showing that the product has not been packed yet
0|1|My got dead piece. A phone with no signal. When I registered the return request a guy called and whether I had injected some other form factor sim than micro. Am I dumb? How can we insert a big sim to that tray. Then asked whether I have already tried more than sim cards of different service provider. Unfortunately for him I have already tried that. Then he asked me to factory reset and try again(HE WAS ASKING ME TO FACTORY RESET A SET WHICH CAME TO ME FROM FACTORY. WILL FLIPKART CHANGE SETTINGS WHILE IN TRANSIT?). Still I agreed to do that. But instead of waiting for me to do it while on call or get confirmation from my side HE just rejected by return request. What should I do now? What ****ing service is this? This is what we can expect from flipkart. I think its time we go back to humans to buy things. They are dependable. The after sale service is guaranteed, right?
1|5|Too good phone in 9000 INR having much better features than Others. Also, good services and policies are being served by Flipcart.
0|1|FRIENDS I ORDERED MI4I MOBILE ON 18 June, 2015 AND ONCE I STARTED USING THE MOBILE IT WAS GETTING HEATED UP TOO MUCH SO THAT I M UNABLE TO KEEP THE PHONE OVER MY EAR AND SPEAK, IMMEDIATELY CALLED FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE AND ASKED FOR REPLACEMENT. THEY REFUSED AS THEY SAID ITS NORMAL FOR A SMART PHONE TO GET HEATED UP UP TO 40 DEGREE. AS IT WAS NOT GETTING SOLVED I STRUGGLED WITH FLIP KART AND MANAGED TO RETURN THE PHONE ON 4 TH AUGUST, BUT TILL NOW I HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE RETURN / REFUND FOR PAST 3 MONTHS. SO FRIENDS BEWARE OF FLIPKART SERVICE AND DON'T GET CHEATED BY THEM
0|1|Looking and performance wise ok.But the problem is mobile is heating higly every time. when u speak 10 minutes and when u play any game or simply u put charging also it is heating. after updates also it was not rectified.
0|1|Dont trust flipkart on their 30 days return policy. they will do everything for not return their product. the screen is fluctuating on 3rd day, when i format my cell it continue fluctuating. and after some time it work fine again after 1 day it screen started fluctuating. when i initiated return from flipkart they told that phone is currently working fine. so no problem with phone
0|1|HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE FROM LAST 2 TIMES. PLEASE FOR GOD SAKE READ EACH AND EVERY LINE BEFORE PLACING ORDER ONLINE OR YOU WILL LAND IN TROUBLE. CONTACTS DISAPPEAR...DEVICE HEATS ON RESTORE...NO MEMORY CARD OPTION.!! very unsatisfactory.
0|1|Tried reaching service center situated at malad for 2 days, they don't pick up the phone. Finally got in touch with Vashi service center. They said they dont keep spare parts and it will take 15-20 days for repair. This is ridiculous and not expected from product like MI
0|4|GOOD DEAL.....GOOD PRODUCT...PURCHASE WITH OUT FEAR...... I am very happy to received the product in wright time.received product with out any damage.working with out any problem till now
0|1|I bought the product on June 2015 got it replaced due to speaker problem. The replaced one now has a display problem. The display stopped working suddenly. Nothing can be done with the phone now. I now need to search for a service centre. If you are free and have lot time you can buy such phones and go behind service centres. I suggest users strongly not to buy the product. I have been a Fan of MI products but with the present experience learnt it the hard way.
1|1|As usual flip-kart delivery was on dot.Received on the 2nd of of ordering.. the phone look styling and less weight.display was wow! camera was good.... but all these sucks..The phone gets heated drastically even when u speak for 2 to 3 mins. believe that u will get a conscious that the phone going the bust in the ear.. pls dont go for this....i will be happy if i get my money back..........! this a small slim and sleekly micro oven.................i will be happy if flipkart give me option to change other phones...
1|2|I have purchased this mobile on june12, looks wise its nice and impressed..too. coming to functioning 2nd i found Blue tooth connectivity issue, requested flipkart they have taken replacement request and delivered the new device. next i found speaker issue raised concern to flipkart they told me to go service center to get approval but i fought with them i can not go its not my responsibility finally after long fight with different executives they have taken replacement of device. i got new device with in 4days of request, but fortunately again i got the same speaker issue. requested customer officer and they did smart check app found issue and took the retun request. finally i wasted 40days of my valuable time. and need to call every time executives which embarrassing us.
0|1|My experience wih Flipkart has downgraded a lot with my LAST (I mean it) shopping done on Flipkart for a mobile phone. Flipkart has pathetic return policy and worst customer service. Order ID - OD203370763893462300 I placed the order few days back and it was delivered on 17-Jul. I started using the phone on 18-Jul and realized that the phone is overheating within 5 mins of normal usage, getting hanged ans sometimes not able to place the call. I called up your helpdesk on 19-Jul to get the return / refund initiated and I was told that the mobile phones can be returned / refunded and a technician would be checking it remotely. (Well, your return policy nowhere mentions about all this. You need to update it asap & stop fooling the customers). I was told that I will get a call at 4.30 pm on 20-Jul. I told the person that I wont be able to take any call till 5 pm and he can get it recheduled accordngly. His reply meant 'I dont care'. On 20-Jul, I got the call and I managed to pick it up but your technician on the other side was speaking to somebody else. I was yelling 'Hello, Hello' but he disconnected the phone. Pathetic bahaviour again. I got a SMS that I would get a call at 1.30 pm on 21-Jul. On 21-Jul, I got the call. The person introduced himself (as he was calling from Australia) and asked him abt the problem. When I explained the problem, he put himself on mute and then in few seconds, he unmuted and said 'Thanks. Bye'. This was very strange, pathetic and irritating. I got a SMS that I would get a call at 10.30 am on 22-Jul. I wrote an email to your customer care that I wont be able to pick up the call at this time on 22-Jul and his response was that your issue will be resolved by 10.30 am on 22-Jul. This is the worst piece of customer service I have seen. First of all, you are selling faulty products and on return requests, you are fooling the customers and irritating them. This is my LAST shopping experience with you. They say 'To grow any business, you need to retain your old customers' But FLiokart has become so proud of their popularity in India that they have stopped using the word 'Customer Service' and taken the attitude 'We dont care abt the customers' For my phone - As per the retun policy, Get the return processed, pick up the phone and refund the money.
0|1|I have purchased this phone from flipcart on 23 june 2015 got deliverd on 28 june 2015. But since day one mobile front camera is not working. even returne case register with flipcart .soclaimed by flipcart's buyer protection & 30 days returned policy it's all blunder & bluff. till today flipcart product specialist is trying to call but he don't have no to reache out to me. it's sincer request don't by any Mi phones from flipcart as this people making us fool by delivering faulty phones to match target. then when u call them they will simply gives appology mails which they don't have towards customer. after 30 days they deniy all request & you need to go service center. about service center no need to tell after 10 15 visit they will accept it's faulty mobile then aske for approval for replacement that another 30-45 days. all this just because of we fools put faith on frudus online shopping site called flipcart.
0|1|THE PHONE KEEPS ON HANGING WHEN RECEIVING THE CALLS. LOTS OF PROBLEM IN THE SOFTWARE. NOT WORTH EVEN TRYING. NO RETURNS, NO CUSTOMER HELP, THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING US FOOL.....
0|1|it is hell disappointing to say that, phones like MI4i are very negligent about their quality checks. 2 major issues: 1) its phones screen touch became numb and screentouch was not functioning at all unless restarted. 2) its front camera started showing a lot of noise and gradually screen became full blurr... i also have a screenshot of it Im very disappointed with this kind of product and i need an effective resolution or else it is gonna go on review on socal site facebook. sorry !
0|1|Beware of this Product. You'll end up wasting you money. It's a cheap chinese shit in a beautiful wrapper. No unboxing reviews can tell you the bugs and issues with the hardware and software as well. I am using this product for last 20 days. And am now fed up with all the issues. To name a few - 1. Heating issues even after two upgrades. 2. After second upgrade the battery drains within 12 hrs even if you just keep the phone on table, with all the application, wifi, internet off. 3. Proximity Sensor has a lot of issues. 4. Touch becomes unresponsible sometimes. 5. The extra features which the phone offers will cause only trouble to you. Like, when I disabled a feature to not dial accidently in pocket, it started behaving weird. Camera clicks several pics inside pocket. 6. You cannot set a pin for more than 4 digits. So no exchange server synching which asks for more than 4 digits password. It will keep asking for 6 digit pin but will not allow you to put more than 4 digits. And the list has so many other issues. Apart from this FLIPKART is very very very reluctant to get me a replacement. I keep on opening requests and they keep on telling me to reset the phone and close the ticket. And when I called them, at first they tried to convince me then they put me on Hold for ever. After that they stopped picking up my call. Worst service by flipkart, for even Worse Phone. So, if you purchase this phone you will end up banging your head to wall after spending 13k. BTW This phone can be used as frying pan to prepare omelet. But trust me you can get a cheaper and better frying pan on flipkart itself.
0|1|Its worst experience in my life that I bought this mobile from Flipkart. Once you buy any product from Flipkart, there is no option to return or exchange it. You have to be satisfy with product which is provided by Flipkart. Guys please don't buy any electronic product from Flipkart. I am not talking about product but Flipkart's return policy.
0|1|No customer care after sell, not believing? just call MI customer care and try to log a fake complain!!
0|1|I received a defective piece by flipkart. On placing order for return I experienced the worst ever customer service provided by any e commerce website. 1st time i raised the order for return than without resolving the issue they automatically dissolved the complain saying the issue is resolved. On next day again I raised the complain to get it exchanged which was followed by a call from flipkart and they mentioned some troubleshooting steps to be taken. But without confirming if the product was working fine or not they again resolved the issue. This is just example of growing arrogance of flipkart customer care and are not at all considered about customer satisfaction. Very shameful on part of flipkart.

0|1|I purchased a Mi4i and its rear camera was blurred and Flipkart is not replacing the phone. I called its customer care more than 10 times and i wasted my 7-10 days for replacing but they are not attending me. I request you, not to buy any item from flipkart because its return policy is irritating me now and i am very disappointed. They are least bothered for the customers problem.
0|1|i bought mi4i from flipkart. it is a good phone. but i suggest all the potential buyers don't buy any thing form flipkart. flipkart has very worst return policy. Really very bad really bad
0|1|Few days back i purchased Mi 4i from flipkart, after 2 days of using i faced software issue, i requested for new piece , they arraned a call with expert, once they called me, bcz of their network error call got disconnected, again i requested for a call with experts, they said expert will call you tomrrow evening, but i didn't get any call , insted of expert call i got a message from flipkart like "we apologise for not being able to get in touch with you, we will call you back by June 1st. Still how many days i have to wait for a call, do you people think i dont have any other work.
0|1|I got a defective piece which has an issue with mobile data connectivity. The mobile data works for only few minutes and then it will not work. I need to either restart the device or turn on or turn off the device so that the mobile data work for next few minuites. Also heating issue is present. Hoping for flipkart to replace this piece at the earliest.
0|1|Battery drains very fast, It doesn’t look like 3000 mAH battery. Phone temperature rises to 45 degree.It’s hanging & heating too much. Heating is unbearable on front & backside of phone, heat is generated near camera & earpiece. Phone is lagging in normal application, Ringtone & Alarm volume is very low. I’ve also done bench marking, Results Found on phone are different than written on MI.COM website. antutu : 27984 instead of 40253 quadrant : 18148 instead of 25686 cf bench : 27442 instead of 57216 And its really Crazy and Ironical that after a purchasing a new phone, you have install a 800 MB update (With your Own Money) to resolve the problems made by the manufacturer.and even these updates are not reliable, Then other two updates comes (more 50+40 MB) for rectification of the errors done by developer of the phone. Even that does not work. When you install XIOMI PC Suit it is entirely in Chinese language, that much conman sense is expected from mi that it must be released in english. Requested for return: 1. First return request: the customer care person told to backup and reset the phone and cancelled the request.But it didn't work and problem persisted. 2. Second request return : the customer care told to install smartcheck app and did some testing and told that my phone is working, and rejected the request. Again I have requested for the return. Lets see....
0|1|Product Mi4i. Received a defective piece. Menu LED at bottom left not working. I raised the issue with customer care . They said a call shall be made by the technical team . Unfortunately , no call has been made and it has been two days since Flipkart is dragging the issue. On enquiring with customer care it was said that the system generated call could not be connected and an SMS and mail was sent intimating the same. I was ready before time for the call. I did not receive any call or mail or SMS. There are other people on their page reporting similar issues as well w.r.t. processing of refund. So either there is a serious problem ?their systems or they are simply harassing the customers by wasting their time with lies.
0|1|This is a most pathetic phone I have ever seen. Calls get dropped after half a minute. gets heat up even if I'm not talking. Speakers are very bad. I am not able to hear even the ring tone. FM is also not working. Its camera doesn't work inside my house. PLEASE return my money back.
0|1|very bad service of flipkart for this product, i have tried for the replacement but the "engineers" are not approving.
0|1|If u open only one app like whatsapp or fb and if u get a call ur phone will start burning like hell with in 2 min .. if you ask for flip kart for replacement u will ask to get ur handset serviced ..if yours is new mobile y you want it to be service ? i have used lot of mobile but got to say this mobile is only hype and flipkart is worst online shooping mart as if you go for replacement or return they will give you only one standard copy paste answer...So if your planning to buy this mobile and no issue of using a mobile which gets heated so much (you can google search you will find lot of reviews of mobile heating ) then only go for this mobile else its just a hype dont go there are lot of good mobile and online shopping portals...
1|1|Dear friends i bought this mobile on first flash sale and this mobile started heating like anything ,please think twice before buying this mobile ,MI is cheating the customers by selling this cheap mobile with high SAR value as u know higher the SAR value causes Cancer even i faced lot of problems with in two weeks of time and requested flipkart for replacement and after fighting for 9 days flipkart replaced the mobile thanks to flipkart but after replacement also am facing the same problem with this mobile You cannot speak more than 10 min in this mobile . So please those who have less usage of phone can buy, but for more usage this phone is not advisable so please think before buying and about the SAR value of this mobile you will not find any details in the internet and at the back side of mobile it is mentioned that 1.6 but as per rules value must be below 1,6 .
0|1|The phone getting very hot if I talk 5 minutes only.The battery temperature gone to 44. Flipkart also not considering the user problems for replacing the item.I am facing the worst customer service from flipkart also.My advice is don't buy any mobile from flipkart.
0|1|Guys , Bought this Heater during may 14 flash sale . Handset touch response is totally poor , Heating issues. flipkart is sending defective phones . If u ask for a replacement - no response from the customer service and no actions taken till now. Do no Buy from flipkart . Dont waste your hard earned money . 30 day replacement guarantee , flipkart guarantee is a fake. This phone deserves 0 rating and flipkart deserves negative rating .
0|1|my second worst experience with Flipkart. The Mobile I call Mi4 i. Gets heated to fast that it hurts while holding as well as on ears. Can Imagine the Degree of heat not less than 48.... Flipkart and the product company smartly pays for the good Review but restrict the genuine critics and bad reviews to avoid their sales effect ...... No solution provided until now. Incident: 150516-039344]
0|1|This is the third time i am facing this problem which is, after confirmation and payment being done, they have totally cancelled the order without even consulting the buyer. And the process of booking Mi4i is again you know!!!! so what in the name serving customer flipkart is harassing the customer. When contacted the customer care, they say that nothing can be done, I have to again go through the long process of registering and waiting to get book which i have already done twice... So is this the way to treat a customer FLIPKART????? PS. i have faced the same problem in two other orders earlier!
1|1|Surprised that Phone supporting 4G is not supporting 3G network Video calling. I use it extensively to talk to my parents for direct Video call over 3G. Raised the return request. No Video Calling Over 3G and they say they support 3G? That's clearly a wrong description. As per policy They must take back the phone. Also audio quality is so so. Speaker Volume is low too, while playing video speaker volume is almost low, as not audible.
0|1|Dear All, I have bought this mobile in first flash sales and I was thinking I am lucky to get the mobile, but after a weeks use I realize it was my worst choice. Within a week Back button, Home buttons have stopped working and to add to my misery when I contacted Mi Customer Care the person talked to me for some time and cut the call without finishing it. I never expected such a bad service from Mi.
1|1|I made request of defected phone on 7th of may-15 and today its 19th of may-15 and flipkart is saying please wait for some time we will replace your phone as i have purchased new phone from market and now i don,t need replacement i need my money back else i will take legal action against you.
0|1|This review is not about Mi4i ( which NO Doubt is a wonderful phone) but it is about the Seller/Retailer/Supplier of Mi4i. Dear Flipkart...During the flash sales the customer is actually Wasting a LOT of his time in booking the phone.. i have booked Mi4i twice now. Even after the successful payment of Rs.12999/- i receive an email on the 5th day of the booking, stating that my order has been cancelled due to unavailability of the courier service to deliver at my address. The Customer Care Executives were of NO HELP!!! They could not tell the actual reason of the cancellation of my order. All they could say was that the courier service company does not deliver at the given PinCode.( 248001, 249199) NOTE: 248001 is the state capital of Uttarakhand !!! Actually..Flipkart ( WS Retail) has earlier delivered a number of my orders at these PinCodes [ Lenovo A6000, Redmi 1S etc].. but all of a sudden they choose to cancel my Order without giving me an option to change the delivery address. All this incident has been a BITTER experience for me and if such a thing continues, FLIPKART's reputation would not last long.
0|1|I received Mi 4i on 3rd may five days before the promised date Initial impression was very good but after using the phone for some time I was unable to use it because of the heat problem After the phone gets heat up performance drops drastically antuntu test result was shocking it got 21k far below the promised 40k+ very disappointed with the product and after sales service of the flipkart
0|5|I am a big geek and a tech follower. I have been using mi 3 as my primary device and I am fully satisfied with it. I bought this device and I just want to quickly sum up all the pros and cons and how the device has evolved since it was launched. Pros: The design is just stunning and it never feels like a 13k phone. The display is just gorgeous. The phone fits perfectly and has a pretty sturdy grip. The back camera is pretty decent. The underdog here is the front camera. The front camera is simply magnificent and has correct exposure levels and is very less noisy compared to other devices. MIUI 6 runs well on lollipop and has a greater RAM optimisation compared to other Xiaomi devices. Cons: The only problem I feel is the storage option with available memory of around 10 GB. As many reviewed, the phone really was laggy and had heating issues. Xiaomi has to be given credit here because they have managed to improve device's performance by providing regular updates. After many OTAs the heating has been resolved and there are no lags whatsoever. The device can now runs hardcore apps and games with ease and without heating. Sure it doesn't perform as good as a snapdragon 800 but there is nothing more to ask for at such a minimal price. The sound was not loud at first but evolved over time. Currently, its pretty loud. Verdict: This is a great device and a sure sure winner. It a good deal specially when compared to other phones out there. The display is worth crying for and the software support from Xiaomi's side is great.
0|4|I received it on 2 May 2015. Looking sleek & light. Os is simple & colorful. Perfect size to handle. I will come back with full review in couple of days.
1|1|This Phone have So Many Problems - HANGING PROBLEM, CHEAP HARDWARE Install ,ON/OFF PROBLEM ,Games Not Working Properly and Too Many . I have receieved this Product after using this product 2nd Day the Problem Starts specially Hanging Problem .Please I want to Return My Phone as Soon as Possible and Refund My Money .
1|1|1 thing which is biggest issue , phone is getting heat up to much even not in duration of call. It get hot that much of level i can't carry in my pocket also. i have to take it out. with this Problem you can't even touch the screen on cheek to make a call. rear Camera is good but front camera quality is not impressive as pixels are getting faded when zoom on image. After installing Above 500MB game, phone stop working and shutdown automatically and then boot-up. No Headphone comes with phone box and Flipkart confirmed that MI is not giving headphone / earpiece with phone. We have to buy separately which causes extra money need to pay at outside. Now looking from flipkart side to return my phone. I dont want it.
1|4|Hi Guys, I received this device yesterday, and I was very disappointed with the performance. Device is getting heated up so quickly while making calls and playing low end games such as Candy Crush for 10 mins. This device is not for worth 13K
0|1|I got the product today. But after update phone has heating issue. its like hot cake!! Am thinking to return it. But other aspects is very good.
0|4|+ points: 1. Light in weight. 2.Battery life is good. 3.Full HD, 1920 x 1080 Pixels is perfect. 4.Camera clarity is awesome and magic focus option is awesome. 5.Fast delivery flipkart made good impression. 6.Phone size is handy. 7.Good performance. 8.GPS more accurate. - points 1.Heating issues. 2.White color back panel made cheap plastic look. 3.Speakers located on back panel is not good. 4.After market service totally failure. 5.No accessories available with phone except charger. Conclusion: worth to buy - design and quality is good.
0|1|1) Phone gets heated up iron box, this phone can be used for ironing your clothes not for calls. 2) Current is getting passed from the round metallic plate which surrounds the camera when I keep the mobile for charging. 3) Back camera is the worst part, not even equal to 5MP. 4) I have tried plugging in to different switch port but then current gets passed from metallic plate of camera its very bad. 5) Totally its a worst mobile, Flipkart I just want my money back, no replacement. Very poor response from flip kart customer care
1|1|Recently, I brought Mi4i Mobile phone, while using this phone, I came across no. of lacunae like low user memory, heating while charging the battery / playing / accessing any applications / pgms, no earphones, no memory slots etc. I am a govt. servant and finding very difficult to use this phone with no. of lacunae. I wish to return the phone & want my money refunded back to me.
1|2|i got this mobile today. mobile features are great at this price but one major problem i see is that this mobile gets heated very quickly if charging or using apps for a longer time. heating problem is big issue for me. I will explore this mobile for next few days and provide review again.
1|1|I regret buying this phone. This phone has over heating problem despite multiple firmware upgrades. Battery life is hopeless does not last a day. Now it not charging. Servicing center is asking for paid repair despite the phone being on warranty. Phone is with the service center for past 10 days expecting for the parts to arrive. I would suggest please invest wisely and do not go by the specs. Only good thing I liked about the phone is the display.
0|1|used for just 5 min and its temp bump to 42 degree and phone hangs so much that can't even make calls
0|4|good one. i find the phone working fine. thank you flipkart for quick delivery................................................................................................
0|5|i am writing his review after 4 months of usage... i must say i am very much impressed by this Chinese beauty..the battery is amazing its last a full 24 hours , and that too on heavy usage except games.. speaking of which i have seen some idiots about the phone getting hot after some time of gaming.. guys mobiles are not meant for gaming,its like using a rat instead of a horse ... the temperatures remains fine if you us this mobile as a mobile and not a freaking gaming device the built quality of this device is top notch.. i have had a few careless bumbs on hard concrete.. the sides have been scratched but no issues wish the mobile.. the best part of this mobile is its display.. really awesom with great colour reproduction ..even in bright sunlight .. the only probleam to be frank i faced with This hand set was..the audio out put is really bad ... bad as in a freaking 4 k phone has a better out put.. you really cant here the rring tone if you are in an crowed area,,, and friends there is no solution for this either Common Xiome you really can do better than this... so in a nut sheell if you are OK with the low audio, and if your not an idiot who uses his mobile for hardcore gaming then u should go ahead for this chinese Marvel
1|2|It is an ordinary phone with ordinary features and i haven't found anything extraordinary as people have been talking/ reviewing at various websites. Battery lasts within 12 - 13 hours even at normal usage (without playing games). Camera picture quality is just ok and can't be compared with what a Samsung/ Apple produces. Despite of a 02 GB RAM applications take time and internet speed goes slow in this phone. I put the same 3G sim in other phones and internet speed is so fabulous but this phone makes internet connection go slow though i keep updating software. i would rate this phone as 02 at a scale of 5 with the kind of 13k price we pay and the kind of quality Xiomi Mi 4i produces. Go for Brands like Samsung, Motorola, Panasonic - They have better quality products within the same price range and brand feel is good.
1|1|This phone is not good. And I felt it would work very well. But, it doesn't reach my expectation. Whenever I use skype video call it will hangout just after a minute. Battery life is also not good.
1|1|we can use as a substitute of a body warmer in winter season. I don't want to recommend such type of stupid device. It may be damaged your ear. So friend be aware of such type of device.
1|1|features are too good ... but you wont be able to use it as the phone heats up .. cannot even continue on a call for more than a minute ... redmi 2 is a better option cheap and best
0|3|All Feature are good & excellent Quality Used for overall Handset. Following Disappointing Factors are 1. Camera is Not of Good Quality & not much Options for enhanced Features (Sony/Samsung is marketing gimmick) 2. HDR On provides not very good Pics & Hence Not much to say 3. Could have provided expandable Memory for such cost & Profiled Phone. 4. Heating is also The issue when using video & games which effects the camera performance.
0|1|So after mi3 i thought of upgrading to mi4i. Well i was disappointed after a few days of usage for the following reasons! 1.It lags a lot no matter what mode its on it will lag and you will hate it. 2.It Hang a lot and apps like facebook crash constantly and its irritating. 3.Overall the product quality is not upto the mark there is small space at the bottom of the screen from where you can see the light coming the insides of the handset ! 4.Plastic is cheap. 5.No support for regional laguages !
1|2|Even after all the updates, it still is the shittiest phone I've ever purchased. Shittiest phone ever. Ever since it's purchase had to format the phone 5 times. Sometimes you will not be able to access the settings, if you try to it just hangs the phone till it overheats. Cannot change Wifi networks/settings, it hangs the phone. Everyday, twice or thrice it manages to create 10 Gb of trash, no idea from where it generates so much. Once the trash fills up my phone memory, it's just a dummy phone till you go and delete all the trash manually. The only app that I use are: Whatsapp, flipkart, PayTM and HDFC mobile app. Still it can't handle the load. I hope I can return this piece. Will give it 2 stars for it's camera.
0|1|xiomi's all phn battery backup is not good nd even customr service is also so bad,workers are very irresponsible nd always trying to make money by different sources..i request you not to buy xiomi's phones otherwise you will be responsible for your problems.
0|1|I have following problems and Flipkart is denied to provide new piece: 1. Sharp valume button in the edges. Children may get hurt. 2. 3G and 4G is very slow and loosing connection intermittently. (I tried to change SIM card two times, as I thought it may be SIM card issue. But later learned that, same SIM card is working perfectly in other mobiles). 3. Since 3G is very slow, TrueCaller and Cisco Webex applications are not working. 4. WhatsApp application sending videos in corrupted format. Others cannot see video correctly(not sure, if its a Mi issue or WhatsApp issue or camera issue). Thumps down
0|2|The Phone is not good All Cons no Pros Too much Heating no External Memory not a Flagship phone looks are good but performance is the worst
0|1|One of the worst mobile phone ever i have seen in my life. Please do not spent money on this product. Heating Issue from first day of purchase.
0|1|I bought it from Flipkart (flash sale). This phone makes tall claims but delivers very poorly. I played candy crush on it for 10 mins and the temperature shot up to 77 degrees!! At one point I thought it will burn. MIUI is horribly slow when switching between apps. Complete disappointment. Please keep away from it.
0|1|I have bought MI 4i from flipkart, the mobile was not as per expectations and 30 days replacement warranty of WS retail is also fake they refused my request the mobile was costed for Rs 12999 and it does not have external memory slot and internal memory is only 16 GB . I am feeling cheated , some one please suggest me some ways to resolve this.Even they did not provide any screen guard with the mobile which they used to provide with other MI Mobiles.This is totally useless product any one can go with other mobiles like ASUS Zenfone 2 which have same features and expandable memory upto 64 GB.
0|5|I expected good quality,and got something much better. the 13 MP camera on the phone is something to appreciate,as 13MP digital cameras,dont perform as much as this,and i personally loved the Magic Focus,and HDR recording for full HD recording. Performance-this is one factor it didnt compromise,the 1.7GHz octa-core packs a punch,no wonder Benchmarkings cross high standards.(However,through prolonged usage the area around the back-camera-where the processor is located,will heat up,but its nothing compared to other similar devices i hv used. Phone offers lot more features than other phones of same price-only drawback is Mem card cant be used.(16GB internal is quite enough.)Cleaning and security apps comes with the phone (powered by CM),and phone is highly customisable-you could play around with the customisation for days!.and this is the best part of the phone i would say. Exterior and casing is of good standard quality. speaker playback-requires more bass-effect(speaker playback is loud but comparitvely Sony phones audio playback has more clarity and effect.) Full HD screen!-and that sets it apart from other phones of the same class. Overall-This phone could be actually sold for 18,000+and it could still compete with its rivals,13,000 is quite a buy indeed.
0|5|Excellent , Mind blowing , Superb phone with many features pre installed in it with - + Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS
1|1|major problem with the mobile 1.heats up a lot and gets hanged and doesnt even respond 2.very low sound 3.UI CRASHING 4.after opening camera heat will be more 5.moderate battery backup 6.tends to heatup even at charging 7.its a 2gb ram and showing only 500mb free all the times please dont even think of buying this mobile im suffering a lot after using it
0|5|Specs wise the phone is really nice. Using the phone for past one month. 1. Battery seems fine even in dual sim active, but phone is slight laggy always. 2. Good Camera, but low light pictures are worse, once you copy to computer you can see completely blurred and grains. 2. No accessories other than charger inside the box (Not even screen guard). 3. Automatically rejecting/muting the incoming calls at times, so you will not get the notification of that call. Every-time, you have to check the call register to check if there is any missed calls. It will be written "Rejected", even-though you dint do it. 4. Once you connect to WiFi, may things will be downloaded even if you turn off automatic updates and downloads. It will be written in Chinese language, so you wont understand it. 5. All your history, logs, activities are passing to MI, which is not at all good without the permission. 6. My phone got restarted several times, even at times charging. 7. Good display, touch is not the perfect and having many flaws. (play "Tap the frog" or any similar games, then you will understand the touch sensitivy n responses), but normal using you will not get the touch prob in notice. 8. Writing whatsapp msgs is very slow compared to other low range phone. 9. The major issue is, the phone at times start apps, or take menu options, if we touch it with headphones wire once it is connected. So touch never requires just our fingers, so if we keep the phone in pocket, be sure that "Pocket mode" is active, or it will start functioning when it comes in contact with our leg, even though its in pocket. 10. And finally, (dont think as last prob, there are many more..), This is "Frying Pan", no matter you use internet or wifi or anything. Once you make a call, within 3-4 mins the head piece will make you stop the call.. Ya, it will help you to reduce the phone bill, :-P But not at all healthy device. So, I really suggest you all not to take this phone having a great wish in mind for the High specs and Full HD display, like I did... Better go for good brands, who having proper service center and a company who gonna treat their customers as King. See, once your phone is faulty (Chinese phones like MI, and all other phones you buying in pre-booking dhamaka sale), WS Retail or flip kart (Flipkart is WS Retail. This website is just acting as their window to customers and to avoid the legal problems) is not going to give you a replacement. Please look the Honor 4x reviews (1 stars)... WS Retails(flipkart) is best seller in all items imported and indian, but in phones, they are just cleaning out our pocket in few second with the name of Pre-booking sale. Hope, this review will be displayed.. :) Just for that giving 5*****. Real Rating is 2/5. Since its not giving the primary use of phone "to make call and talk"
1|1|There are issues in MI4 i : 1 - Major Issue Heating 2 - OS Issue - "Error" - " unfortunately incallui has stopped" 3 - OS Issue - "Error" - "unfortunately android.process.acore has stopped" 4 - When make / received call and if the caller is put on speaker mode the other caller will not hear your voice. 3 times wipe out cache and wipe all is done but problem remains the same. I called up MI Service center in bangalore they suggested me to contact Flipkart for replacement I did but flipkart wanted me to first go to local service center bring job work sheet and then they will replace this 10 days old mobile. Service Pathetic , My recommendation Avoid MI4 i. I am MI fan but not happy with the product Seriously. Regards Anil Kumar Dogra
0|5|Flipkart delivery - ordered on friday. received on tuesday. However even after one week of order received, flipkart still showed product under transit. After e-mail received invoice. MI4i - First Xiamoi phone...China maal....NO REGRET....review after 18 days Everything is at par according to phone specification in Rs12999/-. Battery backup - last for more than 24 hrs (considering office goers, it may be less for college students).Charging very fast. Camera - Ulitmate photos in good lighting/day light. In low light visible noise. (AUTO settings). Front camera is also good. Beautify feature make it superb. However i feel too closeup photos are stretched in vertical and compressed in horizontal (not checked after installation of latest MIUI6.5.5.0 update). MIUI - Fantastic. UPDATE IT. IT WILL SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS. First update is approx. 900MB. Second update (6.5.5.0, MUST) specially for overheating issue. Display - once you own this phone, you forget any other branded phone in terms of display.Works very well in direct sunlight. Superb!!!! Calls - with call recorder facility!!! no need to install special app for it. Call quality v good. speaker is not upto the mark or its better to say POOR. Its better to put phone on vibrate mode. In noisy environment or watching TV you definitely miss your call. Video player - Good. with option of brightness adjustment. No option to play next video.You have to close it and select other file. Performance - By default i use it in balance mode. NO COMPLAINT. Works very well. On data transfer (approx. 1 GB) thru OTG cable to pen drive, phone hang completely. hope this issue will solve in next update. This issue need to be resolve due to limited internal memory.Only approx. 850 ~ 900MB RAM available for user but it is still works fantastic. Gaming - thanks to its 441 pixel density display. Asphalt 8 works fantastic. No as such impact on battery life. General - Good options to lock individual app lock (in privacy setting). Inbuilt app lock work only when you unlock phone. Once phone unlock and app open then it remains open till phone lock. guest mode is classic. Inbuilt applock - There should be option to lock wifi, bluetooth, mobile data, specialy SETTINGS itself like 'APPLOCK' app. Guest Mode - There should be option to choose app to open for guest. At present limited by default data hide. Most important OVERHEATING ISSUE - Without first update, Mi4i is another name of fry pan. Within short duration of call, specially camera use it heated suddenly. After first update, this issue resolved 50%. it means if battery charged more than 50-40%. you will not feel sudden heat on call/camera use. however, after it during call it start heating within couple of minutes. After second update, specially for this overheating issue, now NO ISSUE OF OVERHEATING...... Overall - 4 star phone (1 star less for Xiaomi's phone testing team for overheating issue, In India every smartphone user does not have wifi connection for such huge first update) with 1 extra star for its price = 5 star phone. This is just because at present no phone in the market with such specification under such price. In another way you have to spend another 400/- ~ 600/- (depend upon your wifi internet provider) for approx. 1.2GB update. approx. 300 for screen guard and back cover (must). Received message from Mi for free screen protector directly. Still waiting for it. I am also planning to buy another Xiaomi phone - Redmi2.
0|1|While the specs maybe great for this price, the hardware is appaling. The mi4i phone has a serious heating issue. The phone just heats up within 2-3 minutes of normal use. I am afraid of keeping the phone in my pant pockets fearing that the phone may explode if used for a considerable amount of time. Flipkart's call centres have been awful. They have rejected my return requests and aint helping me in resolving the issue through their smartcheck app. Avoid. Looks like just another Chinese phone.
0|1|First Impression is Good< Things go Bad when you start using> HEATING LIKE IRON FRONT CAMERA HAS A ISSUE PICTURES NOT BLUR IN ANY LIGHTS FILPKART PLRASE TAKE THIS PHONE BACK AND RETURN MY MONEY.
0|4|After a long waiting, reading lots of reviews, using the one which my friend got in first flash sale, finally i am able to get the one in 2nd flash sale. Feeling happy to see one day before delivery. Thanks FK. Before writing the reveiw, I wanted to tell you the phones I have used prior to this one. 1) Sony Xperia S 2) XOLO Q800 3) Redmi 1S 4) MotoG 5) Mi-3 Now coming to review part of Mi4: Pros: 1) Crispy display with more ppi. 2) Good finishing and sexy look 3) Clear sound 4) No lagging while playing heavy games like asphalt 8 5) I am able to download through play store in 4/5 mpbs, youtube videos in 7/8 mbps (basically it is based on your internet connection) 6) Battery backup (i am getting almost more than a day which i have not seen in others) Cons: 1) No headphone (please do something Mi. Really this is very boring to have a cell without cellphone) Till now I am using my lovely and pyara sony headphone. Coz i can not compromise on music quality. So please send a good Mi headphones. 2) Not expandable memory. Minimum should be 32gb till date. People are watching videos, listening music playing games. Please think of this point xioami. 3) Right side volume up key - Not liking to have that feeling while touching these buttons. Roughy touch sense. 4) Heating: But ok. As per the energy theory this is ok. Not hazardous. Hope this review will help a lot to new buyer. Signing off. Thanks Ganeswar
1|1|Phone is handy, compact looks good...but has heating problem while multitasking.. It gets heated near camera and sometimes become too hot. Its not support the encrypted mail of corporate mail but other branded andriod 5 device support it.
0|1|Mi 4i is generating lot of heat problem, camera is not working Every time it prompts could not connect camera, try to restart the device. It is really waste of time. Touch is very slow. I have redmi2 without any issue, but mi 4i is having lot of problems. Customer support is not good in handling user problems correctly. I raised a concern on date 9th and till date i fell very bad. Every day i call filpkart cusotmer care and ask the update, simply says our technical team is very busy they will contact you soon. please be patient. once the 30days is completed they say you have exceeded the policy and simly skip the cusomer issue.
0|2|Received the Mi4i yesterday. The cell tends to heat up quickly. Camera does not work. This partucularly heppened after the update from MI got installed on the cell.
1|1|if you compare mi 4i with i phone it's type joke.I try for return but not possible as per flipkart return policy.If any want contact me. 0 star
0|4|Xiaomi's "Mi 4i"- I was impressed with the specifications and price as soon as it got announced. I've been using it from last 3-4 days and satisfied with what I've paid for. Initially thought of opting for Zenfone 2 but finally made a choice to buy this. AND regarding the HEATING issue mentioned by many users (main reason why I thougtht of Zenfone initially), it's just the matter of that 800 MB update. After the update I never felt the heating issue. So before using the phone applying the latest update is highly recommended. Pros: 1. Latest specs and uncompetitive price 2. Display is ultimate 3. Camera is good enough - still have to explore more on this area 4. Fast browsing over Wi-Fi - I liked it personally. 5. Light weight - I liked this too 6. Ample themes available for display beautification if logged into Mi account 7. Call clarity is very good. Cons: 1. Look and feel of the mobile is not so graceful as expected. Especially back of the phone is just like something covered with white plastic case. Its predecessor "Mi 3" almost of same size had more attractive look with glossy back finish. Could've provided similar finishing for this too. PROBABLY also due to the White color back, so other colors which may be available in future may look better in this area. 2. Felt a bit LAG here and there - Not sure if Mi releases some patch for this. 3. Lack of expandable Memory slot - But as per the official MI statement, not having SD card slot is an acceptable reason- as it supports OTG 4. RAM - out of 2 GB. It always shows available RAM less than 1 GB even when no other apps were installed - so this can be an issue for hard usage? -- Personally disappointed here 5. Lack of accessories - alteast back cover and screen protector could've provided - if not free of cost atleast on paying few more bucks After all comparisons made, still Mi 4i scores better compared to the specifications and Price. Hope the review is useful. Giving 4 Stars - due to less RAM availability and that little lagging
0|4|The best that i liked the most about Mi 4i: 1. Its slim look : very easy to handle & use. 2. Amazing 13MP camera: I liked auto focusing feature the most. 3. Battery Backup: Can stay more than 24HRS as per average usage (2g net for 7-8HRS) 4. Remaining 2GB ram all bla bla bla things are advantage. Disadvatanges: 1. Heating issues but it can be tolerated as it happens with every android phones. 2. NO headset, NO screen guard , NO Back cover-->(Xiomi Saved a lot on accessories) Yaar If you are selling a Underwear why don't you sell a Trousers. I have to search in market for back cover/ Flip cover n still i am not getting it. Mr Flipkart.com pls be noted when you launch a new phone kindly arrange accessories like cover/screen-guard & all which are not readily available in market. Dear All Don't hesitate you can go for this phone its awesome.
0|4|got it in the second flash sale.delivered in 2 days.this is the better one in the price range.sound is perfectly ok. camera is also ok.battery back up is also nyc..
0|5|First the service given by the flipkart is great and the mobile is too good since from last 4 days I am using Mi4i there is no issue with Heating its happen only at updating the mobile at first about the camera good quality and over all 5 Star for this Mobile. Why they have not provided the Headset???????
0|2|The Specs are good but when comparing to Yureka .Mi 4i could have delivered more . 1. Battery backup is not good . 2. No expandable storage available . 3. Inbuilt battery so if battery is gone then phone becomes unusable . Overall good but not so powerful as it was said .
1|5|flipkart and MI shown our site processer is octa core max 1.7 GHz but part provide only octa core 1.6. I have 2 time replacement my phone but flipkart provide same part I advised plz do not buy this phone
0|1|I ordered the phone on the 1st day it was launched with great excitement. Only the first day of usage was good to experience. It heats up quickly even when watching videos. Automatically rebooted often, but now seems to have reduced. After every reboot the wall paper size/orientation changes, so need to resize or set the wallpaper newly. Any app crashes itself. Whatsapp could not recognize any of my phone contacts (After reinstalling a couple of times the issue resolved, but the issue randomly appeared today. So reinstalled whatsapp and again fixed the issue. Its hell worse) OS itself consumes 1.2 GB of RAM approx., but however doesnot hang when browsing, downloading or playing high-end graphic games. Abruptly the display goes blank (black), need to wait a few seconds to allow recover itself. Only good entities I found are the battery backup and the camera resolution. I would definitely suggest you NOT TO BUY this product.
1|2|Heating problem near the ear phone.Very low speaker volume. Very good camera, both front and back.Excellent touch and interface.Battery life hardly one day!
1|5|best phone in this range. superb display and easy to use, fit in hands. believe me heating reviews are fake. on first reboot i hv used it continuously 2 hrs but i hv not feel any heat. performance is very good. ISLIYE SOCHO MAT BAS KHARID LO. TOTALY WORTH OF MONEY.
0|2|this is bad news for Mi customers that mi 4i gets heated alot during charging and even heated during long telephonic conversation. so please dont buy this phone.
1|1|not worth buying. heats using only browser mobile data connectivity problem everything else is good but heating is a big issue mi should work on heating problem i bought redmi 1s last year it has less heating problem but less than this one (mi4i). not satisfied with the mi4i . want to return it not replace
0|3|Can Mi clear this???????? Any user who own this phone also ans me after check your device. And also 1 question: There is no color choice right now. Company selling only white phone. I dont like it. I wish color is blue.
0|2|What the hell the designed the back cover such a cheap plastic box??? it's noisy when vibrating mode, and side volume & power buttons are sharp edges and irritating while using it, and these buttons are not smooth functioning . And, again HEATER , it's heating heating always. All other features are not bad.
0|2|i have purchases mi4i , nice phone nice touch nice camera, nice processor, but ear plug is not in the box . is there anyone purchases this ph. than tell me about this
0|3|Very good phone but problem is that there is no excess slot for memory card .Sound quality good, no leging,picture quality is also good. that is 13 mega pixel
1|2|May 03, 2015 is when i received the phone I loved the form Factor .. the camera nice... was used for only 1/2 and hour when suddenly out of blue i thought why not use it with the dual microsim. after insertion of the sim I got blue screen of death. nothing worked ... charged it tried to use activate it with my lappy no use... My phone was a dead phone within less than 2 hours of usage..
0|5|Thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery.. Packaging was very good.. Now coming to the product.. It is truly a flagship phone from XIAOMI.. Dont believe in those heating hoaxes... Go for it...
0|5|MI4I is great in terms of specifications and great performance ..no lag no slowness display is awesome 441 ppi great. camera is nice and zooming quality also nice. battery backup is very good compare to another phone in this price segment and yes quick charging is very nice .yaa getting warm while using wifi or 3g internet and direct sunlight ..... if u compromise in heating issue ...this phone is great buy. go for it guys ... highly recommended :)
0|4|Works pretty well .highly customisable ui ,just in love with miui6,the only untold con is heating.I didn't experience any extreme heating ,but highly noticeable heating especially during charging ,I would have given 6 out of 5 if heating issue is resolved(if possible) via system update. Screen is very vibrant.thumbs up xiomi as of now.
0|3|Pros - Great Look Battery Strong Network Cons - Camera - 7/10 No Memory Card Slot battery Inbuilt
0|3|At this price display is awesome ....all people wrote a review that phone has a heating problem but i think all are wrong....only problem is that phone does not support GUJARATI LANGUAGE....so we can not see gujarati whatsapp msgs and any gujarati website on internet and also in facebook......
1|1|Power button and the volume button of the phone is of very low build quality. Dont know about other things , but battery also looks it is of 1500 mah Camera is Decent . and MIUI 6 is really complex. not very easy to understand for a standard user.
1|1|I could have given zero star but that option is not available.. Flipkart delivered product before time..and asked for return within two hours of use.. Cons- 1) Display is Full HD and looks good in shadow/in home but when I went out side to see in bright sunlight I observed grid of white colour shiny dots equally spaced over screen (approx 5mm distance between every white shiny spot). This is more clear visible when screen is off. Look very bad and shows the quality of product (Chinese) 2) Ringer volume is not clear and not audible in more crowd area. Definitely you will miss the calls.. 3) Speaker quality is not up to the mark. Its not loud and clear 4)Ferrari without seat to seat--I have uploaded around 20 (max 40 mb size)apps to see the performance of mobile before that I have updated mobile software (800 mb size) and found only 5 gb space available. I was surprise after seeing this.. 5) width of buttons bellow screen (Home back etc) is very less.There are chances to touch the screen since width is very less..I think it is not designed considering human finger size.. 6) Sharp edges on volume and power button. I have informed to flipkart for return of the product asap.... So guys please think 100 times before buying this Chinese phone...
0|3|Mi4i: Mobile with best hardware specifications below 15000 Moto G3: Mobile with medium hardware specs and Best softare reliabilty within 15000. 1. User Experience: Apart from all the talks about number/specification gimmicks, user satisfaction/in-hand experience is more important. Moto G3 is clear winner(9/10). Mi4i is good but cannot beat G3. 2. Battery: Even though Moto has less numbers(2470maH) is lasts as long as Mi4i. 3. Camera: Moto G3 is better in rear camera. But for selfie Mi4i is clear winner. So it is a tie. 4. Lags: Moto G3 will defeat Mi4i any day. Problem with Xiaomi device is that they do update MIUI but they never unpdate Android version. Please never buy a device which never updates Android and only update its own skin. Moto G3 is clear winner. 5. Sound: Both have good sound quality. But Moto G3 is better. 6. Durability: Moto G3 will be more durable due to its good build design and water resistance. All those who are buying the device between 10000 and 15000 please go for Moto G3. Now it may sound 2-3 K costly but in the long run it will save your money. You can use moto g3 for next 2 years without any glitch as it will receive all the android software updates. An android device without future software updates is like a dead wood.
0|1|MI4i is just a fake, nothing is standard, if u compare it with LG/motorola/nokia/samsung even micromax....its horrible. battery 3120 mAh... much worse than 1500mAh. 13mp camera !!! worse than 5mp of nokia. my xperia m is much faster than this 1.7Ghz. total waste of money.hangs from the first day !!!!! lumia 730 is much much better or moto g2 in this range. and flipkart !!!! after delivery they will do nothng for any kind of problem. they will ask for this and that, but never will take the responsibilities after delivery.
1|1|recently purchase this phone on 27th May, having multiple issues :- 1) Heating problem in upper and lower part. 2) Play Store not working, when you download around 10 MB apps shown downloading time around 2 hours. 3) It has re-starting problem. I request to refund this product, if not refunded by flipkart, i will never place any order from flipkart. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, [Note -Flipkart : refund my money back as i have already generate the request for the same.]
0|1|The Phone have following problem... 1. Camera image is very bad in low light (not even equal to 5 MP) 2.Excessive heating while charging & Net use 3. Very Low Volume of music & ringtone 4. Battery actual 3030 , where as Xoimi claim 3130 (unethical practise) 5. Processes are actual 1.6Ghz which shown on my screen. these are the information which I can see , we all can imagine what else they are hinding to just sell their phone to Indian people.. They are trying to make fool to indian consumer ... I am requesting to flipkart please return this phone ....and requesting other please dont but this chinesse box
1|1|Recd the phone three days ago, had issues with the firmware, fonts . The emails are not downloaded automatically though configured to sync every 10 minutes. Have to down load emails manually. The home screen many times does not even show new msgs. The same goes for Missed calls.The fonts options too limited.

0|3|My first mi mobile.amazing feeling to hold and use it.Beautiful display and good in multitasking.Only prob im facing is getting heated some times and looking for mi team to solve it by releasing quick updates..Best phone at this price.
0|4|I have used this product for around 3 months. In these month, I found these things in the phone: 1. It's very light and fits in hand very easily, the back have matte finish which looks great but makes it slippery a little bit. 2. It do have a very good quality camera, it takes very beautiful pictures which i like the most about it but you should have very still hands for taking the picture. Rear camera is very good as well as the front camera. 3. I'm not satisfied with the performance of this phone because after playing the game for 20-25 minutes it starts legging, not that much but it legs. 4. The phone starts heating after using it for 10 mins. It do not heat in normal condition but heats while using camera and playing games. Surely, every phone heats up but not around 45 C. I found that while using it for around 30 minutes, the temperature reaches about 45 C easily. And these things are after the update. 5. After the updates, the phone lost its performance in every field like gaming and camera. 6. The phone have a very good display due to which everybody likes my phone including me. 7. Battery lasts till the end of the day very easily( around 10-20% remaining in the evening) but need charging everyday. I would suggest this phone to those who are not very heavy user. Someone taking it for the camera and looks go for it, but for playing games it is not recommended.
0|4|do not use much phone, not getting heating issues , worth buy in big billion sale - 9999 - 1500 old phone - 10% on citi bank card - got it in 7.6 K
0|5|After using this phone and testing it rigorously I can say that this is amongst the best phone within this price range. Display, camera, sound everything is perfect. Smooth performance and classy touch. The phone was having heating issues in the beginning but now it has been resolved after a system update. Don't use phone while charging to prevent heating. Otherwise no problem. You can feel a bit of heating though. Just one cons: It do not have expandable memory. Flipkart's delivery is excellent. I would recommend this phone. Final words-fully satisfied.
0|4|Hello, I brought 2 number of this phone on day one of it went to sale (18 Jun 15) and it got delivered on 19 Jun 15 as promised. I am writing this review in Dec 15 so enough of time for hands on. Kudos to Flipkart logistics team for providing excellent service and keeping committment. about the phone. This was my first Android and I was hesitant but after going through specs though of giving a try for Xiaomi. i was not disappointed at all. Initially before using I update with the latest SW and it was all ready without a glich. Pro's Best features at reasonable price. very good camera with dual tone flash excellent touch response No lagging at all Quick charging lightweight good design sufficient RAM great GUI Good sound quality Good battery Sound output is quite loud and clear. Cons 16 GB non expandable memory :( heats up a little with heavy gaming or usage comes without headset, have to shell out extra money to buy and only available at Xiaomi site,. (all others selling mostly duplicates) Battery gets exhausted with 3G/4G usages. but last for whole day with moderate usage (gaming/ data/ calls) single speaker is at back so during watching movie on screen the volumes heard is lower than actual. My verdict at this price point best phone to buy.. Xiaomi rocks...
0|5|Mi4i is really a great phone esp. at this price range. I had a lot of time consuming research comparing various products before buying this phone. Though there so many choices available with rich features and attractive price tags, and thus it is very confusing to choose one. I had already heard of Xiomi's products so I did select the Mi4i from the big list. And I'll say it was not indeed a bad decision. Thanks to Flipkart for the sale price I could not refuse and despite of the festive sale traffic and a remote delivery location it was delivered in good time. About phone- Its more than a month I've been using it and no complaints yet. I had heard of heating issues in this set but not much I have experienced. GUI- A beautiful interface always attracts me let it be a PC, a website or a phone. And honestly the design and themes are just awesome. Specially the theme customization feature I feel it like having more control on how you want to see your phone. The icons and simple menus are attractive. Though it may seem a bit difficult to some guys to find everything on home screen and not a seperate app zone. But a good use of folders solves the issue and instead makes easier to organize and move through the apps. Screen and Display- Colors, contrast and resolution I'll rate them 5star. Size is good but I would have loved a larger screen for watching videos and movies. Brightness good even in sun. Performance- Let it be Gaming, apps or media processor and RAM feel enough for me, though I am not a hardcore gamer but still as an average user I am satisfied with it. Multitasking is good though it may sometimes lag and flicker for some themes. Camera- I am not an expert but still I am a photography enthusiast and I like to capture photographs whenever I see something beautiful. And this phone has got a really powerful camera which makes me a fan of it. The sharpness and colors are stunning and I am amazed to see some good action in dark where even some of Point and shoot cams fail. The manual settings allow a little more control and creativity I am not saying it stands to freedom provided by a camera but still you can't expect more from a 10K phone. Battery- Enough for a normal user. It usually lasts about 24 hrs, with wifi running all the time and on a tour when I had no wifi usage and limited internet use it lasted 2 and a half days. Sound- Clarity is fine on speaker though not something special. Headphones play it better. Call sound is nice. Cons: No headphones and memory not expandable, still 16 Gb feels enough if you are not into a lots of big apps, games or movies. Finally, I would recommend this piece to anyone who wants a decent looking, good performing phone in a packed budget. I don't think most of us need more resources in terms of memory or processing than in this phone. And really I won't suggest anyone to put 40-50k in a smartphone when one is available in 10-15ks.
0|3|I am posting this review after 6 months of buying it. It might not be that helpful to lot of people. A few initial days it gave me a hell lot of trouble with the heating and software problems. But after the update it was working like a charm. Then a few months were really good. But Xiaomi software updates after that were a real pain in the ass. Both while updating it and after that it gave lot of trouble. Like it crashed a lot. Hanged a lot. Plus some of the apps like messenger didn't work that smoothly. Overall I thought that it was the Xiaomi's shitty software that was making this really good phone look bad. Until my phone's screen got cracked. And I am not lying I didn't drop it nor did I accidently hit the screen. It was kept in my pant's pocket as always and when I took it out It had a huge crack. Rendering the touchscreen useless. Display was still working beautifully but touch was gone making the phone useless. To add to my misery. The phone had a tempered glass over it. If anyone's having the same problem I would say look it up in the internet A lot of people claimed of the same thing. That the phone cracked in the pocket. Mi4i Touch screen is different. The space between protection glass and the touchscreen is negligible that's if there is a crack over your screen touchscreen becomes useless. Unlike Asus's zenphone Z2 whose touch works even if the screen has a crack.
0|4|First and foremost, it is an awesome phone with just one problem, 16 GB internal memory. If can do with that, just go for it. Awesome phone...no lags..no heating problem...great UI.... Battery Camera(front n rear) UI SCREEN :} NO LAGS - No headphones - lack of accessories in market IMPORTANT POINT: Update your phone before using it, there is a update of 800mb. IT WILL SOLVE THE HEATING ISSUE ETC..... Was this review help

1|4|i am satisfied with this phone camera is more detailed rether then samsung phones , cons is no expandable memory ....
0|1|I liked the product in the first hour but after one day I am experiencing the worst part of it. The phone gets restart anytime while using, even I am not using it it gets restart automatically. I requested exchange and the technical person suggested to upgrade MiUi version to 7.0 something, I did that and also factory reset my handset, but the issue is still on, I have contacted once again to flipkart but still my issue is not solved and no one is looking at it, complete dissatisfaction from flipkart and Mi.
0|1|Using this handset from last 2 months, suddenly screen is not clearing coming lines on screen, half screen is totally blur.
0|4|This phone has a bad name for getting heating up.....and thats true. But overall the phone is value for money and just fantastic. I have been using it since last couple of months and only recently when you look into the contact list then it list starts shaking on screen....else did not find any problems with the phone
0|5|This phone is really amazing. superb finishing. features of phones are amazing. you can surely buy this phone. its value for money. low price and high features. must buy.

0|3|1. Phone Heating, 2. Service Center huge complain a product. 3. Price & Qualification for product is Superb.
0|5|No doubt about the product. The best product in its price range. Awesome display and body is very slim.
1|5|After using 1 year i can say this is obviously a budget phone...it can beat iphone 4s ..i am not comparing with iphn..battery gives one day full service after using internet and playing music...dispaly quality is 5 out of 5..miui7 is like ios..."your phone your customization" ...but there is a common problem in all mi handset is u cant use INTERNET (2G,3G,4G) properly..i mean the same time i am getting 50% extra speed in any samsung phone..mi4i failed to impress when i am turning on data and using net..working properly on wifi...i have redmi 1s, redmi 2,redmi 2 prime and mi4i...comparing to other mi handset mi4i doesnt heat easily...but the common ISSUE NET PROBLEM....
1|4|Handset is good and apps is easy to use but battery runs down faster and needs charging everyday. These is no expandable memory slot.
0|4|i will gave 8 rating out of 10 in this phone ram,processer,and all other things are excellent camera is good but there is a problem this phone don't have external memory and get heated early if it is not updated
1|4|The phone is working fine and is a good deal at 9999.Though there is some heating problem but not as much as many are facing! May be i got a good quality product!!!
0|5|very good product as compare to other brand quality very good and battery life good camera very good speed good very handy
0|5|I bought this phone during BBD for 9,999 - When I first opened & started using the phone, was really amazed seeing the build quality of phone. After using for >1 month here are my comments. Pros: Better features for the price Excellent display & 5" screen 2 gb Ram & 16 gb ROM - very fast 13MP back & 5 MP Front camera is superb Low light images with back camera is good. Selfies are of great quality to take. Low weight & handy Touch is excellent, smooth key pad loved it. Fast internet access. I don't play games much & no problem with heating for me. Cons: Back panel is very delicate, should have been better Only ~11 Gb is usable out of 16 gb ROM & no expandable memory - only feature I didn't like. Wanted ~32 Gb. No screen guard & Ear phones in the box. Some apps i.e, App lock & true caller doesn't work properly, which was fine with my previous SM. Overall I will recommend this phone for the buyers, awesome phone for this price range. Really loved it.
0|5|Best phone ever used. Awesome Phone. Touch, Display, camera and Battery backup are the few excellent features to highlight,
0|5|i got this Phone for my Mom on Diwali and She is extremely happy to use it .. as the phone is very sleek and good looking and she loves the camera quality both back and especially the selfie camera is awesome .. well i'm just writing this on behalf of her you can say .. Happy Buyer :) .. Thanks ..
0|1|what mi is selling not smart phones...smart iron boxes... i bought this phone....one month ago....it worked only two days....
0|3|The display is very good. Amazing battery life. Good camera. The main issue is with the performance. It lags quite frequently and heats up considerably also. The GPU is not fit for a 1080p screen and there is CPU throttling also. MIUI is also quite heavy on the RAM. Overall it is a mediocre product as the device feels sluggish.
0|4|Awesome phone , amazing features and build quality..camera is quite good with awesome flash. Recommended for every selfie addict like me. not lagging till now but have minimal heating issue while charging.
0|5|I have been using this phone for 5 months now and have not faced even a single issue till date. Battery life is amazing, it lasts for almost 2 days (1 full day if you play games). UI is superb and camera's picture quality is also pretty good. This phone is a must buy, I think its worth every penny u spent on it.
0|5|I have been using this handset for the the last 8 months and it's a very good device. Updates also keeps coming. Long life battery. Nice camera quality. Thank you for this model!!!
0|5|first I tell cons: 1) The Phone is heating while charging, if less network coverage and u continue using the internet. pros: 1) very good camera 2) Nice in-built software (no need to down load software like memory clearing, themes, anti-virus etc ) 3)display is very good 4) even they have software update frequently
1|5|Good Point : 1. Battery Backup 2-3 days Of Heavy Usage. 2. Cameras Unbleaveable 100 Out Of 100 (Both Back and Selfie) 3. Slim and Easy To handle 4. Dual 4G ( one at a time) 5. Display quality 100 Out Of 100 5. Sound ok. average. 6. sensor 10/10 7. Zero Lag 8. Play 720p HEVC Smooth 9. Benchmark 45000 Bad things: 1. No Memory card Slot 2. Heats Up Only On Multi tasking 3. sim canot be replaced Easily you have to carry the pin given by the Redmi
0|5|Its a great product perfect in its design ,size and weight. feels absolutely light to handle and phone is classy in its looks and the MIUI is great experience and camera produce nice colours in day light and its ok when night Overall great product to buy with good build quality especially the rear part, whatever the stain just can be cleaned with eraser :)
0|5|Camera is Mind blowing with Detailed Manual Setting Mode. Excellent Performance with Long Lasting Battery :D
0|1|ok but not as expected from review. Phone is slow and hangs also. Not recommended. Memory is not good.. Cost is ok
0|4|Satisfy with flipkart's fast delivery. The mi4i is a nice product but in spite of 3g n 1.7ghz processor it works very slow. Flipkart is trustworthy so guys without any hesitation just opt flipkart.
0|1|I bought it before 20days.Simply dont buy this phone. Dont beleive expert reviews.very worst speaker and worst earpiece sound.Even you cant hear ringing sound.Very poor user interface.I complaint to flipkart. But nothing happend. My hard earning money gone just like that.I request whom wants to buy this phone,please,please dont buy this.I cant give even one star.
0|5|Using this phone almost about a month now. Excellent features. Worth money investment. Camera quality is good during light or daytime but not upto the mark in low light.
0|4|i am totally satisfied with this mobile at this price using for last 6 months it might become slow if you put load on it but will work excellent. make sure you update system if any problems. i have become hug fan of Xiaomi you can even compare this phone with iphone 6 and 6 plus.guys i challenge iphone with my mi4i .its batteri life is good,JDI display is excellent as well as camera .Good product Mr. Jun Lei thanks for this product.i would certainly recommend to buy.
0|1|It is a very bad experience by purchasing Mi4i mobile. It is getting frequently hang. Have to restart. Not coming in silent mode after making it to vibrate mode.
0|4|Worth buying it. Superb camera light weight. Some heating problem at first but it was reduced by 50% after the os version updation. U can get Regular update from MI.. LOVE IT
0|4|It is really amazing phone. nice wok, good looking , new user interface, nice theme . the most attracting is camera. the battery life is not very well. :k
0|5|Its been 1 month that im using this phone. looking wise its great. Build quality is top most... very rich look... Very light weighted and sleek. jst 120 gms. But the back cover doesnt give a better grip.. You should use some back cover for better grip. Display is awsome. really a mindblowing FHD display. Software wise... MIUI is better with its features... Now MIUI 7 is awailable for this.. Memory- Provides no external memory.. and gives only 10 or 11 GB free memory after its OS usage. My suggestion: MI is Outstanding company in providing support.. software updations.. If you are going to use ur phone for many years.. then this would be a better option.. The combination of MIUI and Android will give you only best of the system.. Go for it...(I bought this one for 9999 on divali offer... feels lucky)
0|5|The quality of material, Good Camera clarity with a Perfect High-resolution Display make a good fun filled phone for a budget mobile buyers. Ya it has some heat issue not that much and some lags in opening apps. expect these it's totally good enough. for this price range we can't expect all as to be fine in it. Even if you buy a 72000 rupees iphone has some issues. for my moderate usage its good
0|2|I purchased it for my brother, but from the 2nd day only he started complaining for the heat n hang issue and calls related problem in it. I would suggest to go for moto G on around same budget.
0|5|Amazing...product and the seller's honesty and genuineness is defined by his products...loved it man
1|1|Heeating Issue, Phone is getting too much slow. Also get hanged. Keyboard is also sticky. Other Models of MI are good but i think this model is the factory defect model. Also check same models all have same issue.
0|4|Mobile is awesome but having big demerit is only 16 gb internal memory and not having expandable memory. Battery heating problem. touch sensor is too good.
0|5|I just became the fan of mi after i bought this phoneand bought many products from mi but all are great. Pros Display 10/10 perfomance 9.1/10 camera 8/10 battery 9.3/10 Cons. no memory card but its acceptable firstly it got heated but after miui 7 update the issue was totally solved dont go for negative reviewers they are just beginner and im the expert in phone devices and ya mi officially support rooting so liker other brand it will not void warranty iand enjoy root priveldge easily
0|1|I bought this phone in may 2015 . Ok it's a fine phone , but it has major issues with its charging. It takes a long time to charge even with the original charger. Once your battery goes dead you can't charge it again so you always have to be conscious to not let the battery dry out fully. Right now i am suffering because the my battery dried out and now my phone is dead , i cant charge it .My charger is fine it is working with other phones . I used a different charger but the phone wont turn on. I have used this phone for 7 months >
0|5|Mi4i heats a lot and particulary at top area near the ear piece and difficult to hold or put on your ear. Even after updating it to MIUI 7 didn't made any difference. I went upto MI Service center and they said 45 degree is normal for this phone. Difficult to hold even when hot. Rated as 5 to keep this post up and save others money. Poor Phone; bought it for Rs 8500(during Diwali). Waste of Money.
0|4|works very nice,,, camera quality is just awesome , battery backup is also quite good, the only problem with this mobile is external memory card,,, if it was there this would be the best mobile of this time fr its cost
1|2|Not so impressive touch . in spite of 2GB ram , phone lags . In 1 month , screen replaced . thanks flipkart for this. overall dpnt go for MI at o; .
0|5|This device is very good. I am loving it. one limitation I observed that there is no SD card slot. Otherwise this mobile is excellent in performance.
0|2|phone gets hot very soon, some time very hot during charging, and now its giving problem front camera stop working.
1|4|I bought this during the first day sale and I am very much satisfied with the product till time. There were some heating issues as pointed by many and is sorted out now with updates. Photo quality is good in day time and average in night snaps... Now they have released MIUI7 which is very much better in terms of heating issue ,battery and performance .....
0|5|Working perfectly for past several months. the performance and battery back up is decent looks nice and sophisticated.
0|5|A phone is master piece it self, the features are same as for 20k phone. incredible long lasting battery, crystal clear 441ppi fhd resolution screen, and most importantly its very light weighted. over all 9/10.
0|4|before having set in my hand i was worried about the quality of the product (being a chines company) but after looking on the product and usage i would say it is value for money. crystal clear screen view, good camera result and excellent battery backup with smooth performance. Only problem is set get a bit heat up with continuous usage and limitation of memory.
1|4|After using it for Three days: Phone is slim , body is nice ,picture quality is good. Ph is light, It gives a feeling of having a 13k ph in hand. over all this package is good except few points as below: 1)Storage: After three days i have only 1 gb left so there must be SD card slot. 2)Power button is not so good, it looks like if i will press it , it gonna be damage. feels artificial. 3)Back camera hardware fitment is not good , it must be placed properly. 4)Calling sensor is not so quite good, some time response some time too late. 5)Battery drained so fast, i use ph only for calling in day and i use whatsapp in night and other stuff on ipad, battery is not so good, hardly survive for 12 hours. 6) double tap waking sensor is also not up to mark need improvement. It response to late. over all anyone can buy this ph is having value for money. " ITNE ME KYA AB BACHE KI JAAN LOGE"
0|5|Please go for this product, After using MI note i bought this phone. It is really really light weighted. Display is awesome. Heating issue solved after done update of MIUI. Battery last terrifically long time. Value for money.
0|5|Amazing Product and if you are using this product , it will show you the quality of MI Xiaomi.. Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing
0|5|I purchased thus product for 8999 , and I can surely say its worth it . Wait for offers and buy this. This is the one you must go for . Better than lenovo vibe p1m. Can surely assure you quality. If you find this review helpful please hit that like button. TRY THIS PRODUCT AND I AM SURE I CAN GIFT A SMILE!!!!!
0|5|Great build, great performance, good camera and good screen quality. Xiaomi is the next generation maker of phones and makes top notch products
0|4|It's battery and camera are good. Also speed is according to it's specifications. But memory is only 10.2 gb ln place of 12.77 as specified in Company specs.
0|3|been using this phone for 5 month, played injustice for 4 months Pros: Specs are the pros, really good specs in the price Cons: 1> Performance degrades with time (may be common in all android phones). Injustice game started lagging. Now even some apps open up 2-3 secs late. 2> Battery backup reduced to less than a day with average use. 3> Some software bugs like issue in playing mp3 downloaded on phone.
0|1|This the worst product ever.The services of flipkart is great but the product-mi 4i is waste of money
0|5|I bought this on Big Billion day sale for 10000 bucks. This looks good and I am using it for a month now. Extremely happy with the prodcut. Great value for money.
0|4|It's an exceptionally high class phone. The battery life is extraordinary and look wise very beautiful. Xiaomi has again delivered a top quality phone at an attractive price point.But since I also use the Mi3 I feel that this phone is not as good as Mi3. Only the battery life is better.
0|5|the best thing about the device is front camera which is excellent for selfies, the the rear camera is good as usual. The battery lasts for more than a day, processor is super fast.The sleek look is excellent aesthetically.
1|5|Sleek , light weight, amazing battery back up, excellent Front & rear camera... only thing which really makes you feel little sad is it's heat up after continuous use..but one bad thing cant not over power rest BEST... I am in love with my phone..
0|5|Bought it on Diwali Sale for 10K, Kind of Good phone.. Looks, Light Weight, Awesome Camera Quality (Both Front n Rear) Smooth functioning .. for me its the best phone under this budget.
0|5|Using since 1 month(Nearly)...for this price u cant get a better phone than Mi4i. * Stunning display * Great battery * front cam is superb!!! (Rear is ok ok type) * Stunning looks (feels premium) * Lack of screen protection
0|5|It's an amazing phone. Battery is superb. Display superb. And camera also to good. Over all good value for money.
0|5|The phone is a rel delight to use, let it be the user interface or the design. The light weight and sleek design is awesome to carry. Technically the processor is flawless and so is the battery backups , Strongly recommend for the 1st timer Mi users.
0|5|HEIGHTS OF AWESOMENESS......:) Awesome phone...no lags..no heating problem...great UI.... + Good Battery backup + Good Camera (front n rear) + Good connectivity + BETTER SCREEN in this price range - No Headphones with the box - Accessories not available in market
0|5|I am in love with this product. As everyone knows: nowadays selfies are more common and famous for all kind of function or any other moment. This fone has camera which is mind blowing. This phone has features like iPhone. It has 2GB Ram, 3030Mah battery wid the fabulous camera. I bought dis fone when a deal arrived on Diwali. This fone was available at a price of 9999/- i grabbed the deal and i gave galaxy y for 1000/- off and put an SBI card. So this phone is at a price of 8144/- and i am loving it. My friend bought the same phone by returning a better fone dan galaxy y. And she bought it for 7000/- Whole lot of customer satisfaction! Thank you Flipkart & MI ppl!
0|4|Excellent phone . Very good display and camera quality. No heating issue after the MIUI update was installed. The only problem is the ROM size of 16 GB which can not be expended. As a new phone I only got 9 GB free ROM.
0|5|I bought this phone in diwali offer, the phone really worth for that price. Pros - display looks great(best display at this price), Sexy and compact design, excellent performance, battery backup also good(1 day), both cameras are good. Cons - speaker performance is not good, MIUI has some bugs, phone heats while on heavy gaming(other time its normal), physical button feels cheap(making some noise), some noise is coming while shaking the phone(from internal parts, may be my phone's fault). Verdict - at this price this phone is worth.
0|3|Its all good except for one drawback that network goes of all of sudden and we have to restart it to make it online again.
0|5|Performance and look is awesome. i think i have chosen best product. i always recommend it to my frends.
0|4|best value for money phone. great phone, great software. camera is also good.
0|4|The delivery was on time. The finish looks great. The battery backup has been more than 24 hours for me. Sometimes heat up when you use it for long like having a call for more than 15 minutes. Otherwise an awesome phone.
0|3|I am the proud user of Mi3 and I loved that. With that confidence, i have purchased Mi4i. No doubt it is a beauty. but when it comes to performance, this has disappointed me like anything. Have faced issues with signal strength, call clarity, both mouth piece and ear piece. Hope the company will fix these with an update release. Think twice before you place the order.
0|3|Good performance, excellent screen and camera clarity Battery backup is poor How can I use multygouch in this phone?
0|5|Would seriously suggest go for this phone without any doubt. Very light in weight, awesome camera clarity, selfie lovers you will love this phone. battery also durable. sound output fabulous.no heating issue, i object as mentioned in many reviews as negative point.
1|5|Pros: 1. Camera 2. Design 3. Display 4. Price Cons: 1. Performance not very sturdy, due to throttling of Cores after update (still very decent) 2. Sound lower than Redmi 2 prime
1|5|Its been 6months, I purchased this phone from FK. I havent faced any issue, not even heating problem. Its a very good phone in this price. Just restricted with the memory of 16GB rest everything is excellent.
1|5|I chose this phone over Moto G3 which comes in the same range and somewhat similar specifications. Initially I was a bit skeptical over buying a Chinese brand, and the reviews of the Mi4i heating issue kept me confused for a while. But then I decided to go for it, and it totally outshines its competitors at this price. To those worried about the heating issue: Right after unboxing I updated the UI to MIUI7. The phone does not heat up at all during normal usage such as browsing, listening to music, playing games etc. However, it does get slightly warm if you play a high end game, application or a movie for long time, but that cannot burn your finger. In fact if you use a case, you wouldn't even notice that. The camera is excellent, beautiful display, performance is great, battery backup is unexpectedly awesome, and there are no lags. If you think you can live with 16GB of storage, go for it.
0|5|Mi 4i mobile was very nice & working was good. Improve battery life. Service centre are not available in andhra Pradesh state. Newly formed state.
0|5|hardware cam battery slim...everything packed! Software is an added advantage, so is the 441 ppi pixel density! Totally in love
0|5|nice look slim nd slim mobile very light waight very good battery backup more and more features in low price
0|4|It offers best camera, display and battery in this price range..... Its display and camera are comparable to any flagship. Only cons are in its UI ... Which appers to laggy few times especially while opening notification shade . if u have used stock android before, then u may not like it that much as 5his is case with me. But otherwise if we just focus on the phone on its own. It is good choice. And at last i must say it looks stunning.
0|5|i ordered this device @ 10k on Diwali sell they look 1 week to deliver...guys i can tell you that no phone can beat this phone in quality,feature and specially in rate though i got this in 10k but for 13k(current rate) this device is awesome. Key Features of Mi 4i: -compact Frame -2nd-gen Snapdragon 615 Processor -2GB RAM -16GB Flash -5 inch /1080p Display -Sunlight Display -Corning OGS Glass -13MP Sony /Samsung Camera f/2.0 aperture, Two-tone Flash -5MP Front Camera with Beautify -3030 mAh Battery - 4G Dual SIM -MIUI 7 on Android L my few review on device performance... battery backup: guys i m a gamer seriously it gives 16hr backup on extensive use,24hr with moderate use and if you use it for call,message,and litle game then it gives 30hr of backup which is according me is very descent backup. heating issue: most of the buyers main concern with this phone is heating issue guys believe me after updating to MIUI 6.7 and now MIUI7 the heating issue is almost null...and ya after extensive gaming for 2hr 3hr contentiously temp goes around 44 dgree which is pritty decent temp and this is for every phone not only for this phone ....so dont worry about heating issue... display:The Mi 4i has a JDI display which employs a range of colors that use full lamination technology for better contrasts. It also uses a technology to improve readability in sunlight. It is also protected by a Corning OGS glass to protact dispaly against scratches. no lagging issue...all games and app works very well....camera is pretty awesome specially front camera( selfy camera) ......
0|5|Mi4i comes with the specification which is Excellent cellphone with absolute value for money .............................
0|4|I will write only the negative points, apart from that everything else is good 1. Heating problem while charging, internet surfing and long duration calls 2. Low volume of ringtone, Vibration quality is also poor. you won't be able to sense the phone is ringing if you are at noisy area. 3. Auto key operation even in lock screen. Many times the phone started music and other operations while kept in pocket. tried every options still the problem exists. 4.Scratch resistance is very poor, i recommend you to buy a screen guard along with this phone. Still i recommend this phone. But think about your need based upon the four points i mentioned before buying..
0|5|The awesome phone in that price....very good looking phone and awesome UI camera is also good...very light in weight and runs without any lag
1|5|Simple... it is a good mobile. And thanks to the manufacturer. As of now its working good.
0|3|It Is not for good phone ASUS ZenFone 2 laser better mobile In this price. Mi4i heating problem
0|5|It is the best phone i have used so far. It is very well built and performs highly. No heating issues with mi ui7....it is a phone best in this range. As i got it for 6.7k with some offers and exchange policy of flipkart. Really great work by flipkart to.
1|4|Very good phone. Slows down when we get multiple notifications and when we try to switch in between the apps.
0|4|The Mi4i ticks all the right boxes with regards style, display, performance and camera. The MiUI is a very elaborate interface that gives it some differentiation over stock Android. At a reduced price now, a truly great 4G LTE phone.
0|5|Excellent phone . No heating problem what so ever.. And looks awesome.. Cam clarity is damn good.. But my battery drains very quickly
1|1|Hello all, I purchased mi4i recently,so phone is good but not great like moto products. MI brand need to update their products because when I used it's fluently getting message for sending bug report. Other problems is memory is inbuilt they not give facilities for extra memory. So please think about it and ALSO PRICES IS TOOOO HIGH.
0|4|Very nice phone with nice features in very competitive price
0|5|I brought this phone with awesome specification. I have MI 4 too with me. I found that camera quality of Mi 4i is awesome and better than MI 4. Friends, dont think even a minute to buy MI 4i phone in this budget. Just go ahead. Yes, agree some people reported the heating issue. You can get your phone replaced with Flipkart's awesome replacement policy. My Mi4i was getting hot so much that I cant even touch the screen close to my ear for a call. I requested for replacement. Flipkart's technician called me, asked me to install some app via which he can get utilization report of hardware and temperature. As per the app, phone temperature was 40 degree Celsius while company claims that the temperature till 50 degree Celsius is normal. I explained him that if internal hardware is getting heated then there is no problem. But my display is getting so much hot that I cant even hold it close to my ear. Technician suggested me to visit Xiaomi server center, and if service center acknowledges that phone has heating issue then Flipkart will replace my phone. Next what? in no time I visited the service centre and they acknowledged the heating issue. There were many people like me with MI 4i came to claim heating issue and Xiaomi service center are doing their job honestly. I took the copy of Xiaomi service center job sheet acknowledgement and submitted to Flipkart. Within a day Flipkart approved my phone replacement and now I have a phone without any heating issue. One of my friend also brought the phone and he is not facing any heating issue. I have an experience of all brands of phone - Nokia, Samsung, LG, ASUS, Apple etc. In every electronic manufacturing, some pieces are bound to get defective, then its a job of service centre to acknowledge and fix the issue. I am impressed with Xiaomi because if it would have been other company like Nokia they would have said heating issue is a normal and you might have played heavy game because of which phone is getting hot... blahh... blahh... and they just reject your claim, Also some people misinterprets warm and hot. Any phone (even apple) with high hardware configuration expected to get warm of long use. If phone is getting warm then that is not a heating issue. If you still not accepting then you should go for basic phone with only basic features like call and SMS.

0|5|good .product. delivery at perfect time. i am using it. but the sound low. that should be change in sound quality. camera is so batter
0|5|must have and good product. phone's quality is awesome weight is again considerable option . its slim sleek and good product.
1|5|good .product. delivery at perfect time. i am using it. but the sound low. that should be change in sound quality. camera is good.system of mi ui 7 is also good. overall performance for high lvl game is running good. but i play coc. the external memory is not provided by xiomi that is biggest fault and we have to buy otg code and pendrive.
0|5|1. Good Display 2. MIUI is gives you a rich user experience 3. speaker quality is good. 4. Dual SIM and both can be 4g
0|5|This mobile is best of businessmen,boys and girl In this mobile best features and good software support
0|4|i bought this phone during Big billion Day Offer. All functions and features are very good. But memory Limitations in MI 4I. that is a big drawback of this phone.
0|5|After using it for 6 months -Best thing about it is MIUI and processor -No heating issue -Touch is very good -Camera quality under low light conditions is not that good
0|4|Reading all reviews about Mi4i is surely to make you skeptical about the device. The reviews are mixed - some priaisng the specs in the price bracket, others complaining of poor performance and overheating issues. I got the device under exchange in the Diwali sale. I was looking for a replacement after my OnePlus was giving me issues. Was in a limited budget. so went for Mi4i. And I actually got for half its MRP!!! Now I am not a power user. i don't install custom ROMs. I don't overclock my processors and observe the throttle of the processor under the hood. I use the devices to make calls, play games, listening to mp3 and clicking a lot of photos. But like any other consumer I love snappy performance. Remember the Galaxy days when Touchwiz lag gave peptic ulcers to users? I've been there, done that. So no Samsung for me. Now to the device.. 1. Looks great. Weighs better. Light to carry around. 2. Performance is good. I am on MiUi7 For some reason FB keeps crashing randomly on my device. Other apps work great. With many apps open in background, device gets laggy at times. So you have to clear the RAM frequently. Wish this could have been better. 3. MiUi7 is a visual delight but heavy on the system. Reason for mediocre performance of a device with so much power under the hood. Okay for me, will give a headache to some because of noticiable lag. 4. NO HEATING ISSUESS!! Atleast in my device. I listen to music for long durations, take snaps and surf the internet. Never felt the device getting warm. This was the major complaint of users initially which Mi seems to have solved with MiUi7. 5. Camera is great. Quick autofocus. Great set of tweaks available. Dual tome flash also a great feature. 5. Display and sound are good as well. I use tempered glass on my screen given my history of dropping phones, otherwise screen is resistant to minor scratches. Loudspeaker is loud enough. A dimple at the back prevents muffling of sound when device is kept screen-up. If you always leave your phone on fluffy carpets, you may face a problem. 99% people don't and so not a deal breaker for us. As said before, I got the device at 50% of MRP thanks to the Diwali deal and exchange offer. So am very happy with the performance. Even then, the phone is good for an average user. ~~A word on Mi after sales service ~~ Mi service is crappy despite the company's best efforts. Service centre people are clueless idiots who don't even recognise Xiaomi's products and refuse service on flimsy grounds like "Mi doesn't manufacture this XYZ.. Where did you get this from?" Call centre people are equally incompetent. All they do is to give you assurance and complaint numbers, which are never followed up. You start over with your issues everytime you call and end up being referred back to service centres. I can tell this from my personal experience. So be wary of this potential risk when you buy a Mi device from sites other than Flipkart. Flipkart is the best place to get products for their no-questions-asked 30d returns. Hope you enjoyed the review. Good luck.
0|5|. Mi 4i a good mobile in d category. Cons--no SD card slot & non removable battery but it's performance : features and camera quality neutralizes it's cons. Flip cart delivery is time bond.
1|5|I had no problem with phone till date battery display all well
0|5|A very top class copy of Apple iPhone, in terms of interface, smooth operation, no lagging of multi tasking. Nice phone with excellent touch, an oil smudge proof coating is really outstanding, the phone does not heat up at all whatever multi tasking you do. And more over the battery life is superb....
0|5|The display and camera quality on this phone are unrivalled in the sub 20k segment. The battery life is very good, about 3.5-4 hours of screen on time and the standby time is insane(went to sleep with the battery at 92%, woke up 7 hours later, the battery was at 90%). The performance is acceptable. Routine daily tasks like messaging, mailing, photography, web- browsing and watching videos and movies is a breeze. Gaming is good when the phone is set on performance mode. The phone has never heated up in normal usage Does get warm while playing heavy games though,which is the case with every phone. The phone feels amazing in the hand and is very light and easy to use. Highly recommended.
0|5|mi 4i is most use full me . i like photography and their 13mp camera is very use full and 2 gb ram now i am happy with mi 4i. and only fo just.rs.8999 only
0|4|This is a Marvellous smartphone, works efficiently & gives a decent look. Battery life is also good works 2 days. runs smoothly on Wi-Fi and 4g network.
0|5|Got delivered in 4 working days. Phone is working good, nice battery life. you must spend some tome to get use to it. Lot to explore in this phone. Camera is working good.
0|4|One of the best budget phones..would had given 5 stars had the battery life been more than what it is.
1|5|At this price point this is VFM mobile with 2GB Ram and 16GB Internal Memory. I have updated it to latest software version and facing no issues. Camera is good and battery life is also good. Very comfortable for one hand use. Only drawback it lack external mSD slot. I bought Mi 4i in Sale with 10% off with SBI Cards.
0|5|I bought this mobile on May 28 shedding 13k and it simply does justice to the price tag. The best is its camera, and by best i mean the best. It competes and excels against the Moto X Play.Both the front and rare camera does wonder.The beautify mode on the front cam is lovely. You would love yourself in the selfie. The battery backup is flawless. It happily lasts me one whole day with internet turned on for 9-10 hours. The display is splendid. A great processor that runs games smoothly on the Performance mode.I love everything about this phone and I am totally obsessed about it. The only issue I faced Last month was regarding the adapter charger. It suddenly died but the service center guys took care of it. Although they took me over 25 days to replace my adapter which they promised within 15 days. As a buyer, I would suggest you not to go for any software updates and be content with what you get within the box. It awesome. Buy it surely. It is now 3k cheeper and totally worth it. Get the 32GB variant if possible.
0|5|There are 7days to purchase this phone. Camera and display are awesome. No problem at all except a little over heating. An excellent phone at this price. Flip karts service is good & fast.
0|4|Fantastic phone. Excellent performance. Its the really beast. Pros: Camera Processor Less Weight Display Frequent Updates
1|5|Don't believe the overheating reports. I was worried people talking about bad heating issue, I have not seen any overheating in default mode and am still able to play all the games I want.
0|5|Great Phone. Value for money.Exceeded expectations. A must buy.
0|5|Nice phone and fast delivery. I like flipkart... Got in 9999.Thanks flipkart
0|4|Xiaomi has resolved all the issues with this device...I think some performance has been compromised to resolve heating issue but that is not noticeable in daily usage...The display and the camera are a charm...Only letdown is only 10 gigs of storage available to user...Thats why 4 stars
0|4|I got it for Rs.9000 on Diwali sale. really happy with performance. battery backup is really good. interface is very impressive. Network is not much powerful compering my older HTC cell. but its minor and can be neglected.
1|4|no heating complaint from my side. works really fine. sound is good. display is awesome and performance is really smooth without any hanging. buy this if you are confused about various mobiles in this budget... u ll njoy it
0|5|Cons. : Heating on overuse. I felt very first day when I was configuring this phone as per my uses and was installing so many applications. was listening music and watching movie to check its performance. Heating point was just near to camera. I could feel it very easily when I took a call from my friend. Pros.: Full HD, Best in range 13 MP Rear and 5 MP front Camera , UI, Processor Speed, light weight and slim, User Memory, 2 GB Ram in this range Who should not Opt.: My personal view who talk for hours(3-4 hours cont.) and play so much game on phone should not opt this phone because of heating problem. I was very irritated by its heat which was felt near between my eyes and chick. Any suggestion: Feel If I could buy 32 GB variant. Best thing I like in this phone as per me even there are many but I am in love with this phone because of its cameras and its body. and as open this phone its UI attract me a lot. Additional + Point : If you are interest then xiaomi has very good user + developer community. Really worth to be part of that community if you are that type of people who want to do something different with this phone. As per my uses its 5 star phone even I took it in 9K. so It was a best pick for me.
1|4|I had purchased this MI4I mobile for 9999 and i felt worth to buy this mobile, really good camera, screen, battery etc i really happy to buy this and given has a gift. disadvantage of this is this is different type of Android because here you cant find the menu option , all apps stored inside the folders. in the Box they were giving the Head phone i really upset regarding this. let see how it will work.
1|4|only a external sd card slot is worrying, optional arrangements for space are irritating. a must product at the price range.
0|5|Bought it for my girlfriend. She loves it. Phone heats a little but not too much. Camera quality is awesome better than my Nexus 5. Phone is smooth and fast, it lags rarely. Perfect size, great screen.
0|2|I have purchased Mi 4i in the BIG BILLION SALE. so I am facing some problems. my handset hangs sometimes , takes time to think , gets heated up near the proximity sensor and even near the back camera .!! feeling frustrated.
0|1|Mi4i not upto the mark. you can't play games for more than 30 min due to heating issues. Lagging during multiple apps and games. Now winter is coming you don't need to purchase a heater because this phone can be used as a heater.
0|5|Really loved the new Mi41, is awesomely sleek, stylish and is awesome in performance in this budget segment. This is an awesome phone in this price range and many thanks to flipkart app deal where I got it still more cheaper.
0|4|Works pretty good, bought it on big billion day for a good price!!The delivery was late but satisfied with its performance so far. Faced no heating issues as complained by others I updated it to miui 7 which adorable.
0|4|I brought MI4i after lot of thinking. It is very good and stable. I also got the phone for Rs.8999 through app and thanks to sbi card the dual sim works beautifully. Value for money
1|1|yes, i have used this phone and returned back with in 2 weeks. while phone is all over good to use but it hangs sometime and apps use to be crash. The main thing is rear camera, that's why i bought this phone, and i din't get a quality camera. that is not a 13 mp camera, full of noise and blurry images. Not recommended. And also this is a Chinese phone, which can never deliver quality like sony or samsung, so go for ome other phone if you want quality.
0|4|I have been using this phone for about 15days. I think this is a very good phone for this amount of money you are paying for. Camera is really good , screen resolution is very good. Battery is much better than many flagship models out there.
1|4|Camera is good, But I am a frequent user of Internet on Mobile. From the DAY 1 , my internet access speed is very slow from the mobile operator. I don't , it is the mobile fault or operator fault. But Both said it is not our fault.
0|5|This is my 2st Xiaomi MI4i, i was a user of Samsung Note 3 & iPhone 5s. MI4i and excellent phone, Its flawless in every aspect. Please go for it. Well, 16GB is enough for storing songs 700mp3 and 50mp4 videos. Many people have complain about heating isue.Lets come to me perception , people who are saying its getting heated up during 1st boot& setting up the phone for the 1st time. i guess they haven't use any smart phone either. Its obvious while booting for the 1st time any phone will get heated up. Because all the applications will be running along with WIFI with highest performing speed to update apps UI, screen will be light-up for long time. Charging for 1st time may heat up a bit. leave the phone to get fully charged. use it for a day or 2. Turn off the 4G LTE, always use GSM for better call connectivity and a great battery life. You are not going to face heating issue . At least i am not facing any heating issue. Excellent phone, Its flawless in every aspect.
1|5|Been lucky with phones, 3250, C5, A-18, I8552, and now 4i. Everything is good with this phone. No heating issue so far. Camera is an underdog. Using it as a modem to connect laptop and hardly any heat issue. Update post 3 days: Display is amazing, and camera as well.
0|5|Amazing mobile i love it. Now am i update my mobile Miui7 extrationary perfroms.paaaaaaaaaaaa i love camera quality..lowest price to big gift.buy it now friends and enjoy your self.
1|5|its been almost 5months and am still in love with my mi 4i . everything about it is good. love the camera.
0|4|I like the phone. Its super light weight,feels as if we are not holding a phone good camera MIUI is a nice user friendly OS. I hope the phone does not die soon like other Chinese manufacturers
0|5|I got it for 9K during Diwali sale and after using it for around 3 days now I am really loving it. The best thing about this phone in my opinion is its design.
0|1|It is heating after 30 min use,also internet is very slow it is working like 2G in 3G data plan I bought Mi4i Phone from flipkart. I have been facing heating issues since the beginning and they keep release updates which are of size 800 MB + , but this issue will never solved. now MEmory card slot
0|5|Ever best phone by Xhiomi it will better than the moto series camera quality is superb..night beauty display(clear black display) miui 7 is ugradable miui 7 is also best...designed for mi platform I will suggest to my buddies to buy this one phone..
0|4|Got product delivered on time. After using 1 months I am very happy with the Mi4i. Only cons is little bit heating if we play for long time or long calls. Overall good product and value for Money.
1|1|I bought Mi4i Phone from flipkart. I have been facing heating issues since the beginning and they keep release updates which are of size 800 MB + , but this issue will never solved. These days I started facing issue with volume keys and power button, volume keys are not working at all now and power button some times work and some times not. Getting irritated when I want to on the display (imagine the situation where you want to make urgent call but power button will not work at that time) I feel Xiaomi company does do basic testing and release low quality mobiles in to marked just with name of 2 GB RAM and Octa core processor . They should check really does it worth. Skype do not work well, all of sudden voice will go away. Seriously a worst phone. My humble request to all , please do not encourage or buys these kind of company and its mobiles , they are really not worth at all. they made wit very cheap quality hardware inside it. Flipkart, Why you are encourage these kind of phones when you know this phone has issues. Please do not get the victim of this phone in that matter all Xiaomi phones.
0|4|Design: 8/10 Performance: 7/10 Battery life: 7/10 Camera: 8/10 Worth for Money: 8/10 I am facing slight heating issue (I am not a gamer) Performance lagging sometimes. Very bad connectivity(wifi and 3g) Overall satisfied.
1|4|Good specs!! looks stunning in white. Just got it today and can't expect much for what i spent on. It lags a bit after the Mi update. Mi should work on that and overall view is -- good phone. Don't expect much durability from this mobile, it looks like a snow white in a glass box and looks soo sensitive, buying a cover and guard would do the job but the problem is lagging after the update. i can tell Mi is working hard to make a mark but have to do a little bit more to get to the top. Screen is great, sound don't expect beats audio, didn't play any games yet, but i can say i don't care cause i don't play games on mobile, battery is great for now backup is 24hrs or even more if i use it for a little browsing, facebook, whatsapp, and some social apps and it depends completely on me about how well i maintain it can't and don't blame Mi or any such companies if u cant maintain your mobile battery.
1|2|Product not upto mark. Phone is very slow. Hangs often. Camera gets hanged often though picture quality is good. Overall product is not satisfactory
1|1|Pls dont buy its heated when you used more than 10 minutes..
0|5|Late delivery fro flipkart almost 10 (F) days. Hii i got this mobile on nov 10. after reading all reviews i felt that it has heating issue . but to my surprise there no such isues for my mobile even i am playing aspault 8 of 1.3 gb in that. Cons : less ram available pros: no need to tell stylish & wonderful design frequent updates excellent camera nice interface etc simply go for it ;)
0|5|this mobile is supper better than other but only thing i want to suggest is one who bye this product use after installing a tempered glass only because screen is very sensitive. i used for only one day i kept it in my backpocket it broke,im very sad about it
0|5|No heating issue as everybody mentioned here. The top feature is the display clarity which is comparable with the iphone 6s. Design is great, phone looks awesome. Anyway not just value for money, something more than that :D
1|5|very good product value for money, expandable memory card slot could have made the phone much better, delivery also prompt
0|5|I bought this phone during the big billion days at 10k..it came after 2weeks(yes, it was worth the wait)..miui is really good..no heating problem after updating the phone..performance is great..I tried real racing 3 and no problems at all(no heating too!)..the only 2 cons I think: 16b memory only(which is manageable) and speaker position: as my earlier phone was moto e and its speakers were in the front while in this phone's speakers are in the back side..So I think voice is low compared to what moto e had.. But these are very small problems..u will love the experience ..don't take the negative reviews seriously , just go for it..!!
0|2|I have purchased 2 piece of this mobile during this dasara/diwali festival season. After usage found each piece has some or other problem. Seems the lot which were built for this festival season are compromised with quality. Issue found: 1. In one of the piece my voice was not clear to opposite person. 2. Another piece was having screen display issue. Some of the tine there will be some multiple lines on the screen covering 10% to 25% portion of the screen and will go off after some time. I replace both the piece. I am still facing other issues with newly received pieces: 1. One piece now has network issue. It's goes off and keep trying to get the network. At the same time other phones gets proper network of same service provider. 2. The other piece is getting hanged very frequently. Even my friend too say they have hanging issue with this model. 3. Camera quality is not that good as it should be for 13 mega pixel camera. Pros: 1. The display quality is very good. 2. The look of this phone is very nice.
1|5|Mobile is too fast after loading 100 apps. We can delete any apps of google We can customize the data usage based on the app. Don't think just go for it.
0|4|this is best phone mi4i smart budget phone ....screenProvide a relevant, unbiased overview of the product. Readers are interested in the pros and the cons of the product. is very good ...sharp and truly colour..
0|4|GOOD LOOK, LIGHT WEIGHT AND GRT PERFORMANCE ,ONLY CONSENT IS BATTERY DRAINING MORE WHEN WE R USING 3G OR WIFI.....OTHERWISE SUPER PHONE
0|5|NYC product. Must try. Best mobile under 10k.good look,light weight
0|5|Display : full HD display, it was the only reason i had selected Mi4 as compare moto3g. and i am satisfied with quality of display. Battery : amazing battery backup, that i was not expected even. both front and back cameras are good. no heating issues at all but need to update with Mi before using first time,
0|5|Nice product looking amazing, performance is good. Display is smooth. Both cams are good. Device get heated 1st day of use after update the software no heating issue. Go for it.
0|5|Good response by flipkart.and after that mi 4i front camera is fabulous as campare to most high end devices.and very smooth response in every aspect. so go for it without any confusion.
0|5|Pros: Super design. Gives a rich look. Often people ask which Apple phone is this! :P Great camera Smooth touch screen Cons: No expandable memory. Low ringing volume and music volume
0|1|I purchased this product 1 week back, and getting heated up like anything. Heat is coming, and it lasts until i keep the phone idle for 5 min. Heat is not increasing too much but its not good for this product. Requested return, and discussion is going on.. let's see.
1|1|I had purchase mi4i before 3 months. and after use I said it s not gud buy... prons best display good look cons yes the display is gud and comes with ogs technology ,,,it said one glass solution... hum m there is problem my phone just drop from 2 feet hight and glass of phone is broken from bottom side. and bottom navigation key not work otherwise whole disply is ok but because of ogs I need to chane touch panel with display and its cost around5500/-
1|4|I purchased it since two months.its time for review. mi4i is pretty good mid range mobile. Experience: delivery was prompt and for each booting it took a little time. it was heating until i applied the update i have received.then all problems come to an end. since now i received three lollipop update from mi. IRON BOX?? no it is not an iron box.don't worry.the latest software updates have solved all problems, but if you play a hd game for 4 hours it will get heat. using WiFi for long time doesn't even burn it. but WiFi direct for a couple of hours will definitely heat t up as all smart phones do. GAMING: it runs almost all hd games smoothly.if it gives lag, just turn on performance mode and play.even ios cant beat it on performance mode. CAMERA: Its an awesome camera.You can expect a semi SLR quality images.night photos are pretty impressive. but video recording Quality varies from device to device. Cons: non expandable memory: purchase an usb/otg storage to solve this slippery matte finish back.so get a cover soon. Heating: The sfw update will fix it in seconds.
0|5|Mi4i have Great Pros like 1. Very sharp display quality without any lag 2. Very slim and sturdy. Extremely light weight. 3. Good camera both rear and front with added editing features 4. Very good touch & light response. MIUI 7awesome and super-fast. 5. Fast browsing experience 6. Clear audio 7. Faster WiFi & network capturing 8. Got 4G download speeds upto 1.8 Mbps Cons: 1. 12.77 GB free space for Apps only 2. No gesture control 3. Does not come with added accessories like earphones and scratch guard). 5. Low RAM availability (900MB-1GB max even after closing all apps) 6. Not very sure if it comes with Gorilla Glass (doesn't seem like it though) Many people say it has heating issues. Well I tested the phone by playing "Asphalt 8" in full graphics. It does tend to heat up slightly after playing for an hour, but which phone wouldn't? It is certainly not an area of concern. Please update the MIUI version as soon as you receive the phone (800 MB download) and you will not get any heating problems. I expected better results from the battery, and wish it was available in 64 GB version. Other than that, even without the earphones and scratch-guard, this is definitely the best buy of this season at this price.Pros: 1. Very sharp display quality without any spike/lag 2. Very slim and sturdy. Extremely light weight. 3. Good camera both rear and front with added editing features 4. Very good touch & light response. MIUI 6 awesome and super-fast. 5. Fast browsing experience 6. Clear audio 7. Faster WiFi & network capturing 8. Multiple key boards including Hindi, Bengali, Telugu and Tamil 9. Got 4G download speeds upto 1.8 MBPS (Airtel Postpaid- Bangalore). Cons: 1. 12.77 GB free space for Apps onlly 2. Does not come with added accessories like earphones and scratch guard 3. Low RAM availability (900MB-1GB max even after closing all apps) But Cons. can be maanagable.
0|4|Mi4i is an awesome phone in an average price. It is very smooth and fast. The phone used to heat a bit but later after the MIUI update it barely heats. The battery is long lasting and the camera is also excellent. The only disadvantage of this device is it doesn't have enough space. But if someone is comfortable with 16gb of memory it will be the best phone for them to handle. I have been using it since a week and it's a great phone.
1|5|Nice Mobile.................................................. Looks are great. Though I found it getting heated on some occasions. Still this one is good Mobile.
0|4|A great value for money phone by Xiaomi. I would suggest it over the Moto X Play. If you look at the processors, both are identical. The screen is full HD for both of them. Moto X Play has a slight higher capacity battery but it costs about 5k more. Looks are great too. I strongly recommend this phone.
0|4|I ordered Mi 4i white, from flipkart app on October 29th and after finishing transaction, got sms that it will be delivered on 6th of Nov. But they delivered it within 3 days and whenever I tracked the package in app, it showed me where exactly it is being shipped from, where is it now etc. Good that flipkart is so transparent. OK, about the phone, it is very cool looking. Very light weight. Lots of features. As I was having a Windows phone before, need to take time for operating android. White colour is really very charming but flipkart didn't make blue available as it is my fav colour. I think flipkart should make all colour variants avbl. Overall good experience with Mi 4i. Slight heating problem. If I use for more than 10 mins, phone heats up a bit. Few features r still in experimental mode. Lock screen display font colour can't be changed. This makes me unable to set wallpapers that have white. Also the back button "<" doesn't activate in 1 touch. Need to press it 3-4 times. But all other features r pretty cool. Worth for âÂÂ?¹8999 as I got extra 10% discount using standard charter card. I recommend this phone and I liked it.
0|4|nice look,light weight,great performance ...product is value for money... ......... fast delivery .flip kart offer give more discount so product is valuable in that price.
0|4|I used Mi3 for more than one year. Recently I bought Mi4i during Billion day offer. Pros: Convenient to handle Smooth edges Good looking and Great Design 4G compatible Dual SIM Less weight Camera quality is superb when compared with Mi3 As of now I haven't faced any Heating issue. Need to check after upgrading to MIUI 7. Cons: I feel Mi3's performance is better than this model We need to cut the normal sim card Sound quality is not that much when compared with Mi3 2G connection performance is very poor. Not sure whether this problem is with this mobile or service provider. In overall I am satisfied with this mobile for the price which I purchased.
1|5|Good service product provided by Flipkart. Also, it has been 7-8 months I am satisfied with Mi 4i Phone.
0|4|upgraded the 7.0 OS .This phone is competing iphone.....great UI design .. superb phone ,stable OS build . this can be alternative who is frustrated with Android UI.
0|1|HEATING ISSUE BATTERY DRAIN ISSUE CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT LIKE 13 MP NON SUPPORTED EXPANDABLE STORAGE IS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE FRONT CAM DOEST HAVE FLASH
0|1|This product is not good... Getting struck during using internet.... And also struck mobile in sometimes during playing games........ And also heating very much
0|5|Awesome mobile No words to say about phone after using for six months
0|2|just got my phone yesterday, it has serious heating issue . I used the phone for 10 mins just for call and it heat up considerably was unable to hold it near my ears.
0|5|So slim... Awesome looks.... Stunning display... Mighty camera........ The best part is MIUI...........
0|2|No voice clarity. Once i switch of the mobile it takes more time to switch on. And other minor problems.
0|5|I purchased Mi4i recently & i got a amazing result. As per technical specification is concern its gonna mind blowing in a middle range price. And as per other factors it is too good as compare to other brand. 1. Camera is awesome.(both Front and Rear). 2. No heating issue at all. 3. Extra long battery backup. 4. Great internet connectivity with 4G LTE. 5. Perfect built. 6. UI and UX is awesome. 7. Overall speed is great. If you want a godd smart phone in mid range price go for it. Got a perfect piece. Thanks MI.
0|5|Best phone at such a low price. Only has a heating problem. Best phone compared to other big brands
1|5|Very good mobile Better camera Exllent features Bettery low but not bad
0|5|Completely satisfied with the product. Must say Mi has done an awesome work here. One of the best phones in this price range. Don't play heavy games or run draining apps for long and expect the phone to stay cool. This is absolutely normal and don't get blown away by negative reviews. Try it and you won't regret. Thanks Mi and Flipkart.
0|4|This is an excellent phone under 13K. excellent camera, display, and no heating once you update the MIUI. heating only takes place when you play heavy game. some minor issue, ringer volume is a bit low
1|1|I am using Mi4i from last 7 months. . But touchscreen damaged in 4-5 months. It is not happening for other branded product like Nokia or Moto G. And repairing price for touchscreen is 4500. If you have insurance then it is free, but insurance fee is 1000 for 1 year. Do you think it is worth ? Please think twice before buying Mi4i.
0|1|using this phone for last 3 months, regular heating issues, battery draining and continuous lagging.... one should rally avoid this phone....
1|1|Bought this product for just 9000 after starting the phone got to know that its not mobile it's a frying pan in form of mobile with OGS. -Hangs- too much heating around 4centigrade.From 2gb ram only 80available. -Shows 12.77 gb as user memory from which only 10 gb available.(even product replaced) -MIUI is better -Both the cams are best. -hangs in multi tasking.
0|5|excellent mobile last week i order mi4i at 9999 . its look like an iphone and aswell camera was superb. buyers go for it.and wait for the offer.
0|5|Mi giving great quality product Mi 4i with great screent quality and overall performance All Heating issues have been fixed in MIUI7 go for it excellent delivery by flipkart....
0|5|its a nice smart phone. very cutting edge looking. felling premium phone. not heating issue so far. display awesome. MIUI is awesome. its very smooth. specification is very high at this price point.
0|5|I was an iphone 4 user for a long time and had made my mind recently to upgrade my device. I was looking for a mobile that would accommodate two sims (to reduce the hassles of carrying two phones - one personal and one official), would have 5 inch FHD display, 32 GB memory or support for external memory,good battery back up (around 3000 mAh), good brand value & service, good value for money and the latest snapdragon processor with at least 2GB RAM (I was looking for snapdragon 8xx series), support of 4G in India, and decent back & front camera (I am not that photography enthusiast). I was searching through the web for around 2 months, reading reviews from various sites, understanding features and specs, observing price variation in different sites of various make (my budget was around Rs. 15k) etc. In short, I wished to make an informed decision and did not wish to end up buying a wrong product. I had already ruled out iphone as it did not support dual sims, secondly they are too expensive and personally I do not any longer consider them good value for money). So, I was left out with only andorid devices as there was no point in buying MS (Nokia) or other OS products because of their less popularity. Xiaomi Mi4i perfectly fitted my requirement, but there were two things that bothered me and hindered making a quick decision. One was, heating issue ( I read in various reviews about it) and second was it did not support eMC, and neither the 32 GB variant was available in India (neither in Flipkart, Amazon, Snap Deal or even Xiaomi's official website), sadly it is still not available in India. Also, there was news of Mi4C releasing in India with similar specs and slightly upgraded processor (it was released in China in Sep '15 but till the time of writing this review, it is not released in India). In such a perplexed situation of deciding which device to go for I even missed the Big Billion Sales offer of Flipkart as I was expecting release of Mi4C at that time or availability of 32 GB variant but neither happened. Fortunately,by end of Oct, Flipkart again came up with Diwali offer, and the price of Mi4i 16 GB dropped to Rs. 9,999/- (from 12,999/-) and I did not wish to miss this opportunity and immediately ordered my Mi4i 16 GB White. Already, I had found in some of the reviews that Xiaomi addressed the heating issue by using Snapdragon 615 chip instead of sd 801, and also by means of software update (MIUI). Delivery of Flipkart has always been excellent, and during this time they quite unexpectedly surprised me by delivering the product 7 days in advance. I was extremely delighted to receive it. Packaging was good enough, and I received the product in good condition. The unboxing was simple and since I had to migrate from iOS to android so it took me a few days to install (and link) most of my earlier apps. Also, I had upgraded the MIUI (around 800 MB) at the first opportunity of accessing wifi. After using the device for around 5 days now, I would say that the device is excellent and I would recommend it to any one who wishes to buy a smartphone within 10-12k. I am more than happy using this product. Now, I will briefly outline the pros and cons of the device: Pros: 1) FHD display, very sharp display even under bright sunlight 2) Camera quality is decent ( though I am not a photography enthusiast but it very well serves the purpose of the day to day photography), front camera is also very good for taking decent selfies. 3) MIUI is very comfortable to use 4) I play games like Asphalt Nitro, Boom Beach, 8 ball pool etc. 2 - 3 hours a day and did not face any heating or lagging issues especially after OS update. 5) Very good battery back up - after normal use (1 - 2 hrs calling, net surfing, playing games and watching videos etc.) it easily runs through out the day. I am still left with some more power at the end of the day. For power users, it may vary. 6) Very good value for money - there are hardly any other products at this price from any other reputed manufacturers that one can trust. 7) Call quality is very clear, and sound quality is also good with a pair of decent in ear headphones (I use Sennheiser headphones) Cons: 1) No support for external memory, neither the 32 GB variant is available ( I might someday run out of memory as user gets slightly less than 11 GB which would soon fill up, however, it supports OTG so, I hope it would not be a very big worry). 2) The usb charging point should have been easier to plug in and out, it feels somewhat rigid now. I do not see any other limitations in this product at the moment and there's no reasons that stop giving 5 stars for this product. Thank you Flipkart and Xiaomi for bringing this product to the consumers at a very competitive price. I am loving it. (NB: I'll come back again after using this product for some more time and update if any issues have been faced)
0|4|Well this is a grt smartphone in its price range. I purchased it during an offer which reduced the price by flat 3k. The smartphone is very sturdy, elegant, compact. According to me there are more pros n a few cons regarding this phone. Pros: 1. Great display(fhd with ogs and 441 ppi) 2. Great battery which gives easily 1.5 days backup on moderate usage. 3. High speed lag free performance 4. Dual sim with 4g support 5. Miui with lot of customization capabilities. 6. 13mp rear camera and 5 mp front camera both capable of fhd video recording 7. Backlit touch capacitive buttons 8. 2 GB ram 9. Led notification light (can be customised) 10. Loudspeaker at the back which is fairly loud. 11. Great build quality and unibody design. 12. Supports usb otg. 13. Sunlight display is a nice feature works well outdoors as well indoors and enhances viewing. Cons: 1. Limited storage(16gb) but can b incresed using otg pendrive 2. No micro sd card slot. 3. Non removable battery. These were the pros n cons according to me. I did notice heating of phone a few times but it wasn't that high. The camera quality is gud. I received the product aft around 2 weeks of placing the order. So not satisfied with delivery service but the phone is a value for money. Best in its class.
0|5|Awesome mobile as compared with the other mobile brand. 2GB RAM,13 Mega pixel (rare) 5 Mega pixel (front) camera...Pictures taken from Mi4i are too clear as compared with pictures taken with other mobile brand having 13 Mega pixel camera..
1|4|Mobile is Light weight and looks are alegent. Performance vice its very good. battery is also good. charger and data cable quality is also nice. Value for money. i got this at price of 8999/- during deewali sale while its actual price is 12999/-
1|5|Bought it for 8999 promotional offer.. worth its money Heating issue are cleared once updated to latest UI Charge stands for 1 whole day on average usage of applications and games, calling internet Charges vewy quickly Handy Phone awesome looks .. Go for it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
0|5|I'm using XIAOMI phone for last 1.5 years. They never disappoint you. This phone is also awesome when it comes to build quality, display and touch sensitivity. I wont be able to tell if battery is good or not. But on spec this is good phone. I got this for 10K which is a deal and I give 5 start for amazing features under 10K
0|5|Excellent mobile with cost variation I bought it for Rs 12999 first mobile replaced with a new one due to updation issue second one is good with all features mentioned
0|5|all things are best. only heating issue. you can avoid that because every android mobile have heating issues.
0|4|Mobile Is very nice but this time MI didn't provide Screen Gard with Mobile may be this is bcoz I purchased it in Offer else product is 5 Star...............
0|1|Initially phone works very well till now but after updating MIUI to 7th edition phone heat up too much that it becomes unable to be touched. Also the camera is somewhat protruding and the flash is not much as it. there is no any way to reduce the heating of the phone and another one thing it was hanging up sometime and gets switched off automatically. when i put phone near to ear its screen still remains lighten up and after removing the screen still remains hibernated. resolve the issue
0|4|Good ones: Flipkart delivery - before promised date & time Packaging - clean and sweet Display - excellent Sound - very good Camera - neat and simple Battery - powerful UI - one of the best Bad ones: Call connectivity - not the best Storage - only 10 GB of 16GB is available RAM - max 950 MB out of 2GB available Apps - okie-dokie Accessories - none with the box Buy it only if you get an discounted price
0|3|The product is awesome..good camera(Both)..size is handy..slim... But there is a lag for front camera.. One problem is There is no Headset in the box....
0|5|I hv been using this for past 6 months. Great phone with great features. But the phone heats up at times but its acceptable. No second thot, go for it.
0|5|The phone is really nice. Highly recommendable for this price range. The touch response is good also the camera is not bad.
0|4|Initially i had multiple issues with the new Mi4i phone like SIM card not deducted, Reboot not working, Power off taking more than 15 minutes, Invalid IEMI code and Can't get device id. But finally i found the solution for all the issues(after 4 attempt of factory reset). Once I upgraded to 6.7.2, all problem was solved and it is perfect now. I learned lot of things about Android and MIUI stuffs. But not everyone would be like me:-). Thanks to MIUI forum and flipkart customer support.
0|1|the supplied Airtel sim need to re-charged at Air tel retail shop, it is boring and get feedback from friend that Airtel asked all the documents for activate in free 4G sim like new sim. However, as per practice the free sim supplied to be activated immediately , once get inserted in to phone.
0|5|I have been using this mobile since May and have recommended this to many of my friends. I haven't faced any issue and has not hanged even once.
0|4|Phone really looks awesome and quite manageable to perate with single hand. Display: Superb Display with Full HD resolution Volume: Crystal clear and preferably use ear phones make like skull candy or sennizer to enjaay the music from this phone Hardware: The snap dragon Processor looks to have issue and that probably the reason for heating. But started using a back cover so i didn't felt the heat in general Camera: Awesome camera Front/back Memory: There is compromise on memory which you have to manage by taking frequent backup based on how many photos and videos you take per month. MI UI: I have installed the latest stable UI MI UI 6.7. Excellent UI customization possible with MI UI 6.7. Yet waiting on the MI UI 7 version. This might resolve some more general issues we have with UI. Battery: Battery looks to draining quickly when you compare with other phones like zen phone 2 with same batter capacity and have 5.5 inch screen too. This having 5 inch screen still consumes more batter may be because of full hd resolution and due to memory intensive UI to get processed. Need to optimize batter use for UI by Xiami. For now you get the batter back up for a day even for a heavy usage of videos, games, calls etc. Overall I am happy with this phone even though there are some dis appointments with batter, heating issues majorly. Xiami need to work on these issues ASAP to make this a wonderful phone
0|1|Heating problem with MI 4i everytime I use it. Either using internet or normal phone call its motherboard is getting heated constantly. I would advice not to buy MI 4i.
0|3|out of 16 GB you barely get 11 GB to use. Storage is big issue here. Heating is also issue. Go for Asus Zenfone 2 GB.
1|5|Very good phone.. its been more thans 5 months.. really good.. but one negative feedback on Heating..
0|3|It's has 2 GB RAM but only 700 MB will be free, ti's shows 12 GB free for user but it's only 10 GB, when you take more more pic in HD mode that time camera will be Hang,
0|5|Stylish, light weight, good looking. I just love this phone. Delivered on time. No issues seen so far.
0|5|Superb Display Excellent Sound Blazing fast processor Quick charge Overall good value for money phone.
0|3|Camera and screen resolution is good. But Phone is heating within 10 mins use. i recommand this to anyone want to buy best phone below 10K.
0|5|What I wanted in a Mid range device I have got it and it has a very good feel in hand and build quality is also very nice...Performance is the best part of this device...I must say go for this one..
0|5|Phone Looks very slim and Stylish..Nice phone from MI..Only complain their Customer service after sales..Requesting please better your Customer Service..We all know you are new in India
0|5|Great Phone. Bought this phone almost 2 months back. Good battery Good Screen Very light Weight No lags yet.
0|5|This Is a Perfect Phone For Gamers As There Is a Performance Mode There In the Menu And The New Miui 7 Update Has A lot Of Themes So It can Fit Our Mood The Only Spec Problem Is The Memory Slot But The New 32 GB Mobile Is Perfect At 13,000 Rupees. Its Worth Buying it But One More Thing Is That Plz Do Use a Case And Tempered Glass As the Smooth Back Body Gets Hurt.So Its Ultimately Useful.
0|5|Phone is worth for the price and quality and MiUi is fantastic. Thanks for fast delivery as usual. Please keep it up.
0|5|Mi4i is great in terms of specs, built quality & design, display, camera, perfomance, etc considering that it is a mid-range smartphone and there are only a couple of other smartphones that can match it. The heating issue of Mi4i has been regarded as its biggest drawback but it is something you will find in any other smartphone so by no means a deal breaker and an update has already come which has reduced the heating considerably. My take a very good buy in the 10-15k range if not the best.
1|5|I have read all reviews for Mi 4i on flipkart, much has been said about heating issue of the phone and flipkart's appalling return policy. I somehow felt compelled to share my experience with flipkart. I recieved a faulty product, the display was damaged. I submitted a return request the next day and have now recieved a new device. The whole process was so smooth and hassle free. Also the phone is awsome, I am not going into details here. Regarding the heating issue it is practically non existant after updating the phone.
0|5|My son is using this product since last 3 months. It is very good, light weight, very good display, camera with almost all features with excellent picture quality. The only drawback is no expandable memory. I suggest to buy this product.
0|3|Mobile is good but USB charger cable is worse. I think cable frequency is 1A. Its taking 10 Minutes to Charge 2% Battery. If Company anything supply with mobile then Part should be usable not like this. on this point i will give 1 rating but on Mobile side its 4. MI must need to look into this. I have another cable of Capdase brand and its charging 100% in 1 hours.
1|5|Hi everyone!! Few days before I planned to order this phone but after reading the reviews I got a bit confused but even then I ordered it. Guyz let me tell you that there is no heating problem in the phone if you update the UI (automatic upadate option will be prompted) its approximately 705MB in size. The camera quality is also good and the UI is too good. The performance is also up to the mark when considered according to the price.
0|5|I have done lot of research before purchasing this phone. At last came to know he is using the same for last 4 months and he said its amazing. I ve decided to take a taste. First of all thanks to Flipcart for delivering the product 7 days before the expected delivery date. I purchased this phone in Big Billing Day sale and got amazing deal and exchanged my old Samsung Grand Duos. Now come to the performance of the phone. I am using this phone for few days ad found no problem. Pros ---- There is no heating issue in the phone as I observed in many review. Intially there is 876 MB update to be done. Phone is running very smooth. UI is like silk touch. Camera in daylight is very good. Flash is working fine. Full HD display is awasome.... The phone is very slick and looking stylish enough to hold on Cons ---- There should be option to add external memory card. with 16 GB phone user get 10.5 GB spapce for usage.
1|4|There will be issues with any phone that we buy. Regardless of good features that are preset in every phone, I need to mention the bad in this phone. 1) Heating issue: The phone started emitting heat within the first few minutes after i on the phone. If I leave the phone without using, I can feel less heat. Using too many apps or internet may burn your hands. 2) process com.google.process.gapps stooped working: I experienced this error after i entered into PlayStore and the error didn't got stopped whatever i did in my phone. It continued to blink on the screen until I opt to reset my phone. After resetting the phone, the error has been stopped. As it was a new phone, I decided to reset. It doestn't seems to occur in every phone These are the major issues in this phone. All the other features are very fine. UI of the phone is very attractive. No software issues. Camera is good. If you can bare the heat, this phone can make you feel happy.
0|4|Really a good product and please go for this device. I found lots of review comments regarding heating issue which I denied. I used to browse more than 2 hrs continuously, but not getting the feel of heating issue. Camera is awesome. Had nice click too. Thanks MI & Flipkart for this phone.
0|4|The Device is look good and works very fast. The touch is very sensitive and so smooth. camera is fine with all atmosphere. The reason i gave only 4 star is about the delivery and service. I am a flipkart first customer, even though this product doesn't show faster delivery it came very fast for my friend who is not a Flipkart First customer..!! but to me it took two weeks.!!. To be honest this is the first time happening.
0|4|I have used this for 5 days now. It is decent product for the price i bought. Camera quality is great. Look and feel of the phone is very good. Battery life till now is great, even with 3G and Wifi on. As everyone said. Phone does heat up a lot. i did system update still it does heat up. If you want to buy a phone for streaming videos online, playing games, then this wouldn't be the right choice.
0|5|flipkart keeps its prmonises and thats why i m a valued customer. I recommen to all everytime for online purchases from flipkart. Best valued for the product. However missed the offer zone.
0|5|best camera best performance best front camera no heating problems
0|3|It is just one week and the problem is the battery percentage is stuck up 100% Rest all the configuration are the best
0|5|Good phne nyz battery backup camera awsome for selfie back cam also suprb....... Sensor's are also gud and a little bit heating prblm bt nt much heating Main problem is storage..... Hope MI. Will do sme thng.. Toexpand memory....... Am not satisfy with the delivery its take 10 days:-(
1|4|Pros... very good display, look, sense of touch, UI, weight less Cons... Over heat problem not rectified till No headset
0|3|value for money 16 gb of internal memory is good but still over heating is a big problem
0|5|What ever you what in a smart phone you will get it in Redmi 4i, Great design, Display, camera..............! the only thing which I would appreciate that they can give a memory slot or as CEO of Company said that memory card slows down the speed of Phone than at least raise 16gb Memory to 32gb that will raise the bar one more step ahead................! All said and done, but within this budget, you get a superb phone to use so don't think too much and have it..............! Cheers to Redmi Team.
1|5|I bought this phone in a diwali deal at an additional discount of 3000 Rs. Believe me, at this point of time, no other phone can come near to this one - be it weight, hardware, specs, anything ! I was also confused to buy this one reading many negative opinions, but still went for it to have hands on experience. The phone hanged a little bit, when I opened the box, soon after connecting to wi-fi it asked for an update of around 842 MB & it took about 9 hrs for complete download - as server was bit slow. But, once I updated the device, it became smooth & swift ! Camera quality is awesome in day light ! Best bet for this price. I forgot to mention about MiUi, it's awesome single package, no need to download third party apps for cleaning of RAM, antivirus, internet usage manager, etc.
1|5|FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS I AM USING THIS MI4I AND I AM PURCHASING SECOND MI4I FOR MY WIFE NOW.GOOD PHONE AFTER THE FIRST UPDATE NO HEATING PROBLEM .
0|4|This is a great phone. Everything is great. just one catch. It was no SD card slot and the in phone memory is not sufficient if you download movies.
0|4|Phone is good. However in camera quality is not so good as compared to Samsung Galaxy core (presently I am using). Display is very good, Sun viewing is really good. Overall it is a good smartphone. .
0|4|Very Nice looking color with handsome features.with 13k range. Good user interface and performance is superb. Design wise also good.
0|2|Product is good, but main important feature certificate import is not working. because of that i am unable to connect to office wifi or corporate email with certificate authentication. :(
0|5|Pros: Nice phone with all required features, light weight, Full HD display is quite impressive and in budget more important. Happy to have it in flipkart Diwali offer. COns: Only Cons i found sound quality not good.
0|4|Best phone + Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS - No headphones - lack of accessories in market
0|4|Pros: Great Design, Compact phone, Good built qualiy Not so large 5 inch HD display Powerful battery Dual standby SIMs with 4G support Good camera Cons: Heating issues Memory Card not supported Sometime it lags a bit
0|5|Awesome product, good packaging and quick delivery, cheap price (9999 INR Only. I love this phone coz of its compact size,rich features and lot of themes and other advance custom features, I highly recommend this product coz of 2 reasons, 1- its resolution, 2-battery backup and themes/other handy features as well.
0|4|Thanks flipkat for your unexpected immediate delivery. It supposed to deliver on 26/Oct/2015 but delivered on 20/Oct/2015. Phone looks very slim and camera clarity is nice. only little feel on package without headset. Phone specifications says that, "In the Box Handset, Charger, USB Cable, User Guide".
0|5|I Love this Phone on top is processing is gud. RAM is Good .Camera is Good both Rear and Front... Love this Look...of the Phone at this Price.After All All good thing is there one drawback of the phone it whole depend on Internal Memory no SD Card Slot..
1|5|very good display because of 1080p and 441 ppi display.exellent camera,heating problem 90% solved after letest update.battery is good and miui rom is best.u will be satisfied after using this phone
1|5|this is the best smartphone i have ever used ! there are no heating issues once you update the device ! it is a beast!
0|4|Been using this for 4 months now..Its a wonderful phone at this price. The front camera is comparable to iphone 6 and apt for selfie. I keep only a few apps and do not play any games so there aint any heating problem for me. Sometimes, occasionally it do hangs while surfing FB and a few other apps. The phone doesnt hang up, the app hangs. Usually happens with only FB. Overall, a great product at this price.
0|5|BEST PHONE IN SMART PHONE, i like MI........................................ ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|3|good product and battery, camera ,responsiveness are good but the spare parts are not easily available
0|4|Camera Awesome.. No Heating problem... Battery Backup is good.. Sometimes getting hanged even I have more than 500 mb ram available. External Speaker Sound volume is very low. I also have redmi 2 but when I compare both, sound volume of Redmi 2 is more than Mi 4i.
0|4|If you are buying this phone just going by specs...then thats good.... but beware....HEAT HOT WARM....these words you will see come in real to Mi4i .....yes ....but going to its positive side..... > CAMERA=...best in its range......(BUT 1080p video stutters a lot) > MiUi INTERFACE= yes the 2 GB ram and octacore bumps up everything to make the Ui more better smooth ...and even better than its dad Mi4... >GAMING=awesome awesome ......just throw any game.....(BUT REMEMBER TO USE PERFORMANCE mode only in heavy games) >THE "HEAT": Well you have to update immediately to any new updates....N YES THERE HAS BEEN LESS WARMING AFTER update..... >THE BEST WAY TO NOT OBSERVE HEAT IS TO USE A THICK SOFT STYLISH COVER THAT WILL PROTECT....
0|5|I was amazed at the build quality and the features that this phone comes with. One word Superb!!. I love it -slim with round edge for easy grip. Looks premium and most of all Superb performance. One of the best Phone in the price range. Guys go for it ...another Satisfied Customer of Mi.
1|5|using this product from last 4 months ... working fine and still no problem has noticed. One drawback I have noticed is the loudspeaker sound ... which should be a little highar
0|5|Hi.,., i am using writing this mail after using 90 days., Redmi4i is a good mobile. In my experience i am telling that it is very easy to usage,.cam front/back both are good., resolution is very gud. Touch is very simple.. For past 90 days i don't have any minus points in this model. So,. i suggest this model. Thaq Flipkart.
0|1|I bought this mobile 4 months back and had to give it to service center 3 times till now. Faced motherboard problem, front camera was not working and heating issue. Right now the touch screen is not working at all. I feel like throwing the phone into dustbin. Please dont go for this cheap quality phone. They dont even have a replacement policy from company in warranty period.
0|5|A SUPER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE AND GIVEN THE CLARITY, SPEED AND SPACE, WITH THIS RANGE, THERE SHOULD BE MORE BUYERS. WE LOOKING FOR A GOOD PHONE IN AFFORDABLE PRICE CAN AND SHOULD EASILY HAVE THIS EXCELLENT PHONE.
1|1|I have bought Mi3 mobile on 29/07/2014. Till the warranty periods ends, it was working properly. But exactly after one year and one month, the mobile became useless. It was not getting power on. I went to Mi service center, and they told me mother board has some problem and will cost Rs.8000 and if you dont want to repair it, they are ready to buy it for Rs.1000. So I understood that, this is their strategy. " Till the warranty periods, no issue and after one month mobile will be useless. So if you want to use it for only one year, go for it..... otherwise buy some good brand mobile. My rating is "0"
1|5|Pros: 1. Water Proof, I accidentally dropped my mobile in the water bucket and after one minute took out my mobile and my phone still working absolutely fine.(Which is unbelievable for me) 2. No lags: Able to play Asphalt without any lag. 3. 2 GB Ram: Decent ram for OS and for other aplication 4. Pretty slim mobile. 5. Both camera's are good but not best. Cons: 1. Phone gets heats up but bearable. Previouslly i was using Samsung and that phone also gets heat up almost same temperature. 2. Slippery body.(Water Bucket Accident)
0|3|phone is heating a lot but camera is good overall if heating issue is resolved its best phone in the price.
0|5|best thing about this is display and touch best touch i have ever seen so far. very fast response and beautiful display only disadvantage is internal memory just go for it, u will love it
0|4|I have purchased MI 4i on 8 th October 2015 & after using for the whole day with a fear in mind about the heating issue, I surprisingly did not felt any kind of heating issue from the first boot as it was already loaded with MIUI v 6.5.5. So please don't fall into the confusion of not purchasing it as its the best mobile in its price tag of Rs.12,999.00.
0|4|As these are in same range devices i want to share my experience of using all these 3 devices. comaprisions: - elegant display of 1080p mi4i , moto g3 720p display but sharp , J5 amoled display viewing angles are good. - battery life also good pass easily a full working day( Need to use updated miui always) , as per moto g3 also have good battery life , J5 also have the same battery life as comparisons to both these devices. - camera quality of mi 4i excellent no one can beat it as off better than 20000 price range , moto g3 day light pics are excellent but not good in low light conditions, J5 pics are also excellent but not better than mi4i - sleek body easy to handle of mi4i , g3 is handy designed phone, and J5 also handy as per same design by Samsung always - .Mi4i heats up a lot, g3 is cool always and same as samsung J5 also. - build quality of mi4i is decent, g3 is solid built uality as water proof body, J5 build uality is not up to the mark its mearly plastic body only. verdict want to use smooth and buttry android experience go for MOTO g3, for camera mi4i J5 only brand preferences and its price is also less as comparisons to both these devices
0|5|super smooth never find any lag full hd display best ever front camera best gaming experice super battery back up
0|5|mi41 is beauty .lightweight,highspeed,oustanding camera sleek design fully satisfied with mobile best phone under 13k.
0|1|Dear All, This phone has got very poor Internet Connection. It never connects to a 2G,3G or 4G. It Supports only Wifi. I never Excepted this kind of Product from MI.
0|1|I purchased this phone around three months back. I use this phone sparingly i.e. once or twice a day. Still it started giving me trouble all on a sudden after a month and a half. Suddenly it was not charging and the display showing whether it is charging was not coming up. Also, it was hanging while rebooting. I gave it for servicing and they did full reset and gave it. It worked for a couple days and again gave the same problem. I gave it to servicing again and they replaced sub-pcb and gave it back. Now it started showing no-service even though it is detecting the SIMs. So, the phone has become useless. Again I am planning to give it to servicing. In the past three months, I used the phone only for 1.5 months, rest of the days it was in servicing. Also, I had to spent money and time travelling to this distant service center. I have used Nexus, Motorola, Palm, Samsung phones before, but never even once I faced a situation like this. My advice: AVOID THIS PHONE!
0|3|Mobile looking nice but battery is decreasing very fast,performance is also slow,and there is no extendable option we have only 16GB internal memory
0|4|Great display, good UI, decent camera, bad battery and average build quality. Not a phone for heavy users. Good as a spare phone or for someone with moderate use.
0|1|.mi 4i mob screen has been cracked .i also dont know how this happen .cost of screen replacement is around 7000 RS .so waste of money. mobile itself is about of RS 13000.no proper service center in mumbai . they are far away from us . so use your mob carefully .screen is not good.never apply high pressure on it...
1|1|hi i am using this device since 3 months and phones gets heat up when we talk continuous for about 10 mins and while surfing using mobile data also mobile is getting heat and hangs on i request better to stop buying mi4i mobile .
0|5|This is my 1st Xiaomi MI4i, MI4i and excellent phone, Its flawless in every aspect. Please go for it. Well, 16GB is enough for storing songs 600mp3 and 30mp4 videos. Many people have complain about heating isue.Lets come to me perception , people who r saying its getting heated up during 1st boot& setting up the phone for the 1st time. i guess they haven't use any smart phone either. Its obvious while booting for the 1st time any phone will get heated up. Because all the applications will be running along with WIFI with highest performing speed to update apps UI, screen will be light-up for long time. Charging for 1st time may heat up a bit. leave the phone to get fully charged. use it for a day or 2. Turn off the 4G LTE, always use GSM for better call connectivity and a great battery life. . Turn on for G when it requires. i bet , you are not going to face heating issue . At least i am not facing any heating issue.
0|5|Pros. 1. Excellent Camera 2. Amazing Display 3. Sleek Design 4. Smooth Performance 5. Battery Last longer Cons. 1. UI7 is a lil confusing. 2. Switching between Performance mode and normal mode is something I dont like.
0|2|This handset overall performance is good. But, over heat produced during browsing and above 5 minutes calls.
0|1|This phone is very worst. Very heating option like message themes unabe to change no worth to buy price also not worth. all mi useless phone dont buy mi4i
0|3|Purchased phone 2 month ago and since last few days phone not charging. Issue in charging socket in the phone.
0|5|Bought this device for my Dad and believe me it is one of the best devices available in the market in that price range. Very smooth User interface, seamless functioning with 2 GB RAM and a crisp display Would recommend buying this product if you are in the market for a phone which is a top runner in 12k to 16k budget.
0|4|The phone in its own way is great but the ui eats up around 1 gb of your ram leaving you with only 1 gb. And thus it lags a little when used a little too extensively. And it does feel a phone with only 1gb ram in it. Overall the screen quality, battery life and the ui is great. (For those who want an app drawer just install the google launcher).
0|5|1.feels great 2.awesome performance 3.doesnot heatup so much as reviwed by many 4.no expandable memory is a haedache.
0|5|I was losing interest in Androids and was looking forward to buy an iPhone 6, but after going through the reviews I felt of giving Mi4i a shot. And I think it is one of the best decision I have made in my life. Save me a lot of bucks and with the new miui 7 upgrade its super smooth and it has brought my lost love for androids back. Mark my words Xiaomi is going to kill Apple in years to come. What quality. Pros 1) The best feature is the screen, iPhone or any other Smartphones can't match the quality, it's out of the world. 2) The 13 MP Camera is outstanding, we get rich colours with great accuracy. 3) The interface is buttery smooth and I am in love with it. Any iOS migrant would love it. 4) The gaming performance is extremely smooth. Cons None...But if they could provide a Screen Protector in the box it would've been even more awesome. Go for it Strongly recommended !!!
0|5|I was a bit hesitant to try out Xiaomi in the first place. Finally took the plunge and never regretted the decision. Mi4i gives amazingly snappy performance at a price which is hitherto unbeaten. One of the best displays in the sub 20K category and really practical MiUI complement the phone.
0|5|This is one of the best phones at this price. The quality does not seems compromised at all. Excellent job by miui in developing the software and keeping it upgraded.. Great Day camera. May give poor quality at night. Good Backup for battery. Buy Buy Buy..
0|5|I really nice phone, I must say. If this is one of your options buy this. TRUST ME it has a great value for money. It seems a bit expensive but its features deserve a much higher price CAMERA An extraordinary camera, Really appreciable both front and back cameras BATTERY Very long lasting battery. If not used extensively for gaming a lot it lasts 3/4 of a day DISPLAY Brilliantly rich and beautiful display HEATING ISSUES A bit heating is there while gaming but it is undetectable I have installed may apps till now but does never hangs
1|1|I have been using this phone for past three four months : following are the conclusions Pros: good camera cons heating battery backup not as per 3100 mah battery many bugs so always there is a need for update low memory backup up can not be taken even the pc suite available on mi official site does not solve problems i have loaded it on two pc one with windows xp and other windows 10 but in both cases backup can not be taken. the most important factor is that the projections which mi people gave initially that the best services will be given, initially they were very prompt but now the scene is entirely different you have to try at least hundred times to connect to the toll free number , on mail you will never get a reply, at service center you have to wait for at least two hours for turn. i have visited service center at chandigarh they are fully non cooperative and the infrastructure is poor ie ac not working, sitting space not proper you have to wait standing. it seems mi is not much interested in indian market now.
0|1|Here MI4i come with 2gb RAM , but i open my phone 1st time and no other application i have install. but only 1gb RAM its showing at startup the phone, so other 1gb RAM where it use. System memory showing 16Gb, but only 10GB available for users. SO its making us fool. and Camera clearity is also law. No other extra ordinary features inbuild in phone.
0|1|Simple waste of money. better pay couple of thousands extra to buy any Samsung or HTC. Cons: 1. Heating while using camera or browsing 2. Volume is too low 3. Screen is too weak , good if u keep it in showcase. 5200 bucks just to change the screen, a nightmare for me. Will never ever buy these Chinese phones again.
0|1|Mi4i is worst mobile phone i ever had used. It keeps on opening new windows automatically and keeps on hanging. It automatically forces the application to shut down or stop working. And this happens even with applications like Whatsapp and facebook. The google services are pathetic to use. They are never working. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOBILE PHONE RATING: NEGATIVE
0|4|some time it download update but when u install it at 99% it failed......... and some time slow performance . other wish it a nice phone .
0|5|After 2 months of extensive use (Gaming, Surfing, Calling, Chatting, FBing) i must say the phone is fast, responsive and Uber cool Yes, there were some heating issues at the start, after some 800MB updates the phone is performing well. No more heating issues. The MIUI is a nice thing. Inbuilt Anti-Virus and app optimization tool. Inbuilt bar-code scanner. Inbuilt call recorder. Double tap on screen the screen unlocks. Smart flip cover unlock mode for faster unlocking experience. The MIUI browser is cool and faster than chrome browser. The Screen is anti-scratch and bright (No Scratch without a screen guard till date) Auto Phone switch off and switch off mode... All-in-all a good phone with features of a 20K mobile My advise, buy the phone without the second thought.
1|1|one liner I would say.. Please dont by this piece of slowest process device. Invest 12K somewhere or just buy any other available mobile bt not this one.
0|4|Pros: Nice interface, Cool display, nice Front Camera (Better for Selfies) and you can play any games with this device. Cons: Back Camera fails to deliver 13MP, it is somewhat like 8 MP, even my previous micromax Canvas HD delivers much more clearer pics with 8MP. But At this price - you can go for it.
1|5|very good product . delivered on time and with the good quality. its came without headphone thats the only draw back
0|3|The phone is pretty good, but owing to 2 main issues that we faced, we had to return the handset. The phone heats up pretty bad while charging. Its like a stove, and probably I can cook myself an omlet on it. The second issue faced is that, encrypted emails cannot be configured on the phone. Thankfully, Flipkart acknowledged the issue and refunded the money. Or else, I would have had a mini stove in the bedroom.
0|1|waste of money no worth it cheap finishing ashamed of lotto not that good not comfortable worse seller
1|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! > Camera stopped working on the very first day. i am not sure if you guys will believe me or not but the camera stopped working on the very first day i got this phone. I thought its a bug in the OS and updated the phone to the latest OTA update, even after that the camera didnt start however it degraded the over all performance of this phone and yes guys it all happened the very first day of use > Heats like hell: | don,t buy until your hands are heat resistant. it heats concernedly even if you just browse through your settings or use the camera.. I can even feel the heat even when its in my pocket doing nothing. > I didn't tried banging this phone against the wall it might work just fine after that Only 2 issues everything else works fine i have already returned this phone and might get a new 1 but I WANT MY MONEY BACK
1|1|I have been using Mi 4i for past 2 and 1/2 months. In the beginning, the phone worked fine. But one day, all of sudden, the phone stopped charging. I went to the Mi service centre and they told me that it will take 45 days to repair the phone. I am really unhappy with the product and its service. Xiaomi has not made this product durable. I do not recommend this product to any one. Please don't by it.
0|4|This is a wonderful gadget at an affordable price. It had slight heating issues, but after the recent software upgrade, things seem to be fine.
0|1|Phone was delivered within time frame and well packed, however it start getting little more warm..initially then after one month screen display was not proper green lines were coming on edges, also while using maps phone was getting excessive heat up (i can not hold in hands, fear of blasting) when i brought it to pune exclusive service center, Xiomi people told user has damage the screen reason given as inside screen crack, so can not be covered in warranty , but i had placed hard glass and cover too there was no mark outside for damage or fallen still they gave reason you might have sit on phone so it is damage, it was n use to arguing with service centre people theu don't listen. PLEASE DO NOT BUY MI phone. my money and time are wasted to vist far away centre and off course on phone too.
1|4|Everything is fine but its hanging some times ..battery back up is awesome..Heating when we are playing games and using 3G..i dont know that its not memory expandable ..
0|1|my xiaomi mi fan hall so mi4i mobile heat issues. only 35 days used No games, no web surfing still heating in call attemt ear in heating and smell in mi4i my update miui7.
0|2|its good phone. But needs to work on some bugs, otherwise its irritating a lot. Camera clarity is good.
1|1|hello please becarefull before taking mi4i, we can enjoy internet browsing continously when it connected with wifi, if we are using mobile operator network for internet, then there is a lot of internet disconnectivity problem.
1|5|The Phone is very good, but the problem is that it gets heated up too much. Expect the MI team do the needful.
0|4|The Phone quality and Camera is best to compare with moto G series, and cloud sync service saved my photos from accidental delete, As average users i recommend this phone is outstanding phone in budget but with MiUi i found the Pure Android experience is still missing for example Google Now the reminder and voice assistance function is not work proper as expected from android however there is no alternative available for MiUi and i have my moto 360 found compatible issues to sync notifications and voice control with this device, but u want to control applications and behaviour i recommended this Mi4I as the mobile encharge security functionality with MiUi as no other android base OS gives you. and Voice quality, Battery life, camera clearity over all gives 4 star only compatibility with pure android function 1 start is missing.
0|1|i used only 4 5 days its like a heater tooo hot am sitting in full chilled ac room but only am listening songs then the phone start heating & sound is tooo low so dont go
1|2|Hey peps, I have been using a moto G(1st Gen) phone over a year.I bought a brand new mi 4i from store (time to upgrade i thought ;) ) . FIrst of all talking about the pros: 1. The display on this device is gorgeous!! its the best in class display you could get. Colour reproduction is great. 2. The design is supercool.its sleek,stylish and if you want improve its looks u can pair it up with back covers. I personally liked the grey version. 3. As a first time user of miui i am becoming a fan of it . highly customizable. 4. The camera on this device is exceptional. the selfie cam comes with a beautification mode which really works!! Now coming to the cons: I already heard of the well acknowledged heating issue of the device. As I am not a gamer i thought its not gonna affect me But still dont ever think of multitasking on this device. I was unable to simultaneously use mobile data/wifi during phone calls as the device will be superhot. As we all know the issue is with a snapdragon 615 2nd Gen chipset. I donno whether this issue will be fixed or not. I thought like returning the device but I was in love with this beauty. So if u are an average user like me, just think twice before you buy this device or wait for the conformation that the issue is fixed
0|4|Best in class specs, Great display, Decent battery life, Good Call Quality, Speaker volume is decent - i wish they would have got them on the rim but that does not kill the deal. Overall a very good phone in that price range.
1|4|alright so i have been using this phone for the past two months ....and am having mixed feelings il start with the pros 1.5" hd display(clear and crystal clarity) 2.camera is just awesome....can take gr8 macro shots...one of the best features of the phone.but when compared to camera...video seems blurry ..but still good 3.inbuilt security and cleaner ...so u dont have to install 3rd party softwares 4.the 8 core cpu is promising,...no lags while playing the highest graphical games(ashpalt 8,mortal combat x,modern combat 3.....) 5.miui 6( upgrade to miui 7 devloper rom is available rom...global one is not available as of now) 6.as of now i am using the latest miui 6.7.2.0 7.cool feautres such as double tap to awake,prevent pocket dialing...inbuilt app locker and permission manager(in case you dont feel safe with the permissions given to each app) 8.customizable led notification 9.a lot of downloadble themes form mi theme market CONS 1.even though there is 2gb ram ..miui takes up a lot around 900-1000 mb availble to the user 2.the processor is a iron box ....it heats up whenver u use high load apps...or jus simple clash of clans+wifi..m talking around 55 celcius...even though it wont damge your phone ..its still disturbing(i tried flashing thermal restricting mods...didnt seem to have any change) 3.the battery....with every update the battery's life varies (mi provide updates every month till now)...as of now while using miui 6.7.2.0 the battery lasts if dont use the phone .if u watch videos online it wont drain much(but wifi+games=MUCH DRAIN M TALKING 10% in 15 minutes) 4.experiencing call drops after 6.6.6.0 updates 5.only 11.30gb available out of 16 as of now the cynogen mod is under development stage ...so havent tried it yet .... once the stable miui 7 is released il write an update on heating and battery if i were you id stick away from this phone as of now....mi4c will be released in sep ....a better version of the mi4i.
1|5|i am using this phone from 4 months . don't face any problem while using it. it never hangs. have nice battery backup. good display quality.
1|5|I brought it for my spouse. She liked it due to its size and camera quality. There is no heating problem for this phone. Battery back up is really recommendable.
0|3|Camera, interface, everything is good. But please beware of 2 major issues: 1. Internet 2g/3g doesnt function properly. Wifi connects fine. 2. Ring volume is too low.. yu wont hear it in a crowded place
0|5|After using this phone for 4 months: Pros: 1.camera quality too good. 2.sound good. 3.No lagging while playing games and multitasking. 4.2 GB ram enough. 5.3000 mah battery enough for whole day uses. 6.Sleek & stylish with good display even in low light. Cons: 1.No memory card slot. 2.Too many updates required by apps. 3. Sometimes Data connection changes automatically from sim-1 to sim-2 which can cost you a lot. 4. No earphone. Overall i love this phone.
0|5|Design and display The Xiaomi Mi 4i comes with a unibody design that lends it a very solid look and feel. It's built from high-quality polycarbonate which is atypical of devices at this price point. Colour reproduction and viewing angles on the Xiaomi Mi 4i are great. The display is bright enough for text and other on-screen elements to be easily visible under sunlight, though you may find yourself getting distracted by your reflection. The Mi 4i comes with what Xiaomi terms a Sunlight Display.What the Sunlight Display effectively does is brighten darker portions of an image when you are outdoors to make the details easily visible. Software and performance The Xiaomi Mi 4i comes with MIUI 6 running on top of Android 5.0.2. We've covered various aspects of the MIUI skin in depth in our previous Xiaomi reviews, though we'd like to reiterate some points and highlight certain elements. To say that MIUI is RAM hungry would be an understatement, and we've come across Xiaomi devices in the past where there wasn't enough memory available for end-user applications. Thankfully, the Mi 4i comes with 2GB RAM, a little less than half of which is available to applications when you boot up the device. One feature that Xiaomi touted during the Mi 4i launch event is Visual IVR. The company is using crowdsourced data to map IVR menus of commonly used numbers such as India Railways, Vodafone, Cleartrip, and others to build a visual tree of their IVR menus. So, for example, if you call Indian Railways, you will be presented with options like '1 for English, 2 for Hindi..' on screen, and you don't need to wait to hear the entire menu read out to you before selecting your choice. You can simply select the option by tapping it on screen, and you'll be instantly shown all options at the next level, and so on. Camera and battery life The Xiaomi Mi 4i comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera that captures great detail outdoors and in extremely well-lit conditions. HDR mode performs well. The dual-tone LED flash does a good job of lighting up subjects evenly. Videos captured by the rear camera look decent, though colour reproduction is slightly off here as well. The in-built mic does a good job of capturing clear audio. The Xiaomi Mi 4i has a 3000mAh battery that the company claims is designed to give one-and-a-half days of usage in typical conditions. Our real life experience was a little underwhelming in comparison. While the smartphone easily lasted an entire day, we were down to sucking the last bits of juice out of the battery by the next morning. Good=> Stunning display Great build quality Bad=> MIUI has its quirks Camera performance could be better
0|2|basically phone is good but over heating and network problems. some game is not operate and play..
1|2|I personally used this phone. Found one big defect that whenever we reboot this MI4i phone, one process "com.google.process.gapps" stops. I checked this three times, always it happens. one more thing about this phone that it goes on hang if you are using internet.
0|4|This mobile is awesome. You can buy it without worries. There is no any negative points in this mobile. only 16 GB fixed is may be cause for some users. But 16 GB is more than enough. Go for it. Camera is superb man.
0|1|i have been using this fon for abt 3 months now. this fon just hangs alot, especially when u use wifi,charge,surfing. It just freezes and restarts abruptly.
0|4|Phone is good but MIUI still needs improvements in Memory management, games sometime experience lags due to the same. Camera is ok and not great. Sunlight display was too hyped up. But, display is pretty good, great form factor, and pretty light and thin. No heating issues.
1|1|From the day 1 I am experiencing some understated unexpected problems: - Keep hanging on regular intervals - Problems in surfing Internet. - Sharp edges - Bar buttons (main three buttons at bottom) are not working properly and keep hanging. I will never recommend anybody to buy this handset.
0|5|Bit of heating problem else i like it all. Pros Slim Good battery wonderful display good camera nice touch good security options Cons heating less sound non removable battery
0|5|Very Nice Phone , early Delivery , happy with this product, this phone camera is better then any phone. if your budget is more then please buy this phone only
1|4|The phone is unbelievably slim and light, and feels very classy. The features it packs are not only excellent, but unbelievable for this price. It is almost like an iphone in its operations, and is at the same time, somewhat MORE user-friendly. A great buy. Internal memory is quite good, battery life is fabulous, and it does not take ages to recharge. Cons: 1. While the camera has very good resolution, image quality is inferior to a similar resolution camera on an iphone. 2. The sleek design makes the phone slippery. If it falls down and the screen is broken, you are in a soup (IT HAPPENED TO ME). The glass and the LCD screen are coupled, so a crack on the glass made my LCD screen inoperative. It had to be replaced (It cost me Rs 4500, while the phone itself was 12999) by the authorized service provider, but it took over three weeks for them to get a replacement screen. Mi accessories are hard to get. 3. The manual is badly written or not available in English. My advice is: You must buy a screen guard with this phone, which is otherwise, an excellent product of chinese craftsmanship at this cost. The quality is really good, despite the above-mentioned problems.
0|3|Plus points:Looks Great, good speed, Superb Camera, Great features like call record, recorder, scanner,compass etc Yet to use many other features.(using for last 1 month) Minus points: Battery heating & general heating is there more or less. Loud speaker fails after 3 seconds while listening to calls or music and volume diminishes after 5 seconds of any incoming calls.No service centre to address these issues.
0|4|Camera quality is too good and this phone is worth for its price...Except for the battery life , I love this phone a lot..
1|1|am purchased last month 3-8-2015, now the phone in not working phone sound automatically decreased. so please don't buy xiaomi product friends
0|3|I have been using this product but performance is not good. It hangs regularly even after I clear the memory / cpu of process running. Camera takes long time to focus. Mi3 was far better product. One design flow is speaker on back side , not at bottom. This causes ring not to be heard , when phone is on bed/sofa etc.
0|2|The phone is too slow responsive. OS has so many flaws. Some apps are not compatiable with OS. And also the processor is not that responsive. It's slower.
0|3|Positive :- Display quality is good Camera quality is good. Battery life is average. -Negative :- It hangs frequently Not worth for 14K. Sound quality is poor. Deliverable time from Flipkart was excellent. Unnecessary preloaded software which kills the ram and battery life. It's just an average phone.
0|4|I have been using this phone for 3 months now. Loved it , recommended it to my friends, even they loved it, But yesterday I got an issue with the phone,, the camera has a black patch in the rear camera Given it for service, Lets hope they give me a new phone.
0|4|I am using this MI4I phone from last 3 months. I think this is sufficient time to understand completely to judge the phone performance. Pros: 1. The performance of the phone is too good. 2. I never seen hanging problem so far for this phone 3. Video recording HD quality is too good 4. Very flexible to handle this phone in single hand as it is 5 inches 5. Battery backup is good. But when internet connected the backup is down. Cons: Prise can be reduced as when compared with other company similar mobiles
0|5|good enough. Don't get demotivated by the negative comments. Yes the phone gets slightly heaten but it will not interrupt you any way.
0|4|...the company has done well with the product, the only issue lack of additional storage capacity and unavailability of 32GB or more model
0|1|This product has got a very good Front and rear Camera. It has got good performance. But it is having heating issues when using 3G/4G Internet and it is hanging once a day.
0|5|Bought it in May. performing like a charm. Only issue is of heating up while charging. Otherwise it is best phone in this price range. I would say value for money.
0|1|Pros: very good specs at this price range sucessfully withstands few drops with minor damage decent camera Good service network Cons: Many xiomi phones have died with minor water splash ( may be due to its design even a single drop of water thro the ports finds it way to the critical components) Spares are too costly
0|3|THERE IS A LOT OF HEATING PROBLEM IN THIS SET ALTHOUGH OVERALL FEATURES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE MODEL I'VE USED TILL DATE.
0|4|nice phone good themes ...heats more compared to other phones..spec is good for this price...some apps have issues while loading
0|5|good one .. buy in jan buying one more!!
0|5|GOOD SPEEDY DILEVERY
0|4|Heating Issue Battery Drains quickly after installation of More apps. Camera and 4K Video recording Top Notch
1|2|The phone doesn't allow incoming calls when the internet preference setting is in LTE mode (4G). When I make a call to someone, and finish my conversation with them, and immediately if someone else makes a call to me, I'm able to get the incoming call and also answer them. But after 5 minutes, if anybody calls me, "the subscriber has switched off the mobile phone or can't be reached at this moment, please call after sometimes" is what the caller receives at their end. When the setting is set to 3G mode, the phone is fine. I thought it to be a defect in the Sim card or maybe with Airtel network issues, So I had put my sim card into my tablet which is also 4G. It worked fine. Incoming calls happens. Again I switched the sim card to my brand new Mi 4i, the phone doesn't pick incoming call signals. I called Xiomi customer care. They asked me to restore factory settings. I did just that and started fresh with my phone again. The problem persists. I have requested a replacement. Fingers crossed.
0|4|Very good product except camera pixel resolution. It is not actual 13 mp cam. but color and other options are great. Low light photography without flash is too grainy. Other than this, it is a great product. Also try to buy 32 GB version since 16 GB is not enough to store videos. Great display, great responsive touch and no heating issue after software update.Sound is also loud and clear. Good battery back up. Good phone!!
1|2|It is not showing the correct memory size remaining .It is showing more memory when opened and seen through About Phone and when opened through Explorer it is showing less memory.And the tough experience is showing lag and not responding correctly some times.As Expected Heating is also a Problem.
1|5|Though most reviews read that the phone gets overheated but after updating to latest ROM through system update, the heating problem is gone to large extent. But still a good phone with good display, good battery backup and average camera (not so good in low light condition).
1|2|i purchased this phone from 3 months ago... I totally disappointed while using this smart phone cuz I'm a gamer... I can't play asphalt8 in high graphics.. And other high graphics game also.... there is lots of lag... ..... In all video they show Mi4i can play asphalt8 in high graphics.. . I also checked the performance mode..... But failed... Don't know what to do.. ... Tomorrow i will go to xiaomi service center...... .
0|4|This phone is simply value for money. it has got 615 snapdragon 64 bit SoC which works smooth with the octacores. no lag as such with games like asphalt. camera is grt too but low light photos tend to get blurred at the edges. perfect photos in ambient light and the HDR works quite efficiently. In all it is a value for money gadget.
0|4|great processor , great camera and you can even see the screen properly in high sunlight ... and great great great video quality ,, I dont think any other phone can match the HD video quality
1|5|it good phone that we got from this rate..but the main prblm was lack of memmory or no slot for sd card
1|4|The phone looks very good and it didn't get hot till now.It has been more than 1 month since I have brought it. The overall perfomance is good. A problem that I have noticed is that the speaker perfomance is not very good,but it is not that bad too.The phone does not support music format other than mp3.The battery backup is good and the display is superb.Camera is superb except for its low light perfomance,but its also not that bad.The phone looks very good than many of the high budget phones I have seen.
0|5|The phone is great and an amazing one. but u may suffer the heating problem some times. hopes which will get solved
0|5|It is a fantastic phone. 1) No lags works perfectly 2) Battery backup is better than any other phone. NO HEATING ISSUE AT ALL! AFTER YOU UPDATE THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE! Stay CALM AND GO FOR IT.
0|5|I have been using this product for three month. First of all I would like to inform aout my uses, I am a guy involved in marketing of petroleum product, and my work is about lot of calling normally I dont get time for gaming or any other heavy phone use for my use I found MI perfect Pros 1)Great for calling and receiving call 2)Battery is unbelievable for a smartphone(Need not to carry any Backup) 3)Great User Interface and Multitasking, True that MIUI eats up more than 1 GB RAM but other apps run without any problem, so basically it dosent matter also MIUI is much more user friendly and easy for calling and messaging much better than stock android( You can send 100 text msg in one go great for me) 4)display is great works well in sunlight 5)Camera is good I use it mainly for official purpose does its job perfectly front cam is always a delight, with that even people like me are forced to take selfy 6)feels great in hand, i have met many people using MI phones and everyone is happy great build quality and sufficiently tough for rough use(I dont use any backcover or even screengaurd) Cons 1)Heating problem heard a lot about it I would say it is not the coolest phone but heating is well within limit and absolutely no point for which such a phone should be droped almost all smartphones gets heated up 2) Limited storage well this may be dealbreake for many but now 32GB version is also available hope that solve the problem, my work is going fine but there is always a thought in your mind about storage
0|3|Battery Ok. But its getting hang often. once forthnightl(avg). Overall good. good camera. Nice look. I am not playing much games but whenever I used it never got too hot so. good.
1|2|i think mi4 is a better bet than 4i even though 4i was launched later, it still doesnt perform as nicely as 4. with just few thousands more, I would suggest people to buy Mi 4 instead. Even in terms od looks 4 looks far better... 4i has not so sturdy plastic body and if it falls you can imagine what would happen
0|3|very good product but it not able to play 4k video and not support headphone and ear phone and also home theater pin.
1|2|I thouht this phone is superior than any other brands because the manufacturer given this feeling in our minds but when I used this phone I thought I was mis-guided.
1|1|Sound quality very poor, slippery back cover.not at all recommended. Camera is not teh quality which a 13 px should have.
0|3|can i read hindi language.your language feature not showing proper because it is china made so please show all sapporting language
0|5|The phone is simply superb, very sharp and great display, the cameras are superb too. Very happy for having ordered it. The Delivery was great too!!!
0|1|having a software issue and battery problem not satisfied with this product. Pls do not buy it...........................................
0|1|As per the details given Batt of 3200 MH is not working like that, Signal issue of data and mobile both, a 2 GB ram and 1.7 Ghz ph is getting hang, the hight is nobody is ready to take call on the same, i have done several complain but no resolution. Flipkart is just making fool of customers.
0|5|beauty at its best. its a android version of apple. software is best. best camera, best processor. quality of camera is like any digicam. best buy in this range. should buy it.
1|1|Its waste of buying Mi4i Phone. First we faced the problem with the handset and replaced with new one and again we are facing the problem with second one. When we take the vide o and send it through whatsapp getting green line on the video. When we are talking phone getting heated after one minute. Please don't buy the this phone. This is my sincere advise to all of you.
1|5|Dear friends, this phone is good in all cases ,,. the only disappoint is that it does not have amemory card slot...... overall phone is good.....i am loving it..
1|5|Am really impressed with this mobile. I purchased this after lot of research. Screen quality is very good and you can customize UI with themes and different Launchers. Camera is doing good. but in dim light, it is not that much clear. I think that's ok for this price range. Call quality is also good and I didn't see any issue with cellular network access. finally, I am getting little bit heat when you use camera for long time. I am not a hardcore gamer so, I con't tell how heavy games work in this. overall I am happy with this phone and Flipkart delivery.
1|1|touch doesn't work properly on the right side of screen...from the very first day. can't talk with phone touching ears or face--gets hot can't get piston earphone..always out of stock..
0|5|This is a very nice piece and recommended for everyone looking for speed. I am amazed by its processing speed and photo clarity.
0|5|Everything for this mobile is good apart from unavailability of micro SD card slot. Company could increase the capacity of front camera also in-order to woo the customers. On my perspective it is kind of OK phone.
0|4|By roughly i mean the way you used your last samsung galaxy or some other phone(like it would fall around 3 to 4 times a day.. n would still work).. on the other hand, this phone is a quite delicate one.. you've to handle with care.. screen is quite delicate(even though it's gorilla 3 or something).. otherwise, it is a good one.. best camera.. best resolution, no such heating effect, perfect size and overall go for it.. if you can handle with care.. for rough users.. i would not recommend this !
0|5|I love this phone..responsive screen..great camera also..screen is fantastic..loads of theams to customise your phone's appearence. Wonderful master piece
1|1|Mi4i is the worst ever mobile till date. 1)With every miui updates there arises a new problem. 2)There is call drop issue with this phone which can't be sorted out as the miui developer are inefficient 3)The Mi customer service is pathetic. They don't attend your calls. ****Please keep in mind all these points before buying this phone.*******
0|4|This phone is good its camera quality is too good and its so light and slim phone if i compare with other phone in same feature than it is cost is worst Battery so heat during listen song and play game with in 1/2 hour there four i m giving four star one star less due to battery heatup Thanks Redmi phone last 1/2 month experience
0|1|PROBLEM FACEED BY ME. 1. BACK KEY NOT WORKING. (OTHER CHARGER ALSO USED FOR CHARGE ) 2. WHEN WE GOING FOR CAHRGING IT WHEN CHARGER ARE PLUG IN THE MOBILE IT AUTOMATICALLY SWITCH OFF. 3. IN A DAY MORE THEN 4-5 TIME WHEN CALL IN COMING IT HANGUP. 4.CAMERA NOT WORKING HANG AFTER MORE THEN 3-4 CLICK.
0|5|This is a best Mobile Phone in range of 10-30K. Best features. 1. Best Camera Quality 2. Fast processing speed 3. Best Display 4. Sound quality is Good 5. Look and feel is Awesome... No one can beat this Phone...
0|1|I had purchased mi4i mobile 2months ago. I have frequently facing the call drop issue. I had take all the latest updates on (8th Sep 2015) after that still facing this issue.
1|4|Pros Camera Quality- Very Good Display Quality - Very Good Speed and Peformance - very Good. No Lags in any operations. I could even play Asphalt car game on tv using chromecast. Worked well. Very Slim and Lightweight. You will feel uncomfortable using other phones after you get used to this one. Cons Heating Problem- There was extreme heating problem. But it is now completely fixed within 2 weeks of launch. FYI , I bought this phone in first lot in Flipkart Sale.
0|4|I am writing this review after using this mobile for more than 4 months now. First things first, if you love to click pics, then just buy this mobile. The daylight picture quality is just awesome. Night pictures gets jagged, but if there is sufficient light, the night pictures too would come pretty good. I have clicked pictures with back lights of two wheeler on mountain top, and the pictures were the best among all the mobiles which we had(and it included the Samsung S4 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3). Looks wise too this mobile is sleek and sexy. I have a white one, and it really looks classy. The UI works good and sometimes lags, but its not something which can cause you frustration. After all its not a Samsung S5 or S6 or iPhone. Don't expect that kind of performance, but overall it works pretty good. The only downside is the memory of 16GB which is NOT EXPANDABLE. So, I am kind of skeptical, when would it run out. As of now, it is pretty empty and if you do the cleanup on regular basis, you should be good. Also, I am not a big gaming or application fan, so I only install apps which I really need and don't update them unless it is extremely important. :-P For a person who is coming from a basic Android experience(like Micromax or Karbonn), MiUi might be a difficult thing to grasp at first. But, once you get a hang of it, its pretty cool and intuitive. Best features of the phone - FTP Server to transfer files from mobile to desktop and vice-versa on same Wifi without any cable - In build utilities to clean, scan and do other maintenance for which you install several apps and really don't know whether they do what they promise. Plus these are ad free. - One handed mode which converts the display to 4 inch or 3.5 inch so that you can use the mobile with just one hand Overall, if you are looking a very good mobile in 10-15K range, this is the standout among them all by far.
1|1|touch screen malfunctioning...some area of touch screen not responding...heating so much...battery also drainning fast...miui has lots of bug ,apps are automatically opening...
0|3|in the beginning I wasn't happy as there are many things which we expect to be there in product description. like battery is non removable. it heats up when flash is used for some time. it would have been better if expandable memory is provided.Sound is too low. its a full hd handset, on this point it gets 100%. very good display as well as camera is too good. on that part I am happy. battery backup is ok.
0|1|this phone under performs on all fronts. Battery sucks. speaker sucks. phone lags a lot even on basic applications. heats like stove. MIUI is over hyped, seriously it sucks too. Body made of plastic looks like cheap china phone. No resale value. having a big RAM and Processor does not guarantee a good phone and MI 4I is the perfect example of it the only good thing was the camera but what is the use when the phone hangs.
1|1|i like this mobile Easy to read, easy on the eyes A quick edit and spell check will work wonders for your credibility. Also, break reviews into small, digestible paragraphs.
0|5|Real worth for the money. Tough to get this kind of features for this price.. PROs : 1. Brilliant display 2. Good speed and processing capability 3. Great camera quality 4. Slim and weightless build 5. good aesthetics CONs: 1. UI consumes a slightly high amount of RAM 2. No external memory card slot available ( if 12 GB is insufficient) Battery is pretty good, would be considered a neutral attribute. But on the whole, a great phone to have at this price..
1|4|Good performance and battery backup. Never hang and take no time to load even big files. Camera quality is mind-blowing both front and back.
0|5|EXCELLENT PHONE GOOD DISPLAY AWESOME PERFORMANCE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT BUILD QUALITY AWESOME I AM LOVING IT.
1|1|I have already carried it to service center 3 times for 3 different issues. In Every other phones you can do 1 thing if there is any problem, you switch off the phone and after rebooting your problem is solved itself. but in this phone that is not an option. My 3 issues were 1. Earphone logo appeared even there is no earphone connected to it 2. Front Camera option Just got vanished. No sign of it. 3. No sim card detected even there is two Sim cards appropriately inserted. And Dont expect a lavishing experience in service centers.Worst Service centers everywhere. They dont even have their own Service Centers. My Recommendation Dont Go for it.
0|1|The screen glass is very weakest one. It is breaking, Even if you press while you play game. For me, it just broken within 1 month, when I was using. Could not believe. I do not want to spend further money to fix, since there is no guarantee that the life time. Either I’m going to through this or give to my known circle as free. I had heating issues too. Poor service centers and its operations in India My opinion: Do not buy this Mi4i phone. You may need to change frequently the display. You could have been bought even IPhone instead of this. Because display is such a high price and unavailability.
0|4|Writing this review after 2 months of usage. Previously I was using Moto E and I was feeling a bit uncomfortable while switching to Mi4i as I felt very comfortable with stock android. But MIUI is way cleverly designed and its way more easy to use then stock android, though it got bugs but the developers are working hard to make the experience more pleasurable. Other than that the phone heats up alot but to my utter surprise the phone never crashed or dysfunction. It sometimes lag though not too much but as I said the experience is constantly improving because of continuous supply of system updates. Battery lasts whole day though i'm not a very heavy user. Camera is fantastic no doubt about that.
0|1|I liked the phone until i used it heavily. MIUI is great. i will miss it. but i have to move on. the phone sucks at multitasking. when doing heavy operation. it lags to the core. when i am driving with google navigation on . it taks forever to switch to other apps. i removed temperature control ( with performance mode on) still the problem persists. I guess the 2 gb ram is not enough. udpated to all latest miui software still the phone lags and sucks at multitasking and heavy usage. sad to let it go.. going to welcome one plus two or asus zenfone 2 ( 4 gb ram is the priority)
0|3|It is just 4 months of my XIAOMI MI4I & I have started Facing issues like Sudden Restart, Battery Reducing at Faster level, Also there is a serious problem, after 1 min of Call I am not able to hear the Voice,the call being active, after like 30 Seconds i get to hear the voice, this happens continously at time intervals. Voice Hearing Problems faced in almost all calls. Also I am not sure who Can help me regarding the same.
0|2|Good look but miui has to much software bugs sometimes updating the phone may be harmful to phone specially front camera(BLURR IMAGES). sometimes miss call shows rejected though you don't do so.
1|5|Fantastic display, Phone Never hangs, Good Battery life, fast charging. Only issue i feel is the lack of external Memory card slot. Best phone at this price..
0|5|I have been using this phone for 3 months now. Its sleek and stylish and absolutely fantastic. I didnt face any issues including the most common heating complaint. Love the phone!
0|1|Worst phone I have ever come across it starts heating up to fast also the sound quality of Mi4i is not so good I think MI needs to fix this problem as it is the common complaint of most of the users better prefer branded phone just dnt go for looks see the features as well.
0|1|I have purchased mi 4i last month . and now find that it get heated when I use internet through Wi-Fi and then some times it disconnect the connection after half an hour wi fi uses, This problem really shock me. Even in the normal net surfing heating is extremely high. also internal memory of 16GB is not sufficient if some one want to make HD vedio.
1|1|After I faced some problem with front camera of my under warranty phone, I submitted it to authorized service center. After diagnosis, they told me that my phone requires motherboard change, after chasing customer care for 2 months I got back my phone…. Amazingly untouched, unattended, without repair. Even I wrote two mails to the customer care but they don’t bother to reply or acknowledgement. Now I don’t have courage to go back to the Xiaomi service center after all this episode. My advice, buy this beauty at your own risk ….Customer care and service center sucks.
0|4|Look Great look and feel Camera Good camera and great front camera Performance Good performance Bad- Poor sound Heating Without earphone Overall very good phone
0|3|Its an amazing phone, since i bought it got not a single problem . .
0|1|I have bought this phone before 4 month.... Look wise good but functionally issue found Phone Hang and Battery drain very fast and also Hand-free not provided by Xioami... multitasking features also not available in this range .... Finally I give only 1 star... If possible for change ...I do...
0|5|For this price food mobile. feels like Iphone 6 .. But only one problem is no extendable memory.. 16GB is very less.
0|4|Good front and back camera. Battery stays for one and half day with average usage which is better than most smartphones in the market. Cons- Not really scratch resistance. A gorilla glass would have been much better. Battery heats on heavy usage. Should you buy this phone - at the price of 12K, MI 4i is far better than other phones. My advice - Just go for it.
0|2|After 4 months of use- Battery- lasts for 7 hours for normal use. Display- Good Sound- Not loud Notification lights- Stopped working Heating- Started few days back Apart from these- 1. No notification on charging. 2. Phone hangs if not rebooted, and it hangs up during reboot. 3. Loudspeaker sound is low. 4. Miscall notification has some bug, need to check call log every time.
0|5|Amazing camera with wide angle selfie. Pictures taken are quite brilliant with lot of details. Good interface, to simply put Iphone interface bundled in Andriod OS. Nice sleek built to hold. Premium finish and stylish to carry. Far better than any other brand in this price segment with the given features.
1|5|Bold and Beautiful. I am using this since its first sale. No problem till date except the speaker sound is very slow to hear music. When using headphone it is ok.
0|3|i bought this in may 2015.As i heard it earlier it has heating problem with camera and on charging.Battery life is okay.Recently it has got a break at home button of just it has fallen from two feet from a chair.This indicates the cheap manufacturing from xiaomi.I used htc one x for 4 years not even a scratch occured .but for xiaomi of two feet height it s broken .Service centre people are telling no warranty .no proper response from xiaomiservice.this is too bad.
1|1|no delivary in etawah its sucks evrytime do something that we can enjoys shoping here even most of the time i want to buy new stuffs but for this delivery issues of etawah city cant even buy those stuffss
0|2|Hi Friends, I am using Mi 4i from last one month from July 21. When i am in middle of Texting something from mobile and if i get some call or some how if i go to contacts/Logs page and if i try to click back button it brings me back to Message page and again if i click back it takes me to Contacts/Logs page. Even after multiple back cliks it behaves simliarly
1|1|This was my first Xiami phone and i am very disappointed with the performance. While the camera quality is good, the voice clarity and the software
0|4|The phone has a great display. It also has a splendid cam(both rear and front). It would be a great buy for people who are not performance freaks, although it performs well enough to play high end games. The heating issue is a bit of a concern(feels uneasy sometimes during calls), but overall, the phone is great buy. The best thing about the phone is its form factor(it doesn't look as bulky as other 5 inch phones and its really light)
1|4|Good but have to solve missed call bug...........................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1|1|i don't want this phone coz: 1) no external memory option 2) company lying about user memory is 12.77gb its only 9.8gb and that is also after updating otherwise its 9gb only 2) not removable battery 3) no earphones with this product 4) heating problem 5) sound quality is bad and very low please flipkart i don't want this "Mi4i" replace this with another company's mobile please call me
0|5|I got this phone one week ago used it and the quality is awesome in terms of display , battery back up,camera just a little heating issue while playing games with high graphics. Rest all things i will give full rating for this!!!
0|4|this mobile is excellent in this all features and good product there is no problems value for money good quality display and all its features
0|3|Pros- Amazing camera, good UI, Look and feel Cons- Heats up making it difficult to hold within 5 mins of normal usage. Sometimes even when you are not using the phone, it heats up, making it very difficult to manage- especially when you are driving.
0|5|it is a great phone.i have been using the phone for a while and have been pleased with the performance and features of the phone.the phone does heat up but it is not a deal-breaker.if you are searching for a great phone for a budget just go for it.
0|4|Compare to the previous MI4I , after the update this works very well.. Worth for money I bought 3 MI4I and suggesting to my friends also
0|5|This new beauty from Mi clearly signifies the standard of Mi...Hats off to you people....the storage is awesome , camera is one of the best ones, ram fairly good, battery ( works one day), its one of the best flagship smartphones today...but Mi needs to work on the Looks a lil' bit and also the heating up of the phone...in all it's a nyc buy...i will surely recommend this one...#peace
0|3|basically phone had just one disadvantage of low space in mi4i but with the new launch the phone is like the best product of all time
0|3|very good display,Camera. Speaker Output & ringer volume is very low, Heatup in case of data usage or long conversation for more than 5min...
0|5|I bought last mont & found it awesome in this class. Pics. quality super with long battery life. Call on Second SIM inform if u talk on first SIM. Very slim & weightless. Its value for money.
1|1|I am not a big fan of any smart phone, however bought this one considering the attractive features.However this phone doesn't have good camera, though it says 13 MP, but its very bad. Don't buy this phone. I wish, I had purchased something lesser priced smart phone with better camera.
0|4|I am a big fan of MI smartphones. Its one of the best smartphones I have ever used under 15k. Camera, display, touch, etc; all are unmatched. I will recommend this phone.
0|1|I was a MI fan since MI3 but MI4i is the worst phone till date. I have used phone for just few months and phone is completely dead. It wont boot up. Completely dissatisfied.
0|1|Not a great product from MI.The sound quality is very bad.The phone gets heated up. Bad connectivity for internet on phone data
0|1|Bought phone thinking this product will be best,but after using one month found several defects ,volume issue,blurred image,no accessories like headphone.. request avoid this phone for atleast 6 months until product stablize.
0|2|After roughly 1month of usage - Pros - - Fast - seamlessly navigate between the opened apps. No glitch at all. - Lots of space RAM for apps. - Cons - (latest software updates does not fix these existing serious issues) (based on - MIUI 6.6.10.0 (LXIMICF)- - I can not make or receive calls. - You can not see your contacts. It hangs and crashes the Phone dialer. - As everyone is saying, it heats during music playback and calling. - WhatsApp - take a bit of time to load. - Corporate Email hangs most of the time while downloading emails. In my opinion the software bugs need to be fixed. If it takes too much of time to fix these, I would prefer to wait for some more time before buying this product. As the mobile without a calling facility does not make any sense! :-( This is my 3rd Xiaomi mobile. I was little bit disappointed with the performance and Quality of this phone.
1|4|Nice product but heating will be more. Especially while charging, talking more than 20 minutes and using Internet.
0|4|I am using Mi4i since 2 months. For this prize range Mi4i is the best of all. Display and camera clearity is awesome even better than sony/samsung..one can compare this item with iphone. only drawback about this phone is memory and is not expandable, I would have given 5 strars if it is expandable. But overall Mi is the best
0|1|Flipkart online shoping is duper. They hide many terms and condition. missing earphone and Power bank is the product packet.
0|1|Bad Gaming Experience Even with MIUI7 5.8.22.UI lags even in Normal game play.This is just a Camara phone not for game lovers .
1|1|Total chaos in arranging the apps. You cannot order the desktop items easily. Hangs frequently. Battery drain is horrible! All in all I am not happy with the product.
0|4|This is a good phone and i feel satisfied with it. But i couldn't feel comfort as like using branded phones. It lags while playing games like Relic run and clash of clans. Better go for true 8 Core processor like Lenovo K3 Note which gives you smooth gaming experience.
0|1|here are no externel memory place in this handset , battery back up is good weigt is low means good , only lack of externel memory system is weak point of this handset , i am not satisfied.................
0|2|Since the last updation of the SW, Heating problem of handset is resolved but following new issues has raised: 1. Touch screen is working inappropriately. You will try to type something but, it will take something else on keyboard. The app windows will pop in and pop out as per there wish. Typing and surfing has become a v tedious task. 2. Disable the Data usage and Sync option. But the phone will run the applications in background and updation of the mails will keep on popping up. 3. Speakers are low in quality.
0|5|Absolutely the best one at price. Amazing fast delivery by Flipkart and Seller, ordered on Sunday, received on Tuesday morning. No heating issue at all after you update the phone. MUST GO!!
0|4|I have been using Xiaomi MI 4i for the past one month and I can vouch say that as a user i had never been so satisfied with any of the buy I made till date in the android/windows segment and mind you I owned Samsung Galaxy S3 once. The phones'light, great built conditions,amazing cameras, nice resolution and superfast processor. Sometimes it lags during browsing but only when one ventures into sites having issues with theri certtificates. Final verdict: A great buy at such an economical and competetive price tag!!!
0|4|I have ordered this from flipkart n received in 2 days, he product is too good very light at weight with awesome battery backup, hd display screen makes u feel more good to watch n show others what u carry. front n rear camera is very amazing the clearity is toooo goood. there only one point which effects it, which is no sd card slot. inbuilt memory of 16GB. it was enough for me n m happy... wish u enjoy it tooo...
1|1|I just received the phone 10 minutes ago and surprised its a used phone and even the display screen is cracked. Not sure how WS Retail could think that customers are dumb.
1|2|mobile is awesome, quality also good, but glass, its not gorilla glass, if you keep in pocket also, crack coming in glass
1|5|this phone is fine.... works smoothly. little heat issues is there,but its very minor. candy bar shape gives neat finish to the outlook of the phone. its worth buying .
1|4|The phone is fine.. no heating issues after the update.. the only thing that bothers is the rattling sound (i honestly don't know where it comes from, but it doesn't seem to affect anything) After reading some forums online, i learnt that i wasn't the only guy around... many many people who own the phone have the same sort of complain.. the camera's good.. the display's really good... i owned MI3 previously and i really missed the speakers that were placed sideways (where the mic was located) because especially when we keep the phone on a bed or something, the volume drops to nearly zero because the speakers are placed at the bottom in MI4I.. apart from that there's nothing to complain about.. the delivery time by flipkart was quite reasonable considering my location..
0|4|battery drain very fast. & MI ACCOUNT NOT CREATING. REST BEST PHONE IN FLAGSHIP. BEST BUY rEST PHONE PERFORMANCE IS GOOD
0|5|Bought this for my wife, she loves the MI experience, good battery backup, and snappy fast. Mi UI is very efficient love the MI store for downloading free wallpapers and themes.
1|2|Phone is hanging at most of times,low memory space not able to expand,volume is very low rest is ok Worth of 15K It's been two months i am using this product, It's perfect product for many actions. i ordered it in flipkart. its deliverd next day itself.
0|5|Screen resolution is excellent, camera is excellent overall happy about performance. In this price, we get better phone than samsung galaxy phones which will cost you more than 20000 Rs.
1|1|I have purchased 4i set on 6 months back but facing problem as SIM ERROR from last 4-5 months. After 3-4 days it works automatically. But I feel due 2 chines product it a system use n throw either by 1 day or 10 yrs. only throw. I vl never recommend for chines product. Also request to flip cart please take a action to replace the same item with other make only. Last alternate go to "PAHREDAR OF CNBC AAWAJ" .
0|4|I brought this phone some 2 months back its working perfectly.no issue with this phone feels premium stylish and main thing is getting update at regular interval. you can customize this phone as u want.Only think i hate about my phone is storage but now this phone is available in 32gb so guys go for 32gb one!!!Camera is good no heating issue display quality is best and best part is u can get this phone at just 13K.WOW!!!
0|3|Recently purchased this phone. Design and features are great in this price category. Battery life is also good. But have observed heating issue.
0|5|the detail is more uesful to buyer...! the mi4i phone is very nice.....! the product was very nice..! only one default in this mobile due to sunlight the display was change in white screen..
0|4|After doing a lot of analysis, I got Xiaomi Mi4i, First look... it looked awesome and Screen was superb... with some excellent hardware to support. I will be critical right away.... --- has a bit of lag if many apps are on at a time... okay though :) --- Though it supports LTE, It does not really support LTE in other countries (Eg US... the operators in US say they support different band) ---- Speaker at the back... affects the speaker sound... have to put the phone screendown.. Though it has these above mentioned so called issues... yet I felt its a great value for money... loved the camera...very sleak... nice looking... even ppl using Apple loved the look and feel of Mi4i...GOOD BUY :)
0|5|i brought this product a 2 month back and its awsm work.i recommend people to go for it,Nice looks,stylish within this range
0|1|After using 2.5 months my MI4I stopped responding WI-fi. It showed connected but net doesn't work actually. If i try to connect with new Wi-fi which was not registered earlier it does not respond. Andorid version: 5.0.2 LRX22G MIUI Version: MIUI 6.6.10.0(LXIMICF) | Stable
0|1|The battery bulged up after a month - used to heat up a lot. It has pushed the screen out in the middle.
1|1|I had purchased a Mi4i mobile phone from your marketplace on the 26th of May 2015. Though the phone was performing as expected, in the first 2 days from purchase I realized that the phone used to heat up during the charging process. On the 20th of August after returning from office, I had connected my phone to the charger and was browsing my messages on it. The phone was already heating up a lot, but I ignored it thinking that it was just a normal thing for this phone. Suddenly i saw that a crack was forming on the screen running from the top right hand corner towards the bottom left hand side. I was completely shocked and could not believe what was happening. In the next few moments that followed I saw multiple cracks happening on the screen, all originating from the same place. I could not believe my eyes and immediately removed the phone from the charger. Once the phone was removed from the charger, no more cracks appeared on it. I would suggest all customers to kindly take feedback on the over heating issue from other users as well.
0|3|two problems low sound&their is no missed call display only this two problem, handling of phone is good,to use very simple
0|5|the phone is brilliant it has amazing features in hands the phone is light and has a good sleek finish best phone used ever
0|1|I procured Xiomi 4i 2 days back and the blue tooth and wifi doesn't work properly. Also I encountered some issues with the touch.
1|5|Flipkart delivery was on time and product full fills requirement of clear camera and good battery backup and good functions
0|3|It's really like a generator.. Performance is almost good MI is going to make more money from India now..
1|5|The mobile was looking good performance wise.But I have observed charging back up wise not that much good.Even now a days smart phone are all like that only:)
0|4|1. Excellent Camera 2. Very good performance 3. Smart design 4. Long battery Overall a wonderful product. I did not observe the excessive heating issue reported by many, although the phone heats up to some extent whihc is expected during heavy use
0|5|This is such a good phone.. Look and feel is superb Touch is fantastic, smooth operation. No heating issue. Camera quality is super. True value for money! Worth Buying!
0|5|Very nice camera (Better than note 2). Plus this never hangs. Amazing UI. Loving my mi. Very nice camera (Better than note 2). Plus this never hangs. Amazing UI. Loving my mi.Very nice camera (Better than note 2). Plus this never hangs. Amazing UI. Loving my mi.
0|4|although service center is a problem for xiomi right now. but after using approx 2 month i feel u dont need it till any big problem..yes phone is stylish ,camera is good and processor is fast... the only problem is no external storage.
0|3|Although I wanted to rate this phone atleast 4 stars for its snappy MIUI, great battery and compact size, there are only couple of glitches: 1. The phone heats up like anything as soon as you play games or watch videos. 2. The camera dosen't live up to the specifications of being a 13mp snapper. The image quality kind of lets you down inspite of having rave camera reviews by some users. 3. No custom ROM yet. 4. Non removable back cover means you're pretty much stuck with white. Low style quotient. But overall good value for the price it is offered, provided you don't expect great image quality.
0|4|This is a good mobile.....but disadvantages are that it has no expandable memory, headset and I don't like SIM card insert mode. Heat problem may be resolved..now I am not felling that much heat...its general like other android mobile. But all other properties are excellent. But I will suggest to buy Moto G (3rd) rather than this one.
0|5|Excellent, Sleek & Sexy 8mm th, good looking, good performance by octa core, strong fell down & now marks, Excellent display, Easy to handle, however there are a few drawbacks are 1. Phone gets heated if talks for long. 2. Memory can't expand. 3. Signal loss in redials. 4. Slow speed in WiFi network.
0|4|Perfect for my usage. Can't believe the outstanding specs for this price range .. I love this phone because each and every specs they mentioned in the mi.com/in is just working flawless. Camera was just awesome Dual 4g is unbelievable Battery backup 1 and half a day -perfect for a multitasker Phone asthertics is just good ( i mean very slim phone) not the slimmest eventhough. Mi UI is just awesome ( i love the interface as already used MI4) Perfect buy for 15000 ( 32 gb from Mi-Store) and 16 gb form flipkart
0|5|no words to say.. simply superb.. every one is asking what the cost for this,, just 12999 is wow feel..
1|2|The phone is slow, buggy, charges better only with the supplied charger, average battery, tacky UI... I can't just go on and on. Please don't waste your money on this crap.
0|5|Value for Money. Good things Battery Performance Easy to handle Camera I am happy with product. Must buy it.
0|5|Beautiful design, great camera and good looks at a low price. MIUI is very smooth, battery also very good. Xiaomi great job, well done! Keep it up! Thank you flipkart team for delivery on time.
0|1|sorry to say its my pad experience with flipcart. I bought 2 mobiles.one is working fine and 2nd one totally different. with in 10 min the mobile heating too much...it frying pan. I'm not able to speak comfortably. I have raised a compliant twice. first time they send a link to download a software. We done it, the problem remaining the same.2 days later again raised a compliant Again they send a link. through that link they checked a device and said the device is no issue its working good. But we are using the mobile, we facing the issues, simply they said it good. I'm totally fed-up with flipcart customer care.my request is To replace the mobile. But they are rejected my request. And closed it.
1|2|The phone has issues with Battery is not that great Heating up when using 4g / 3g Sound is below par , you may miss your alarms .
0|3|The mobile is very sleek,light in weight ,looks absolutely fantastic. I'm using it for 1 week. Rear camera is OK, pictures get over exposed quite often,but the front camera is really good. Till now there is NO lag with any of the operation. When it comes to the battery this is not definitely a like a 3120 mAh battery, below average performance,Upset me :( ; With 3G ON it runs till 8 pm with fully charged battery (No heavy gaming,No much talking ). Speaker & sound output through headphone is average. Other than that everything seems to be alright.
0|4|I m using this MI 4i for past few days and I can say its an awesome phone in the market. =>Camera is good. =>battery is good . =>UI is good . =>Look is awesome . =>Internet response is good . But U can't get a headset with this model and it has heating problem.
0|3|Cons are ... it gets heated if apps are running for long time....also battery has started draining faster after updation....Phone hangs frequently.... Camera quality is too good....
0|4|Nice phone BEST surfing experience with 3G Requested to Upgraded model 3 or 4 GB ram with 32 or 64 GB ram
0|4|Overall a good product. Good results. Top notch photo quality. Top notch music results. Sleek fits in the pocket and can be operated with one hand. A minor problem is with over heating both the charger as well as the phone. Also the battery isn't as strong as told.
0|5|I have bought this phone a month ago, after lot of searching and thinking i bought this phone for many people 13k is an easy amount but for me it was my whole years savings, i really didnt want to waste my money. But i have no regret using my money in this beauty the first thing is its look, its very stylish and so light it makes you feel elegant and stylish. its back cover to the front can make people stare at you, fo music its great too and works alot well you can play music for whole day and it still has charge left, social media app's like whatsapp if you use them the battery would stay around for 8 hours i enjoy playing most of the games in it,the phone almost never hangs or lags, its best. You should buy it! the only thing i find weird is its heating up but if you have a good cover like me you wont face any problems and its 16gb memory for people who need ore try out the 32gb thing XD and guess what? after this phone i don't want any nexus or any phone i rally love it :D
0|5|Really Awesome device at this range. Looks Great. Slim and Light. Fast, Smooth and Quick. Camera is really DHASOO. Display and picture quality is EK DUM MAST.. MIUI interface is feels like iPhone. The only issue is Heating and Lower Ringer Volume which has been resolved in System Updates. Overall the phone can compete to iPhone 5 in many aspects. "Mi4i" Guess what "i" stands for India or iPhone, its really fulfill both standards.
0|5|The Phone is good for its price. 1. Screen is exceptionally beautiful with good contrast & sunlight visibility. Design is very sleek. 2. Heating problem is avoided at moderate use and after software update. 3. Drawback of sd card addition is reduced by OTG capability of the phone. I suggest Strontium SD card with pen drive reader @ 900 odd ruppes from Snapdeal with Class 1 features. High read/write accessibility can be obtained from this. 4. MIUI 6 or 7 are good but one error with Chanel log non display creeping up. Mi customer care is bad for accessing. Ph always busy. 5. One problem I faced is that the missed call display is not up to the mark. When a call is not lifted it is rejected and seldom displays on the lock screen. also it is not displayed when then screen is opened and call list is accessed. Other phones indicate in red colour, the missed calls not attended. This I could not clarify from MI as the phones are busy.
0|1|working condition is very very poor and slow. and also it doesn't have external storage capacity.mobile struct evenly.no one try to buy this product.
0|4|ALL THE FEATURES ARE PERFECT AT THIS PRICE LEVEL. ENJOYING THE PHONE. GOOD PHONE AT AFFORDABLE PRICE, NICE CAMERA AND SOUND AND INTERNAL MEMORY OF 16GB
0|1|Poor and low quality material......don't buy... 1.sound quality so bad. 2.No headphones 3.lack of accessories in market 4-Bad customer service 5-Low quality screen
1|4|Used it for a month, you cant cool your hunger for performance off with 13k spend. Its a small machine with loads of mediocre technology inside, bound to get hot. Overall performance is good, meets all the daily usage. Battery is a plus. Size and Shape, added plus. If anyone willing to shed the brand ego , good catch for them .Rest no comparison with the bests in the technology and brand.
1|5|In this range its just awesome a phone.......I am a photographer & in any mobile that I use,I first look for the camera & I so very pleased with its camera (both front & rear)....few shortcomings are there....but everything's have positive & negative.....and if u see the negative only.....u can never ever see the positive side of it........
0|4|Positive : Nice features, cheap, camera quality is good, biggest benifit is screen 5 inch but mobile overall size is small which is good to handle with one hand. Negative : space concern 16GB if more use i recommended to buy 32GB internal memory. Overall value for money ............
0|5|super mobile..no heating problem...no hanging issues...almost 2 days battery backup when fully charged...I think all people who have doubt regarding this mobile you have a green signal....Look wise also its very awesome and a very handy set... Camera quality is definately good...the front camera is better than the back one.. Very easy to handle
0|5|MIUI with Android makes it best in class. fully customised home and side screens gives a better appearance. Happy after purchase.
0|3|Good Specifications but gets heated even while normal use, no provision for external memory card. The phone got hanged while playing Subway Surfers and had to long press power button to switch off. After that it couldn't be switched on and while charging it got heated so much.
0|2|i purchased mobile before 4 months .according to my view mi 4i mobie is not at all reaching my expectation. low volume. huge heating problem.
0|1|when i requeste for replacement they deny for that , this time i am fedup from flipkart the product automatically shut down and battery heats very much
0|5|if there would be a option of 4.5 stars rating then i give 4.5 stars because of some problem of heating but not more as redmi series. it is very nice and light weight makes it more perfect.
0|5|What do I say. It feels like an iphone @ Rs.12999. Overstatement? I don't want to be too geeky here but the phone has a brilliant UI, camera provides crystal clear pictures, I love the keyboard, battery charges pretty fast and the phone doesn't hang. I haven't yet tested the maps but I am sure Xiaomi has done a good job with the maps as well. Overall at Rs. 12999, this phone is too good to be true.
0|5|mi4i is pretty awesome phone, touch is very smooth and responsive. camera is excellent photos comes out very bright and even selfies.
0|4|first product I received was faulty with frequent call drops. after reporting to flipkart, they replaced my Mi4i. I am loving this mobile as very handy, excellent camera, fast and nice display. specs mentioned within 13K range is really good.
0|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT: really it has heating issue while first time switching on it but ITS GOOD AFTER UPDATE... camera and display are EQUIVALENT TO MY apple 6 .... its totally best option who plan to apple 6 can avail it
0|2|software problem...hiting problem..hang over this phone....itz very bad...nd very slow.... mi 1s compares very bad mi 4i..
0|2|A newly purchased Mi 4i phone, when turned on, it stucked at statup with a flickering screen when choosing language repeatedly. Another issue, the phone heats up soon..draining lot of battery. Now, i feel i should have purchased some other Mi.
1|5|I was very confused when I ordered this since there were lots of negative feedbacks about this. Only issues I found was heating but after MIUI upgrade it become normal. Very impressed the performance and look and feel of phone. Audio quality is excellent.
1|2|Hi, Please dont buy this one, better to go for Mi4 than Mi4I. Mi4I have various issues like after upgrade its front camera was giving distorted images, heating problem and in conference calls its UI gets hanged. i replaced it once and now the second one is okay not giving much problem but not smooth though, UI still gets hanged sometimes.
0|1|Really, I researched for almost a month to get a new phone and zeroed on the highly glamorous MI4I... only to met such dire dissapointment, that within a month of use I am fed up. Instances below: 1. Candy Crush takes 45 seconds to open. 2. Wassap crashes every 2 out of 5 times. 3. EXTREMELY BAD Signal receptors. In low signal areas it will instantly show no signal. 4. IT HANGS! (Within 1 month) 5. I can cook rotis on the backside with-in 15 minutes of continuous use. 6. Longer Battery: Bull-shit, it discharges with 2 hours of continuous use. 7. I have only 3 additional apps on the phone (Myntra + Candycrush + Paytm) - it still hangs. 8. I have this extremely irritating continuous screen which says don't cover the top part of the phone. 10. Any link (for eg: your friend shared a link of shirt on myntra) will open on the browser and not on Myntra app - there's not even a option for that. 11. It is slightly big - not ergonomic to hold in hand And - It doesn't have everything customizable as the MIUI6 claims! It's a sham! Pros: Yes there are - I am not a Hater, just a victim of glamorous marketing: 1. Camera is very good - but it hangs! 2. It has some cool features, like transition effects, merge contacts. 3. Screen colours are good too. With so many good reviews below, I am still open to contention that maybe I got a bad dysfuntional piece, but what about UX/UI problems?
1|1|This is a review after using the phone for more than 45 days now. First I want to highlight the phone's build, It has a very smooth back cover and it can easily slip from your hands anytime. There is minimal to none grip on this phone. The borders of the screen is so thin you always close or touch some other icon when you are using the phone. Now to the UI .... This is the most unstable UI i have seen on xiaomi phones. Facebook, dialer, messaging, settings always crash. I don't understand where the 2 GB RAM is being utilized. And, the customer service is so pathetic. what ever you ask them on the phone, chat or email. They just re-direct you to the service centre and generously provide you the address and the phone numbers. I have used MI3, MI 4, MI 4i, redmi 2. I have never seen such delicate build, unstable UI on any of the phones. If you buy this phone you will definitely repent as I am doing currently.
0|5|Good phone..buy it only from Flipkarrt...I think its because of Flipkart People have started buying phones online. Trustworthy....Great work Flipkart and good phone MI
0|5|happy to buy this phone.There is no heating problem.The thing depends on how you use the device.Its really fast and batter back up is also good.camera is just awsum !!!
0|5|This Phone is an excellent product at this price. You'll never regret. Thanks Mi and Flipkart I think low light camera would have been made little better however it still provides great clarity.
0|5|The phone's camera is really good. Also the battery is long running.. Good enough flash. overall its best phone at this price . Go for it.
1|4|nice phone ..good performance ..but slows down when heated ,especially while continuous gaming...good screen ..epic battery life .and alarm sounds even when the phone is switched off cool :)
0|4|i'm using the product for last 4 moths, pros compact size good display mi ui superb camera cons poor battery backup , when mobile data enabled battery is draining quickly mobile data reception is not good
0|5|This phone delivers more than expected performance. I have been using this phone for more than 3 months now. Till now the phone was hanged 2-3 times even though I keep multiple apps running at a time. With respect to performance, I have played most of the high graphic games on this phone like Asphalt, Modern Combat, Brothers in Arm, Sim city etc. All the games works smoothly without any lag. It runs full HD movies smoothly. The display is crisp. Touch is comparable to iPhone. Looks are good. Camera is comparable to iPhone. At night also camera captures pretty much detailed picture. It has manual setting for camera that gives options to adjust focus, exposure and ISO of the rear camera. The sound quality is very good. Gives deep bass and crisp music. As per your headphones, they have given you the different configurability options. The MIUI provides you the permission control where you can control the priviledges used by apps, that is you can edit whether your FB app can read your contacts or messages or can it access your camera etc. MIUI is very much configurable, plus every month the updates are received, like CynogenMod. The heating problem is there but it heats up just like any other android phone, nothing extraordinary like what other reviews mention. The storage is limited with 12 GB of usable, which exhausts quickly. But then you can use OTG cable worth Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 to connect any of USB storage like 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 GB pendrive or even an external harddisk, so storage is not a problem.
1|4|in compare to other costly phones this one is really good one. no sense in buying other costly phones being there value decreasing day by day and also they mostly doesn't work for many years then wats the sense of wasting too much money
0|4|xiomee good company great service in Ahmedabad redmi note display issue replace in 15 minute same dya camera good performance good O S issu not great available ram less
0|5|What more do you want at this price? The only con being its plastic body, you can correct it by buying a good quality back cover..
0|4|Pros: - premium feel. - light weight - thin - long lasting battery - 2gb ram Cons: - miui is ram consuming - some set has front camera problem
1|2|SD card is really required in 16gb else product also MI needs to include hands free with products. Heating only when playing HD graphics, that happens in many phones. And Flipkart delivery is Worst ever got product very late .
0|4|The Product is very good, the resolution, the camera, design of the handset all top notch, how ever since a custom UI is built on top of Android, Few Short Commings 1) which on Update out of 16 GB left me with 7 GB only, more than Half of the Space is used by the OS only. that is major CON, also 2)the custom UI doesn't allow some feature of apps, such as Chat Heads from FB Messenger will not float around on home screen,You will get a notification nut no chat head, +1 if u don't like FB chat heads, -1 if u do. 3) Ring tone volume is mild, and speakers are at the back side so put the phone on a table and go to other room you will not her the phone ring. 4) There's a bug in the MIUI pc Suite doesn't allows the phone to be backed up even though MIUI has been updated, gives the same error update your phone. 5) Does get heated up little when intense usage 3g and Gaming at the same time 6) The Permission Manager is very annoying to me sometimes. 7) Difficult to use chrome in Mi 4i 6 If give it 4 stars as nothing can be perfect, overall superb phone , enjoying every minute of it, if the above things don't bother you go ahead order one like me now,
1|4|Initially when purchased I had problem with charging. I don't know why? Then when updates start to come. finally felt good. However volume alone is low in mi4i
0|5|Very good smartphone. both camera quality is excellent, battery backup is very good......very slim and handy. Really loved the product..Best to buy upto 13000.
0|4|Happy Independence Day to all Have been using it for three months as of now. Nice specs. Heating issue gone with an 700-800 mb update. Off late showing some lag while playing Asphalt Air borne and yes that is an issue with this phone. Hope MIUI get some better in future. Battery back-up is good. But, Dear Flipkart people , the same phone is available for at least Rs.1,000/- lesser. Hope to see some price slashing of price of MI-4i on our Favourite Flipkart as well.....
0|5|This phone is so good and at the starting it heat up the phone .But after update (Version: V6.6.10.0.LXIMICF ?MIUI6?) ,phone will not be heat up . At this time ,phone is so good at this price and I think it is better than Asus Zenfone 2 ZE550ML .
0|5|so i have been using this for around 10 days now.. so straight to the points -the MIUI interface is surprisingly nice -multi tasking is smooth, don't expect flawless multi tasking(only one app definitely hangs your phone when multitasking and that is facebook.. definitely red flag) -the battery is just awesome, almost as promised but it drains when you are relelntlessly using it for browsing..(for continuous browsing you will lose 80% charge for 10 hours approx) -you can easily watch atleast 10 hrs of videos for a full charge -the display is what striked me very hard, in a pleasant way though.. awesome display -the RAM is fine, all the processes run smoothly -12 gb usable ROM looks enough... you can easily fit in 3 or 4 movies... -overall physically, it's a very likeable one as well, very light and the design is very sleek and slim.. easily holdable in a hand! - now coming to the gaming part, i haven't played any game, so I can't comment on its performance there In the end completely satisfied, go for it!!
0|5|Very happy with phone, battery life, camera, touch, double tap to wake, other features are very useful. it was so good that my wife gave up her galaxy grand and snatched mine after 2 mins.
0|5|heating only on playing heavy games.....bcause of heating i delayed mi4i wen i got and use my phone i don't got any heating.......amazing phone buy it without hesitation......
1|5|Phone build quality is excellent. Front and back camera performs well. Only one problem with the phone is over heating even when the phone is idle
1|5|I liked the product very much and its comfortable and light weight. working fast and no lagging i faced during normal use. heating when you keep for charging, watching videos. normal use its recommended.
0|5|Has a class of its own. Man even the look makes you feel it good. Heating effect has been reduced to a great level now. Camera is fabulous. Inbuilt apps are good especially the Music Player. If you are looking at it here I say "Go For It".
0|1|Very fragile screen...It shattered from a slight fall from 1 feet...Phone touch stopped working so i had to go for replacement..Stupid customer service engineer says this phone comes with ordinary glass (doesnt even knows the glass type)..Charged me Rs3705 for replacing the screen...Service charging all payment in cash...very bad attitude at service center.. seems like they have given us phone for free.. Know i am always scared in carrying the phone...This phone has become big pain in butt..
1|2|I wouldnt recommend to buy this one. This is a very poor quality item manufactured by MI. MI4 was much much better to use and also quality wise much better
1|1|Speaker sound high to low automaticaly.Otherwise it is a nice phone very slim very light weight.Good Battery life.Camera quality is low not great comparison to other 13MP Camera mobiles like Samsung,Sony,Micromax etc.
0|5|Thanks to flipkart's 1 day delivery, Got the product very fast. This is a best smart phone within Budget. Camera and performance is awesome....video quality is best(441ppi) and can be compared with Any other brand. Good product from xiaomi.
0|5|This is my first ever Mi phone, firstly the best ever display that provides with 441 ppi density, full HD and worth for 13000 in each n every aspect, heating issues are common in every android as it gets heated on HD gaming usage, but not such as you can't hold, every smartphone you get, it will be older bcoz of newly inventions presented in market day by day...This time...its Mi time..go for it..!
0|5|You have to get used to not having and app drawer. But otherwise totally good product. Firstly, Flipkart's deliver was swift and the packing and handling was Good. Coming to the phone. This is something you should go for if flaunting the brand is not your thing. I think Mi brand is a Brand good enough. The phone's battery life is great. I use it for about a 30-35 hours with wifi completely on. Using data every 10 mins. Browsing feeds on various apps and an hour of call everyday. If you dont do this much, battery might even come up to a full 2 days. The camera is the best thing so far in this phone. with the manual option, i did not think it would be this good. But is as good as a low end DSLR in your hand. especially with the Focus and Shutter speed settings. I've had no hanging of the phone so far. Only once did it restart automatically. The only negative is heating. Not like this becomes a hot frying pan. But the phone heats up a little. very little when you try to go hardcore on the hardware. But that too is not a worry. It cools off pretty soon if you stop things that are not necessary. So I'd Say. Go for it. This is a cool phone. The design and hardware are the best. Thumb's up for Mi
0|3|Have been using this phone for the past 4 months Since mid of May 2015. I switched from a Xolo Q800 which I had been using for the past 2 .5 years. I switched primarily because I wanted to switch to a 4G device and Mi4i had 2 4G sim slots. The other reason to go for Mi4i against MotoG2 or the ASUS Zenphone 2 was the 441 PPI screen resolution and the 2GB RAM. The high resolution facilitates viewing my photographs taken in the DSLR in its full colour spectrum and the tiny little details. I like the MIUI interface although it takes few days to get accustomed to. I recieve constant software updates to the MIUI, I remember atleast 3 in the last 4 months now. Which is good since the defects are rectified earlier. The battery lasts an average of 1 day (I recharge it every night ), i use it heavily for browsing the net and attend long telephonic meetings. There are some minor defects like the missed calls not shown or getting shown as rejected. I believe now it is corrected with the software update. I wished I had more memory (since no SD card), its only now that Mi offers the 32 GB version for Rs 2000 extra. I would strongly suggest you go for the 32 Gb instead of 16 GB, I you store a lot of Media files & Photographs. The GPS is not on par with the earlier devices i had. My Brothers Moto G2 triangulates the position in seconds while Mi4i takes ages (even 10 mins sometime) to lock a position. My earlier XOLO Q800 was way far better with its GPS. The other issue i faced is the drop of Data Connection (not sure if it is a problem with Airtel) where i had to restart my mobile for it to connect to a Data network. The Camera output has been very good so Far. One other feature I have liked is the option to record conversations with a touch button in the call interface. I have also liked and used the Digital Compass a few time Overall I am satisfied except for the GPS issue I face & Data connection.
0|3|I would think more memory will be advantage to this phone, but its not extendable. Camera really amazing.
0|4|A lot of feature are good but some times facing hanging problem. camera quality is toooooo good like HDR pro mode is Aweosum but during calling screen has been blank & facing some time heating problem also
0|1|Phone gets heat up so much that basic functionality such as talking on handset is not possible. Battery does not last for more than 4 hours.
0|5|The Performance of this phone is awesome, no doubt about that. But the User Interface could have been much better. It comes with the default Mi launcher, which certainly is not good to use.
0|4|Pros Light weight camera (front camera good sharp image) Cons Call volume is very low in phone and speaker Need to charge day very even for minimal usage
0|5|Superb mobile. stylish design. very handy excellent performance. no hanging no delay. very good experience from MI. Only one negative i felt is heating issue, only comparing with high end phones.
1|5|Mi4I is a good phone after getting updates most of its flaws are rectified but while calling when loud speaker is on mic is not functioning
0|4|phone is good graphics as well as camera and touch is very fine ....bt there is lack in sound and heating problem in phone...otherwise, phone is good.....!!!!
0|3|pros: display,battery,camera cons: heating issue on gaming n on call more than 15 minutes, also having the hanging problem, from few days it could not able to connect to the data connectivity,low speaker output which is an issue when ur outdoors or travelling.
0|4|I hv been using this phone for about 20 days now....Quickly I'll give u a brief account of pros and cons of this product. PROS -> has got a great display with vibrant colors -> interface is cool and touch feels smooth...the design is sleek and classy....is very light weight which is definitely a high point ->the best part is the camera....the sony's camera is the standout performer of mi4i ....specially at this price range....sometimes I feel the front 5mp cam performs better than the rear 13mp cam :D -> the 2gb ram handles multi tasking smoothly though you might need to clear up RAM sometimes CONS -> the device gets heated up sooner and more compared to other devices....though it's not that troublesome -> games like subway surfer and temple run run smoothly most of the times...but on rare occassions..I don't know why they lag -> the camera won't give as crisp pictures at night time as it gives under bright light -> one of the low points is the speaker...its considerably low when compared to moto G. the speaker panel is present at rear....if you hv a low pitched ringtone..then there's a possibility u might miss your call -> no expandable storage...around 13gb internal storage exists which should be good enough for most people I guess personally...I like this device...but I hv tried to present an unbiased review to it...hope this helps for would be buyers Flipkart was a bit late than usual in its delivery....took 8 days for me I will update this review...if any worthy pros or cons is found !!
0|4|its a very gud phone from xiaomi..... all things are very gud but front camera could be better..bcoz....when u click ur face pic then it is faded ....... except it it is cool in performance and primary dcamera is decent in day....
0|5|I was thinking a lot before buying Mi 4i as there were so many reviews about heating , have been using this for the last 3 days never felt anything.The display is amazing , lite weight all in all a good buy.
0|5|bought 4i after much research..was using Moto X earlier so it was a potential downgrade:-) However after using the device for over a month now- 1.Great VFM buy. 2.Very decent appearance.I wished they had steel back cover like in Mi4,that could have given little more premium look. 3,Technical performance very satisfactory. 4.Doesn't heat up as reported in several reviews.This was the major concern,unfounded. Overall,very happy with the purchase..GO for it!
0|5|I got Mi4i from last month but having camera blur issue problem but flipkart support gives new replacement of mi4i and its work fine now. Forgot about anyone else review. Must buy this one. Its a best budget phone ever seen on history. Why Mi4i ? 1) Best battery backup 2) Best selfie as well as back camera. 3) Its easily compare to samsung galaxy s6 with all the features. 4) Fast charging capabilities 5) Slim look like iphone5 6) Extensive performance not any hang issue till. 7) It now come with 32GB variant so no need for more space. 8) Main thing about Mi4i is Its Display quality. What the display mi provide with this phone. Its easily compare to iphone6 display and its best too. 9) Better color on display. Enjoy movie with it. 10) Forget about heating issue. Its not heat after update the phone. Its a normal thing of heating when you use phone with charging. iphone is also heat. 11) Best class in Budget. 12) Must buy from flipkart. Its services is too good compare to other one. No any single negative word for mi4i.
0|5|Bought in first sale of Mi 4i, using since 3 months now. No lag in performance faced. Camera is also great. Also there is no heating issue after the update.
1|5|Using this mobile for last 1 month. no problem, Camera is Superb. Battery backup is good. A bit heating issue which can be ignored.
0|5|Nice Phone But Should Have Waited For Few Days For 32 GB Variant If I Would Had Known Before. But It Is Also A Nice Phone To Use
1|2|I have brought this Mobile .. Just got delivered.. When i open the box to check the accessories it only contains Charger and handset.. Called Customer care they said product Does Not contain headphones. Pros:- Overall phone is gud.. Cons:- No headphones :( Ringing Volume is bit low .. Does This product contains headphones? let me Know Thanks
0|4|Good: * Primary and secondary cameras very good * no hanging * good battery back-up Bad: * Heating issue * ear phones not provided * Suitable screen guard not available in ouside market
0|3|the phone hangs atleast 2 times daily , RAM is never available more then 800 MB , Problem connecting Wifi Within 2 months of purchase , Updates every Week - very time consuming. Not at all meant for a business use , for less usage may be helpful .
0|4|The device is very good. Except for some heating at the top of the device and 16GB being too low. The software though needs improvement. Features are missing from the basic android lollipop. Hopefully they will get added in the next version of MIUI.
0|5|the best in phones which i used earlier very fast delivery by flipkart Light weght nice battery backup
0|5|Good Mobile, Did not find any Battery and Heating issue as mentioned by many. Worth the price. Only not expandable Memory, so need to play with 11GB memory.
0|4|I bought this phone about a month ago from flipkart. It was delivered in 7 days which was somewhat late but still not a big issue. Here is what I have seen after using it for about 15-20 days Appearance : 5 stars (looks are nice and comparable to i-phone) Camera : 5 stars (front and back camera both are really good) Call quality : 3.5 stars ( average call quality, could have been better in terms of voice o/p) Voice quality : 2.5 stars ( terrible voice quality, if running on speakers, however on headphones the sound is fab) Battery : 4 stars ( If fully charged, I can use it for 6-8 hours continuously for gaming, but when Net is connected it drains somewhat faster ) display : 5 stars ( simply say Full HD display) UI : 5 stars lag issue : lags a bit on some small games like "Brain Dots" but Asphalt 8 runs just fine without any lag. heating issues : heating only a bit after hours of gaming which is okay for me. Overall I would say that if you are looking for a phone in the range of 12-13k then it is worth buying.
0|2|I had Redmi note earlier so i was quite a fan of MI but this phone is just unbearable... software does not work properly ... heating like a stove... 4g speed pathetic... good specs but u cannot use them... only plus the looks and display
0|2|Xiomi has compromised on the screen protection (Corning Gorilla Glass is not there) to reduce the cost. This phone will get easily damaged. My phone has a minor crack which is barely visible ( Unfortunately Flipkart dont allow to attach photos, I do have one if Flpkart allows for you to have a look). Now my phone is as good as a brick, it does not recognize touch. Compare this with other similar phones say lumia 630 (older model though) continues to work even after the glass is broken. This issue is reported in the Mi forums also along with other known issues like overheating. Read yourself before you take a decision, to see the extent of this issue. I had posted a link to the relevant Mi Official forum, which was removed by flipkart as it was against their policy. In summary, this phone is only for those who keep their phone in their showcases :-), not for regular use. There are better options available. Giving 2 stars for its looks and decent performance while it worked, but this is definitely not a value buy.
1|5|Bought this 2 months back. Decent specs at a great price. Saw that a lot of users have reported heating issues.. i have not faced any such issue. Granted i dont use it for heavy gaming. If you are a normal user then dont think you need to worry about heating probs. As always prompt delivery from flipkart.! Kudos!
0|5|This is one of the best phones i have ever used. i bought a 32gb version from MI site but i am writing this review here as some people are misleading by adding negative reviews. to be honest this is an amazing phone bang on for the price offered. 1. Heating: this phone gets just a little warm not too much i have used this phone for a week now even 3 days on the previous version. it just gets warm, stop calling it a heater or stuff , a power packed phone will get this warm if you find it too hot better buy some samsung or nokia 101 because that is what is suited for you like how can you not expect a a octa core phone to heat this much. 2. Lagging: there is no lag in this phone at all. miui is heavy but the ram is optimized enough to let you have a lag free experience. 3. Miui needs to be studied well before you know all the features, so stop complaining about things missing everything is well perfect just explore the setting properly. 4.Sound: sound is little low but i found it normal not too low and that is not a deal breaker at all. The phone is the best in this range: perfect camera, perfect looks and perfect experience. Those complaining about only 9 gb available guys every phone having 16gb internal will offer only 9-10gb so flipkart or mi is not misleading you, you are just dumb and not entitled to buy a smart phone. In my opinion you should buy this phone without thinking at all don't think about the bad reviews it is a must buy and trust me you will love it :D
0|1|I bought this mobile after checking its configuration, which looks very attractive. After buying, withing a month this mobile started annoying me. Following are the issues which I faced 1. Heating problem - Mobile was getting heated while charging or surfing the net. 2. Network issues - This mobile was not catching the network signals, while at the same place network signals were recieved by other mobile (Micromax) for same Network service provider. 3. Charging issue - After a few days handset started taking a lot of time for 100% charging. and after a few more days. Mobile stopped charging at all by the charger given with Mi4i. 4. Mobile dead - After charging it by using some other charger, now that charger also stopped charging. Now mobile is totally dead. 5. Service Center issues - This is extremmme now .. when I checked the service centers in Mumbai, Maharashtra on Xiami's website, it gave me few service centers. I tried calling on them, those phone numbers were not working. On website, their working time is given as 10am to 6pm, but you have to reach out there before 5pm to get a token, then wait for long time to get your number and then submit your mobile for atleast 8 to 10 days. So poorest customer service .. I would rate 0/5 .. No ratings for this mobile. Its a trash for me now.
1|4|+points : apps , camera, touch, speed, browers never hang up and etc -points : heavyuse come by heating up its self , internal memory is ok but external memroy is not that is that main point so , not is cost for 12,999 is not worthless ...... but before u wan buy is this product or not
0|3|PROS. 1- good performance 2- 12 gb user available memory 3- 2gb Ram for multi tasking 4- killer sunlight Display with new sunlight technology 5- enough battery backup for a full day. 6- Nice camera with slow motion video. Cons. 1- No memory card support 2- Device heating while playing video and game. 3- user have use only 12 gb memory 4-battery performance not good compare then red-mi note 4g but one thing i share with everyone.... very good service of flip kart delivery time ease return ease replacement humble customer support
0|3|Hi folks, Mi4i is with good UI and features. Xiomi has announced for MIUI7 version by end of august. Camera clearity is nice. U will not have memory card slot is the only draw back.
0|4|? Pros: - Premium feel, light as a feather - Superb form factor, comfortable to hold and operate - Clear screen, slim bezels, sunlight display really works - No heating issues with latest update and 2nd Gen Snapdragon processor - Sharp back camera, sufficient front camera - Dual flash for different light conditions - Decent battery, lasts one full day - Dual 4G sim - Smooth but limited MIUI 6, could be better - Great for gaming - Supports HEVC/H.265 videos natively, so great for movies and videos - Free Screenguard from Xiaomi if you register your mi 4i on their website ? Cons: - No Micro SD slot (This can be a dealbreaker) - Speaker could be louder - Phone is slippery despite matte finish, definitely requires a cover for grip - Not a big upgrade from Mi 3, apart from the processor - MIUI is not the best OS, I think vanilla Android is better - No point in 4G capability since only a few cities have 4G network ? In the box: - 5" Mi 4i - Rapid Charger and USB cable - Instruction manuals - Pin to open the sim card slot
0|5|Xiomi you did it again. You guys actually know how to make a common human being a tech gadget savvy in a budgeted way ... hats off for thing for common human being
1|2|I bought Mi4i On 7th july, after reading all the amazing reviews about it. However had a bad experience with the same, The applications crash abruptly , even the os malfunctions at times. The screen isnt scratch resistant either. The screen on time is barely 4.5 hours The camera however is excellent the stars I give are only for the amazing Camera. Flipkart was considerate enough to give me a replacement for the same without any hassle. However even the replaced device had the same issue.
1|4|Great product at good price, only disadv is its camera which is good only for seeing pic on phone as pictures have no zoom sound quality so bad. U can miss many calls due to poor sound. overall phone is ok
0|5|Best in Class .....This is whayyy Goood . I being using it over a month now . Nothing i feel beats it. Superb battery Avg Speakers Superb Finish Easy to Use and Amazinglyyy Fast. Not a single heating issue ever after the latest update. People Stop investing in Other phones. This is a Benchmark . Highly Recommended ........
0|2|HEAT ISSUE IRRITATING AND SPACE NOT ACTUAL 16 10 GB ONLY FREE THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR EXPECTING MORE NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY
0|3|firstly the look of the phone is awesome, the 5 inch display with full hd resolution make it joy to watch compare to other phone Heating issue after the latest update is been minimized ie MIUI 6.6.6 Battery life is also improved, But the serious note this phn is not for the heavy gamer the lightweight id also a plus point compare with others phone in the same price this phn nailed down others so go for it
0|5|Oh! I am amazed by the screen, but after a few days of usage, I can confirm that the Mi3 was better. Of course Snapdragon 800 is obviously better than Snapdragon 615. Mi 4i is good for day to day use, and the added lollipop update is for the people keep on cribbing for Lollipop. People need to know that when you are using MIUI OS you dont see any difference on KitKat or Lollipop. Overall the device is excellent at this price poinit, the build quality is superior to any device at the same price point or even higher
0|1|I had ordered Xiaomi Mi4i - 16 GB Grey through WS Retail. The delivery of the same was done just one day prior to the expected delivery date so had to wait for a longer time. I wouldn't like to mention the specifications so will directly go on to the review. I used this mobile for a total of 3.5 days only as on the third day half of the display suddenly became blurred. I called up the customer care of Flipkart and they told me that if the hardware doesn't support the apps then the display can become blurred. After much follow up my money amounting to 13K was refunded after almost a month. My review is based on the 3.5 days of usage. Pros: Very light weight (130 g) so easy to hold. LED notification is good. Build quality is nice. Design is very sleek. The processing is quite fast (2GB RAM and 16 GB ROM). Camera is really good both back and front. The display was the highlight of this mobile as it is a full HD display but sadly this the feature which put me off later. LTE Support for both the SIM's. Battery life is good, the battery lasted almost 1.5 days. Cons: The heating issue is the biggest problem with this phone. It is really irritating to hold a mobile which heats up very quickly even if I am just checking out SMS or just simply browsing the internet for 5 -10 mins or on a call for more than 10 mins. No headset is given along with the mobile. The audio quality at the time of calling is very average. The audio quality on the speaker is very poor actually as good as mute. As the experience of this mobile wasn't upto the mark especially because the display went off in just 3.5 days of usage it left me very disappointed so I didn't order it again. I have recently ordered Moto G 3rd Gen as it was in the same price range. Conclusion: Based on my experience I wouldn't suggest this mobile to anyone also Flipkart needs to improve on their customer service front.
0|4|some people who want to destroyed the business of mi4i...this is grt phone ever i saw in this range of money.over all a great phone.....
0|5|Received in 5 days, Very good phone. very good display, cameras, and I play a lot of games. and response is just fabulous.
0|4|Its been more than a month since i got this phone. Awesome Phone. works fine. Camera quality good. Interface good. worth the buy. there are small small cons though.. MI's have their own UI which consumes little bit of more ram when compared to normal phones like Moto. and using camera for more than 30 minutes continuously makes the phone kinda slow and u need to restart the phone or close all apps and open , probably because of RAM consumption. otherwise WORKS PERFECTLY :)
0|5|Pro's 1 Camera - Really Really Good 2 Display - Jaw Dropping! 3 Looks - Totally killing it! 4 Speed - Light Speed! Con's 1 No SD expansion - Eh, Don't want, Don't Care. 16GB Good Enuf. Note About The Heating Issue: There is No heating issue with this phone...keep the phone updated and you are good to go!
0|5|Brought Xiaomi phone for the first time. Using it for a month now. Pros: -Amazing display. -MIUI 6 and its customization options. -Brilliant battery life: 14-15 hours with heavy usage Over 1 day with moderate usage -Fast, smooth performance. -Weekly updates for MIUI. Cons:(none whatsoever although) -FHD Display can be a bit of battery drainer but using the phone intelligently will eliminate this.
0|4|Excellent Performance, Stunning Display, Good Build Quality. Worth spending 13000. From last three months i am using this phone.
0|1|• You could feel the heat on your ears while calling someone over this phone Useless of having this heating machine. perhaps we could use it for ironing shirts and pants etc., It is really painful headache having this phone on hand.
0|5|It is a very good phone in this price range. Camera is really superb both front and back. One you get latest update no heating issue. Please make sure the first thing you do is get latest update.
0|5|I was hearing many review on Heating, over heating, Hyper Heating.. Its been over a month since i purchased and using it, have not had any lag, hang or over heating issues. Its us as how normally a phone heats when on voice calls or 3G data. I am enjoying it on my every usage. Dispplay is super duper Full HD adds richness to videos or photos. Camera is Good with F/2.0 -Depth of field is awesome. Only one drawback is with the loudspeaker volume while ringing. I hardly hear while driving. Except that it is awesome piece for the spent of 12999.. Could have waited for 32 GB at 14999 ;-)
0|4|not awesome at the perfomance but probably the best piece at this cost.a little problem when we see the camera the pics which are taken so clarity we can see the breaking of pixelss
0|1|Within one month of my purchase of the phone, Mother board got crashed. Handed over the phone in MI service centre. (Still my phone is there only) At first I was impressed by the camera, but it gets heated immediately after the usage of 5 minutes. I will not suggest this phone to anyone.
0|2|Good Phone some problems but ok Hanging Problem, Charging problem some times not charge. Some heating issues this phone. Space Problem No extra Memory Card Insert in this phone. But Ok....
1|5|After 7 months of usage i am writing the review, very good performance. Sometimes heats up during charging, speed is very good.
0|5|I am using this product for last 3 months. Below I have mentioned pros & cons based on my usage / experience - Pros - Great Battery back-up, stands for 1.5 - 2 days easily with normal usage (1-2 hrs daily calling, 1-2 hrs other online stuff) - No heating issues as mentioned by many reviewers, I have done 1 hr Video calling several times, didn't experience any heating.. although I didn't check heavy games - Camera Quality is amazing, both front & back, front being with beautify feature does great job :-) - quite light & sleek phone, very crisp & clear screen display (441 dpi) - Processor works really fast, MIUI interface is very good Cons - - Sound Output is quite low, both on speaker as well as earphones (MI doesn't provide earfones, I checked it with my Sony earfones) - Proximity sensor feature is not very user friendly, if we enable it.. we can't do anything during call as screen becomes blank and doesn't take any command till call ends, if we don't .. screen will be lit-up during call duration most of the time Overall a decent phone in this budget, worth buying :-)
0|1|I didn't get the sim tray for my Mi4i mobile . i made a request for return but they didn't respond till now.
0|4|I wont speak much about other pros cons except the important one Heating issue . After unpacking , started the mobile and I could feel its heating . Checked few blogs and found that new processor is causing this heating .Latest update with modified Algorithm helps processor not to heat much . After updating the firmware to MIUI V6.6.6.0 LXIMICD. Factory reset again . Heating problem reduced . I checked it by playing HD movie and internet at same time . But still after continuous use there is some heat but much improved compared to what I felt earlier.
0|3|Found not that much problems with this phone. A definite VFM. But when it comes to 3g connectivity, its often getting disconnected. Always showing some messages like " Sim is removed"...
0|3|A superb piece of engineering that has been let down by a few glitches. When you are watching videos for a while (say for 45 minutes or so), the device is heating up, not to the extent of feeling like dropping like a hot bag of coal but enough to feel uncomfortable. The volume is simply not sufficient. Being used to Moto-G to wake me up in the morning this came as a rude shock with a volume that seems more like a lullaby than an alarm. Whatever I did, couldn't increase the volume beyond a certain limit. Also you can't just hear the phone ringing in a slightly noisy place. To add insult to injury, this comes with a feature of auto-answer. Without my knowing the ruddy thing picks up the call and my callers are easily eavesdropping on whatever I am doing / saying. Awfully embarrassing. There are a few more bits of oddities. The best thing about the device is the classy look. It feels rich and responds within a jiffy.
0|4|Nice phone with amazing battery backup and camera quality.. some wrote it heats up.. that is not the case with my phone also it's good to be luke warm as we are approaching winters soon.. to me a phone should be good in battery , screen quality and camera.. it meets all three and I am happy :).. PS : No heating issues so far ;)
0|5|Awesome Handset, Worth in this price, No issue so far, recommend to buy this from FlipKart.com Delivered on next day, good delivery.
0|1|not good becuase play store is not working unable to download any app from that. Even always shows error message.
1|1|Good Phone, Nice strong build , Gets heated only on video calls, Flipkart delivery best , Was delayed by one day.. but none the less fastest than any one. No complaints here. Poor customer service , Had to visit service centre for a minor problem which required a small part replacement and its more than 15 days i am fed up. Shivajinagar(Mi Exclusive service center) Address: MI Exclusive Service Center TVS Electronics Ltd, 1170/21 Revenue Colony Near Shivaji Nagar Head Post Office(Adjacent to Kajale Petrol Pump) Shivaji Nagar Pune 411005 Service Center Phone Number: 020-25534001 Very Very Poor customer service offered and the executives are blunt. think again before you buy. the low cost has some repayments to be done.
1|5|First of all, Flipkart delivered it before the expected date and packaging was also good. Now if I talk about the phone, it's a killer. No other phone can be compared with it in this price range, that's what i believe. There is no heating issue with the phone, it just gets "little" warm while continuously using it for long hours which is normal. It's specialty is its MIUI 6 ROM which works perfectly and it also gets regular updates from time to time. To anyone who is plannng to buy a phone under 15000k, buy Mi4i.
0|3|When I charge the phone, it gets heat in 5-10 minutes and reduce the battery. Please solve my problem soonly.
0|2|Bought Mi4i even after reading lot of Negative reviews from Flipkart. Personally felt cheated & disappointed after found the Phone giving lot of issues. 1) Heating during calls is the worst part. 2) MIUI the customized Android UI in this phone is not stable has too many bugs which will irritate you 3) In low light the Phone will turn blank, or a Message will appear to press the volume and back button together, This troubles the most when you receive a call. 4) The OS uses more than 1GB of the available RAM leaving very less for the apps. 5) The Battery -- the Most frustrating Part, drains like a hell & then the charging takes over 3+ hours. 6) Does not have a notification System even does not notifies that you have a missed call on the home screen. and the list goes on................ Getting adapted to the BUGGY MI4I.. But in my personal review is DO NOT BUY its not worth spending your money on the buggy version. Even if they give an update to make it stable why should the user spend his money on buying this piece of CRAP and waiting for their update.
0|5|I am using this phone since a month 1.there is no heating problem. 2.battery backup awesome during normal using. 3.finish quality awesome. 4.light weight 5.easy to operate. 6.slim. best in this price range.
0|4|I see many new phone releasing each day, after doing research and reading different reviews I decided to go for this phone and i tell you its worth to buy. Everything works great.
0|3|I purchased the mobile for android application development. The connection with PC/laptop is not stable even after installing driver.
0|4|I have been using this phone from past four months. My phone navigation key LED not working. Battery back up is ok. Feel shortage of space. Design is awesome. Very light & compact.Camera is very good. I liked the camera the most!! User interface is good. No heating issues with new updates. Overall happy but expected more from phone.
0|5|clean finish.powerfull features. Mi4i is best bet launched by Xiomi in india.In budget and target likes of galaxy range and sony z.camera has great clarity as well.powerfull snapdragon processor.
0|3|The specifications are good on papers and initially the phone will perform at par but once you get the applications installed, the phone would slow down. You would notice lags in performance. Sometimes even the basic app like keyboard gets frozen. The two best things about this phone is its look and it is easy to use with one hand as well. also, the camera is good, but the catch to camera images is that : the pictures taken on camera would look good on phone due to high PPI but once u check it on laptop or PC, you would feel that the quality of picture is average and not brilliant. The phone gets heated up to 53-55 degree Celsius, i even took a screen shot. U can also know the temperature of phone via *#*# 4636 #*#* . Overall the phone is pretty average and if you thing this is low priced, well i would say they played it smartly to fool indians. :)
0|4|Front camera is awesome. Back camera clicks some great ones; but can be much better (Software-wise) Mi-Ui combines looks of iOS and powers the Android underneath. Android Debugging and Development is supported. Heating issue is not there, (after the latest update MIUI6.6.6.0). Look for problems of new update(even if they are stable) before updating. All apps work good Touch could have been better. Overall 4/5
1|5|It was a gift for my friend. I have not used it yet. But he has not complained either. The phone looks impressive. MI user interface isn't as good as the stock lollipop UI.
1|5|I am using this phone from 3 months, battery is long lasting, handling is very smooth, performance is very good.
0|5|i got this product one month ago . good:-1080p display ,441 ppi -13mp /5mp cameras -3010mah battery -design bad :-heating when using 3g or playing games -loudness of speaker is poor for a price rage or around 15k this is the right choice for you .you cannot get this specs on any other phones . display:- the main attraction of this phone is the display . it is better than AMOLED displays . it gives rich color reproduction and sharper image .OGS coating gives life for your images .and corning concore glass gives premium look and protection for the display camera:-13mp camera is just amazing , vivid color and give perfect detail. i compared the camera clarity of this phone with sony z2 (21mp) it was unbelievable the mi4i's camera is better than sony . front camera is okay for 2mp not that much of 5mp camera performance:-snapdragon 615 gives an stunning performance for this device with 2gb ram and 405 graphics media :-again the display is amazing for viewing movies or watching full hd videos it gives a superb clarity of picture with adreno 405 graphics battery :- the battery of this phone is amazing i have charged 100 percentage on morning , at night the battery remains about 60 percentage with average use design:-please dont buy the gray or black color . white is the best . the white and black combination is realy good.. the back panel of this device is not poor quality plastic this is made my poly carbonate premium matte finished cover..@standby time the phone looking great because of the conecore glass and ogs coating conclusion:- you cannot get this pecs on another smartphone under 14k.this phone have some heating issue . but the heating problem is common for all smartphones now .. so you can go with mi4i surely .....thank you (sorry for bad English)
0|5|nice phone,worth money...features and built quality is premium............... very very nice screeen and camera quality product............................................
0|4|Those who are complaining about heating......just update , it will be solved upto about 70%. Its a great phone if SD card is not an issue.
0|4|Very Nice phone. Happy with my order, Smooth interface, Camera is awesome .Nice themes for girls.Speaker is also very good. A good choice for this range of phone.
0|5|The vendor has always kept its promises to deliver the product in time. Just one compliment to the vendor ....... "Awesome"
1|2|Hi ... I brought mi 4i in the month of July 2015.. very first product was faulty and it took more than 7 days to get it replaced. Phone keeps on reminding that you have a china product. Heating is biggest issue and camera starts after ages...so make sure you start the camera well before. flip-kart after sales service is also very poor. I think this is what happens when American business style is applied in India that to for a china product... I would recommend some branded phone at 13K... Disappointed with mi 4i... Good Luck !!
1|4|Mi4i is really good phone. just 1 problem in it and that is it gets heated when you use. but accepting with other features and price heating can be compromised.
0|5|awesome produce from xiaomi, i am using dual 3g sim, very fast connectivity, the camera is awesome!!!!
0|5|Superb phone i used ever.No heating issue at all. Nice configuration in this range i.e amount, camera, storage,mi cloud, back up, sync,battery and much more to love this gadget.
0|5|WONDERFUL PHONE AS PER SPECIFICATIONS. GOT MY PHONE THE VERY NEXT DAY WITH EXPRESS DELIVERY. PRESTINE CONDITION. SCREEN AND TOUCH DISPLAY ARE UNPARALLELED AT THIS PRICE RANGE.
1|4|First of all flipkart service was very good. Now about product. No doubt this mobile has very good and attractive features ,but it is not made for game lovers.It has Heating Issue if you play high end games.Also sometimes it LAGS while doing multitasking. Apart from this every thing fine.
1|2|*** screen panel is changed....i have two xiaomi mi 4i...at a same mark of brightness level.one of xiaomi mi 4i gives vivid color...another gives cheap color...u can see cheapness on the the xiaomi mi 4i box..the (F) marked box of xiaomi is cheap...another was (B)..it was good...thank you..**true review.
1|4|I am using this product since last one month. Slightly heating up when used continuously, talking, browsing or gaming in long. Overall performance is good & satisfactory.
0|4|I don't want to waste time. It was simple and good for normal users, if your are power users this is not for you. go with some other chipset models (say no to 615) Pros: - 1) both Camera's (best in range), 2) Battery (in Balanced mode), 3) display is super Cons: - 1) UI (personally I don't like it) 2) heating problem while playing games 3) Non - Removable battery (for some people it was con) Inbuilt memory - we can go for 32 GB variant also so no problem
0|2|Reported Wi-Fi issue in the Bug reported bunch of time after an updated , till no response. Camera and display are good.
0|4|quite good product true caller is not working proper in it and cemra sometimes hand on, VERY HANDY AND LIGHT WEIGHT
1|4|Good one. Previously I had used SAMSUNG SIII. Comparing both this also have good performance. I had never faced heating issues even using 2hrs of Internet. Worth for Money.
0|4|I purchased this product for my dad. Once again Flipkart Delivery and transition were smooth. And about Mi4i_ It's been a Great phone. very smooth UI with multifuctions. Juz loved it.. :)
0|4|Best Product but some mobiles small-2 problems. i replesed my mobile 2 times. Flipkart best site becouse it's changed my mobiles any problems. My 3rd mobile is much better best mobile.
0|5|at this prices this phone is excellent. spec is also good 13 mp camera gives you best shots processor gives you spped without any hang & cons you can use this phone easily. simpley Best
0|4|MI 4I is good in design, fast performance. MIUI 6 feels good. camera quality is superb. Sometimes it is being heated while charging and talking for a while. Themes donot make you feel superb. its just satisfactory.
0|5|I bought the MI4I on the first day itself on flip kart. It was really awesome. Only problem I found was MIC. It was not audible at all. Findally I found the solution for this and here it is. ....... follow below steps 1.Go to Settings 2.Scroll down until you find "About phone", tap it 3.Scroll down and find "Kernel Version", tap it multiple times (at least 3-4 times). This takes us to "Hardware tests" 4.Now tap on "Speaker PA Calibration Test", this opens up another window with "Calibrate" button 5.Tap on "Calibrate" button this will calibrate the sound system and when it is "pass" you are done. If the calibration fails, stop any application running related with volume like playing song and try again till it is pass. Now play any song and you are booming already! Your sound volume is back to normal. Start booming !
0|1|This is not good for me , I have regular facing the same Issue Since I have purchase this product.heating and hanging Issue with this product
0|1|No long bettery life and heating problum come in any time and internet speed very poor wifi direct not spotted

0|4|Every thing is nice with this mobile but it gets heat when we charge and when we use 3G network. picture quality is also good. It takes too long to recharge the battery. little bit worry with chrome and facebook app. Remaining features is fantastic.
0|3|guys plz..........help me out.How to set contact image? I tried to set contact image for my contact but failed to do.plz help me out.thanks in advance.
0|5|Great camera quality, very fast processor, light weight, charges fast with his own charger, rest 10 on 10 great product
0|5|heard many complaints abt battery draining but without net its giving 2 days and with net 1 day. MIUI OS is too gud. better than Moto G. Camera and display is also very gud.
0|5|Superb looking.. Super Slim and Light Weight.. Full HD display.. Long battery life.. 2gb Ram.. Always remain 1gb free.. Go for it...
0|3|Lots of bugs in software, No proper support. After 1 month use battery charging which was due to software update, when visited MI store they din't have any technical knowledge about that and asked me to submit phone to change battery socket, then i updated software again and problem solved. Then again after 1 month of use phone started crashing continuously which put phone not usable at all, Even can't be backed up so i have to loose my most of the data.
0|4|Overall its a good phone but this phone has two major drawbacks its, no upgrade storage and another is anytime hang status phone. Camera its good, but while continuous on then the camera will go hang status.
0|4|I've been using this phone for 2 months now and I like it...Performance is great and Camera quality is also good...Can be put to good use with a fast 3G connection and battery lasts for one full day which is great.but after the recent update (41 MB) the battery life seems to have dropped a little. Minor heating issue still persists.
0|4|Using this phone for past 2 months and I am really happy with the specs- especially the display(You could experience such frame detailing in samsung phones worth Rs.18000/- only). Cons: Cam is not good as expected - Has got 13Mp, but shows pic quality of 8Mp
1|2|Excellent phone for the price range..super fast while using,excellent pictures and much more Only issues faced is Phone is getting heated after usage which is very uncomfortable .
0|5|Doesn't heat after the software update & bug fixes. Everything is just fine with this phone except the on board memory. 16 GB is too less for a heavy user like me. 32 GB variant will work. Only phone under Rs 15000 price point which plays heavy graphical games like FIFA 15 without lagging. Trust me Front Camera is better than iphone 6 & Galaxy S6. Battery is also good.
1|1|Not happy with this product. I was delivered Mi4i on a Friday and the following Monday, the display started fluttering... tried to reboot the device several times but the problem stayed on. Didn't expect this quality from Xiomi!
0|5|good mobile in recent days with best features and the look of the mobile resembles iphone...0 problems have been faced by me...u can buy this
1|1|I have purchased my MI4I,I was very much excited about having new phone but my excited burst within fifteen days there is lot of lining showing on my display now my phone is at service canter and they are saying they requested for parts and company is not sending parts. I am following up from last 15 days. Don't buy recommended
0|1|A very very poor in battery, very much heating problem, it hangs so much when using games or watching movies... heating problem of phone is very big problem.. if u update it though it will heat and when talking our ears also heat up... when u switch on flach light it heats up within 1 minute no good memory storage, it is 16 gb but usable is only 10.5 GB camera is good but storage is poor... no accessories is available in local market and also no any thing new in box only charge is available.. flipkart return policy is very poor i already tried it to return for 4 to 5 times but i can not get proper answer, too....
1|5|Good experience of Mi4I. Camera beautiful & phone functionality ultimate. It is 16 GB so good enough for normal usage with optimum apps.
0|1|I am writing this review after using this phone for one week. Please read the full review before buying this phone. Cons:- 1.Not even per with any phone in this range in case of performance. First day it played Asphalt 8 smooth, next week it started lagging. It is taking too much time to load any app. And it is taking hell lot of time to boot. 2.Camera is not good, just look good on phone only. 3.MIUI is not good. 4.Battery is also not good as expected as you will except with more than 3000 mAh battery. 5.Browsing is OK but not per with so high config phone which is mi4i. 6.Just 16 GB internal with no external memory, You will get around 10.5 GB in brand new phone, first you will think its enough but after a week you have to take care of single MB of space. Pros:- Phone look and its weight which is very light.
0|5|great product camera resolution is good best product but one problem heating but after update it is less
0|1|i saw in flipkart. They said that it has many good specification . but it is illustion they cheated me . I bought to my brother as a gift ,in first 3 days looks good but after that it geets struck in lock screen and my brother scolded me why you are got me a idiotic phone CONS The graphics is not working i thing so,and it get struck ,then the battery is poor, it very slow compared to any another and there are many cons , only one pros PROS It has a good camera quality
1|4|Good product in this price range. Camera quality is good. only problem is phone generates heat on playing high end games
1|1|I have purchased 2 mi4i products from flipkart .its the worst product ever selling on flipkart.i recommend do not purchase it
0|5|awesome phone,mainly i liked its appearance and its sleek nature.it is also light in weight to handle.totally it is a wort of it to the given price.
0|4|30 day usage Total update is 900MB Look, Design, size, weight, style - very good GENERAL - No hanging probs or heating issues at any point of operation and how speed we use. Free RAM is 800MB with FB,WU and instagram installed. good net speed in 2g, 3g and wifi. MIUI6 Satisfied with inbuilt touch screen lock, torch, data meter, touch screen shot, app manager, bug reporting, mails, players, office. DISPLAY- good, able operate in direct sunlight. Auto adjustment is different for different application, camera, etc... which is good, but looks like a couple of flashing in screen. Status bar is very small with all information. Notification LED helps a lot to differentiate incoming sms,calls,mails,... touch is fast and smooth and single handed BATTERY Average. Holds one day. moderate usage with data on 3 hr browsing, 1 hr calls, 15 min cam, 1 hr music. 2 hour movie takes 40% drop of charge at 30% brightness. 0 - 100 charging needs 2 to 2:30 hrs CAMERA Rear - Really good, good colour, clarity. Satisfied. Manual mode shooting is superb for our requirement. Pics had good details in low light and even picks up dim street lights and covers about 300 meters wide and long details. noise is there. Front - Awesome, Beautify Mode is very nice. Some times pics distorts while moving shot. Video quality and sounds - good MUSIC/Sounds Internal - clear voice good, external - clear , average loudness for rings. Needs to boost ringtones mp3 for better loudness. Vibration is average only. GAMING - Not yet used. Decent delivery by flipkart. Negatives No memory card WCDMA (3G) only option is not given. It should be provided as software update. No head phones
0|3|i am writing this review after 3 week use . first impression - very good , handy , back surface is little slippery but feeling is awesome , (i suggest not to use any extra back cover otherwise u will lost this quality of this phone ). screen- fully satisfied , it has full HD screen, clearity is awesome , with enough colour , since this phone has gorilla glass 3 so u dont need any screen guard. camera - both front and rear camera has very good quality , u can say front camera is made for selfi battery - i found initially that phone get warm during charging but later i dont found this problem again , battery life is good , i m using 3G net whole d day with quite enough remaining battery. memory - it doesnt has any expandable memory ,(xiomi thinks that external memory reduces its performance ,WTF), 16GB memories quite enough for me. rest all function are same like other phone in the same segment . like performance, sound quality, etc. overall you can buy this product its value for money.
0|1|Please solve the issue of phone heating . if we speak for more then 3 mins phone will heat automatically and ear will pain from the so please solve the issue .
1|4|I was reading everywhere about heating problem of this phone. But luckily I am not facing this problem. Awesome gadget to use with daily routine things like fb, whatsapp, linked, TOI in etc. but no gaming. Go for it if you don't play games on mobile devices though i have not checked mobile with any of the game.
1|1|I purchased Mi 4i mobile 1 month back and it has started hanging. Camera is not working properly. It closes after sometime and I have to restart it. Internet stops working after half day and again I have to restart the mobile to get it function properly. "Sim 1 removed" error displays whenever I am travelling. I haven't installed much apps in it, even then it hangs. I am in doubt that should I install more new apps or not. Kindly, let me know If you will exchange the mobile.
1|1|Please .... please don't purchase this shit phone.... I just trapped..... [1] Main problem is over heating.... thus this phone have one additional feature that we can use this phone as iron box. [2] Its pattern screen lock is not working. Whenever I am tring to set the pattern screen lock the setting itself is closing and showing a message "Unfortunately setting closed" [3] I have registered these complaints in MI customer care, that peoples are not at all responding.....
1|4|Using mi 4i a week long.A good configuration mobile by Xiaomi.Camera is too good compare to other mobiles and Process also good. But the unsatisfied thing is Heating of mobile.But u could not give the solution for the heating because of the configuration and processor.Even every smart mobiles facing heating issues noW a days.So Don't worry about that. Overall good mobile for this price.
1|5|Good Product return and exchange policy not good, which announced by the flipkart, When ever purchased any item be careful.
0|4|It's a good mobile and delivers what it claims.Being a chinese company Mi products are a class apart smart looks ,loaded with features and are quality products .The Mi4i is light weight easy to handle and has a processor which can run multiple apps at the same time, battery is huge and can be used over a day even with decent usage.Camera is great but it do struggles in low light but all in all this mobile is worth for 13k i m pretty happy with this its a must buy phone better than samsung and htc mobiles worth 20k
0|5|Just go for it blindly ...... Simply Beautiful and good perfomance... Really a worth product for 13K....
1|5|I purchased this cellphone before 3 month, I'av not found any heating problem, hardly you'll find mobile with such features within this price range. camera quality was awesome. I suggest to go for this.at the end worth buying.
0|4|Simply great product by xiaomi. using from last 2 months. No complaint from my side.Because of new updates its very nice to use. I love it very much. only one thing should be there in updates is its sound.I will be happy if Xiaomi enhance its sound in next updates.
0|2|Better go for Moto G 3rd Gen. Mi4i has still got intolerable heating issues. The battery drains out quickly and the cam quality is average. Despite 2gb RAM still feels sluggish when compared to Moto G 2nd Gen. So overall I would suggest new buyers to AVOID going for Mi4i.
0|1|It has been a while since i have purchased this phone and it is not at all up to the mark. It hangs a lot and get heated very soon, even when I am not using the phone.
0|2|Have to 2 phones withing a gap of a month for my relatives. One of them is working fine but the other one has developed front camera problems. Googled it and found its a common issue. when you turn on the front camera the picture starts to become grainy and slowly covers the whole screen until nothing is visible. Have requested a return of the product. Otherwise overall the phone looks good light and performance is good enough for any day to day browsing, watching videos etc.Satisfactory battery backup. Much better when compared to my nexus 5. Display is good speakers are loud. Havnt tried 4G but 3G works pretty well.
0|4|yes... its super good looking and weightless .... thanks to flip cart for your safe and fast delivary.... those who are looking for a new trend please choose mi4i without much delay.... it will not make u unhappy... i like it very much.... thanks to xiomi the company presented this kind of stylish phone.....
0|5|good camera both front and back slim and light weight good built quality good display long life battery
1|4|Ordered on 14th July, Delivered on 22nd July. So this review is after a weeks moderate usage. I previously owned a Moto G 2nd Gen, and this does not turn out to be an upgrade over that. Infact, despite an additional 1 GB RAM, the fone feels slightly slower, mind you, only slightly. The handset does NOT get as hot as the others have been saying on this forum! It gets warm on heavy game usage, but i found the same case to be with Moto G as well. Pros: 1. Decently fast for a mid range phone 2. Good call clarity. 3. Battery life is good. Lasts full 24 hrs with 3G and moderate gaming, heavy phone usage. Cons: 1. Would have preferred a handsfree set to have come along with the set 2. Speaker volume is too low, you might miss out on calls sometime if you are in traffic 3. Available RAM for user is as low as 850-900 MB out of 2GB! Causing the games to at times to skip a frame or two. 4. No extendable memory. Again, of the 16 GB advertised memory, only about 10.3GB is available for user. Too less? I think so. Would I buy this fone again? Umm....only maybe.
0|5|very nice and super phone money valued model camera was excelente touch good looking awesome i give a 5 star rating
0|1|Screen failure including no display/abnormal display. And Poor Customer Service Support from Flipkart.
0|4|It is working good but I had replaced Motherboard after 75 days with free of cost.remains very good - performance wise excellent.
0|3|Call disconnect, hangs a lot , not happy with this product from Xiomee....Redmi 1s was much better in terms of performance.....Camera is awesum...
0|5|This is the best phone i ever had,the best display and processer speed even faster than nokia lumia's and apple's i phone 6.
0|5|The Mi4i is a very competitively priced phone and knocks all other phones in this price segment out of the park. It has a full HD display and has a very premium fell to it. It has a polycarbonate uni body with a magnesium alloy frame. The features on MIUI 6 are very useful and the phone as a whole is a bang for the buck. Great buy.
0|4|Awesome phone. Looks smaller than my earlier mi 3, but dual 4g sim is really awesome. Front cam is really better than the mi 3. a little bit heating issue is there, however it happens to all the sleek phones i guess.
0|2|Using since last one month. In-spite of Upgrading the software of 800 MB, Heating is the greatest disadvantage of this phone.
0|5|Redmi mi4i is now very very very very fatest mobile available in the market..its display is amazing touch and very reality for touching... speed of internet is very good and also for downloading.. another great advantage for redmi mi4i battery back is nearby 2days...normal internet usage nearby 1.5 days...its caution 3150 mah battery.. amazing battery backup...pertty good... its worthble for 13000... dont miss it...wwwwwoooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww performance...good good good goodddddddddddddddddd..........................
1|4|It's been a month using the Mi4i and the phone is functioning properly. No such unwanted lags Noticed. I installed fifa 2015 and it is running smoothly with little bit of heating on the back but it's normal in these conditions. Every phone has its maximum capability and do not expect this as your laptop or xbox.
1|2|When I Order this phone, I saw an offer of get 500 coupon code free, but still didn't get any coupon. for phone, phone is awesome.
0|4|Even though performance of the phone cant meet the hardware specification on papers but still its good phone with the price tag. Well recommended phone for avg phone users. Battery charges soon compare to other 3000mh batteries, battery come for 1.5 day for avg use. Best part is with the selfi camera. Rear camera is above avg. Display is stunning. Apps like Facecbook, Whatsapp will load in a flash. Overall happy with phone.
0|1|PHONE HEATS SO MUCH USES SO MANY PHONES BUT THIS IS WORST SOOO MUCH HEAT LIKE A PAN YOU CANT BEAR TRUST ME
0|5|The quality of Touch Screen is the first appearance which you would feel and layered with MIUI 6 (continues updates for fixing the issues as and when identified) is making topping on the Thin Choco brownie. Music lovers need to tie-up there head phone for this device as only & only concern is low sound volume. 5 on 5 for all added feature and best battery life for one full day even if your Service Provider (network) condition is not up to mark. Grab this or you can check for 32GB variant if you keep high number of app and files. Just Go for Mi...
0|1|this phone is just a headache nothing else. and the tag line is"Mad India four (for) India. I suggest you all not to buy this phone. it is value for money but at the same time you will get what you pay for it.
1|1|worst phone ....go fr asus zenfone 2 or micromax yurekha or xpress2 ths phone hangs and heats like hell
0|1|Hi, One month back i bought this mobile, this mobile SAR value is very high, if it is high value you will get headache and ear pain.. am getting headache and ear pain from last two weeks, so request you to please don't buy this mobile. '
0|5|Awesome service, Love you Flipkart happy to buy this my MI touch was not responding sometimes got new piece within 2 days
0|4|I bought this phone on flash sale and got it delivered on 20th June.I did not see the phone before purchasing in real.Once I got the phone,was(and is) very impressed with the design,build and display.Everything is awesome except for some issues and drawbacks. Pros: 1) Great design 2) Excellent display 3) Pocket friendly 4) Smooth Performance 5) Beautiful camera ( only outdoor and in good light conditions) 6) MIUI is awesome.So many hidden features and it surprises you while using.Every feature is there which you think of. Cons: 1) No expandable memory and 16GB is too less.Often has to move content from phone. 2) Heating up and it will be too hot to handle to speak over call after playing a game like Asphalt 8. 3) Twice I got speaker issue.Buzzing noise.Went away by itself. 4) "No SIM card" issue thrice till now.Need to take the SIM tray out and plug it back in.Then it works fine. In brief,I am very impressed and love this phone.I only wish memory was more or expandable and phone wont heat up.Apart from these two major issues, I can live with others.There are more pros than cons.
0|1|Discovered another bug (has to be abug!!). took me a while to reproduce:Whenever there is a missed call - the call history shows the missed call normally.If you dial back on the missed call, it goes through fine (doesnt matter if the call is answered or not).Now, if there is a missed call from the same number, the call shows asreject instead of missed. There are no notifications etc. [there is no manual rejection of any call in the process, i.e., by sliding up the red icon when the call comes].Same behavior if that number has been dialled previously some time back and you get an incoming call that gets missed. the call will always showas reject until the callercalls again and the call is missed.I have tried it over and over again, and it is definitely a bug! Attached screenshots showing the same behaviour. Go ahead and try it.Mods, devs, MI reps and all users - pls go ahead and try this!!! i have played around with all settings and cant figure this one out. Also there are automatic brightness issues. Auto wifi on issue very low volume.
1|1|Touch sensitivity is not great.. phone gets heated up big time..from the performance wise its kind of good.. for the money what we have invested you are getting a decent configuration.. I see a little lag in touch sensitivity..
1|5|A phone value for the money..... ultimate display, processor and camera!!!! loving it.... refocus option ( can customize focus any image after click) # MIui platform has customised anderoid - it lead to increase many other option without installing additonal app like - Themes etc. # No heating problem - as with 1.4 ghz process and 2 gb ram and 16 gb rom, little bit hit with high processor work ( can be handled easily : ) ) # Very light phone and made to handle with one hand easily...
0|5|I bought this phone in June 2015. Front camera was not working well after few days of buy. I requested replacement and after the procedures (taken 15 days) flip kart approved my replacement request. Now i got replacement. Since then it is working fine. I appreciate the effort from flip kart for resolving my issues. The phone display resolution, the camera clarity, sound clarity, the processor speed are best among other phones in this price range. Battery backup time is good. In my suggestion this is best purchase option if you planning to buy a new smart phone of 12000 to 15000 price range.
0|2|Internet speed in this phone is very very slow. It is worst phone that i have ever purchased in this range. I need to replace it now.
0|5|best phone for the price offerred...got worried about the heating problem aftr reading previous comments but u cn buy it with confidence...once u done with the update provided by mi, u will not find any such issue.... go for it blindly....... only con battry backup is not as expected...... will stand only fr a day otherwise best product.... flipkart service is best...i ordered the phone with one day delivery and got the same as described.......five stars :)
0|1|I have to think many time to buy any other product here NOW. I liked very much this phone but i was so dis pointed now.
1|1|Mi 4i is ok then other's but hanging problem acquired,play-store not working properly incoming cal will be reached mobile but we didn't attn the call
0|1|Very bad experience with this Chinese phone. 1. Battery does'nt even last 12 hrs (I have installed the new update). 2. Camera is average at the best. 3. You can barely hear the phone ring. 4. Everytime I have to restart to connect to internet. Don't buy this piece of crap and waste your hard earned money.
0|5|Real Vale For Money. Awesome DSLR Quality photos when shot outdoors. Indoors OK, not adorable, but better than all other mobiles in this price bracket. True color representation. 95 percent for mi4i while Iphone 6 is just 72 percent accurate. Well I don't use the phone for gaming. So no comments for that. But I use it for emails, whatsapp, Documents, Pdfs, PPT, accounts software, and most pro apps including music composing etc. Battery too stays easily for a day. Only con i can remember is it has no external sd card expansion. Nothing else to say. So go for it!
0|1|worst battery performance I have ever seen. Excessive heating problem, yes You can make omlete on the phone. Not recommended. Loosing faith in flipkart because of products like this.
0|1|This mail is to inform the bad experience i am facing with the hand set purchased through Flipkart. Phone become not responding continuously. Now a days the Touch screen facility is also bad. Because of this bad quality, lock pattern becoming an headeache as it cann’t be able to open.
1|1|the product is good but the Customer Support has given me a big headache. I am facing big time issues in getting it replaced. Have got a mail that they will update me by 27th. But still there is no call or any other support from the team. And each time while calling Customer Support, I am getting a never ending 24 HOUR revert back information which i have not got since more than 120 hours. Donno how much more i will have to wait to get my product replaced. Would request an immediate attention from HIGHER Management if they really want to support us. PLEASE PLEASE HELP. When contacted today, have got a revert that despite receiving the original product for replacement the processing will not happen before 31st July. This is getting into a nightmare for me and require immediate attention.
1|1|Last week i have received Mi4i. the mobile having excellent Clarity and camera ! But Over Heating while Data Service On. My EAR Burned within Two Days Usage..because Overheating!!! i will raise return request to flipcart!! surprised i got SMS.( within 48 hours product adviser will call and find out your issue).But4 days over no one is contact me..Only Get Apology from flipcart. Your Return request rejected!!! PHONE OVER HEATING !!!POOR BATTERY BACKUP!! WONT GET WARRANTY!! ONLY APOLOGY FROM FLIPCART!!!
0|5|I read many reviews that the phone gets heated. My recommendation is to update the phone which is available in the updater section of 860 MB. Pros: 1. Superfast phone. it has 2 GB ram. 2. No need of any third party app for virus and cleaning. all are included. 3. the build quality is superb. 4. The display is very rich. It has ambient- sunlight display which helps using it in day-time. 5. The music is clear and crisp. For music lovers, this is a must-buy in this range. 6. the phone looks very Good. 7. No need of any launchers. You can just add themes from Mi Store and have fun. 8. PC Connectivity is mind blowing. 9. The phone has very less chances of getting damaged or any part getting displaced as it is a single bar phone. it has no openings. To insert sim, you just need the pin inside the box and nothing else opens. 10. The camera is best in class. True 13 Megapixel. 11. In the picture and youtube videos, the phone looks blackish but when you open it, it is sort of greyish dark blueish. which enhances its looks. There are many more pros's. Cons: 1. Missing earphone. but tell me how many of you use the orignal earphone provided with the phone? 2. We get usable memory 10.80 GB which is pretty less. I could not find any other cons. So guys.. Don't wait. Grab it.
0|5|Rating is 4.5 Look and feel, check. Screen resolution check. Performance, check. Front and rear camera, double check. Only con is the sound. Calls on speaker mode is not understandable.
0|5|Mi4I is a revolution. Phone is heating less then my previous mobile e7mini while playing asphalt 8.....
0|5|good camera, good performance, good screen experience, good gaming performance, ok battary, only limitation saw is the restrictedt 16 GB memory but overall too god the for the price offered giving 8.5/10 for the overall performance and 10.1/10 for the price
0|3|To those who have bought this phone ... Definitely it has a good camera , display , processor speed. But with every technology comes a hiccup. This particular phone Mi4i has a tactical problem. This phone first of all works fine when its ok , but when it rebooting continuosly consider it as half dead. Dont know about the after sale servicing issues. But guys for a limited period usability its okay. Not for long because dont forget it its Xiaomi Communications another chinese company. I personally feel that 13000 for a phone like this is waste.
0|3|AFTER USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH I HAVE TO SAY THAT , THIS A GOOD PHONE WITH ALL THE FEATURES COMPRESSED IN A BUDGET SEGMENT BUT IT IS A CHINA MOBILE WITH MANY DEFECTS LIKE HEATING ,SYSTEM LAG , BUT ITS A GOOD NOT THE BEST I MEAN ALL FEATURES ARE COMPRESSED . YOU CAN GO FOR THIS FOR YOU HAVE TO ADJUST TO THIS AND DONT SUFFER .ANY WAY ITS A CHINA PHONE
0|5|easy to access specially love the update feature which makes your phone performance unto date. Highly recommended.
0|2|After one month charging problem some time heating problem also .when you play game and taking snapshot also ...
1|5|No point in discussing technical details, in short vale for money product, good quality provided you dont have very high expectations.
0|5|So this is the best phone in modes of Budget and also in the modes of Features ..but not in when u open the box..Because they only provide the Charger...not even Earphone and Cover is provided with the BOX. The gets hott..many a times... But Still THE BEST.
0|1|A lot of heating. Can't hold for long near ears. It burns. Descending ringtones to nonaudible state causes missing of calls, alarms, timers etc. Not worth buing. There is always a fear and anxiety.
0|1|MI4i Camera replaced after I bought mobile within a month. Front camera has some issues. Quality must have to be improved.
0|5|Phone is very nice. All should take it. It doesn't heat so much. Best phone in 10000 to 20000 thousand
0|5|I'm using this phone from about a month now. I have previously used Mi3 and Redmi 1S as well. I must say this phone is the best in the current Xiaomi line up of phones. The most impressive features: - Great Build Quality, Form factor and Feel. This is the first thing you'll notice once you hold this phone in hand. Its very sleek and feels very reassuring - Gorgeous FHD screen. Next amazing thing you'll notice once you switch on the phone. Sharp and Bright. - Superb Camera Start taking few photos, the app and the hardware is really optimized for best image quality - Great Battery Life After one month's usage and few firmware upgrades the batter performace is greatly improved - Dual 4G SIM slot Only let down for me was the performance compared to Mi3. Maybe future firmware upgrades will address this issue.
0|5|I think this is one of the best phone in the current market, but i still feel that ppl go for bigger display phones, not knowing anything about phone's PPI and other hidden features. Mi4i has better Pixels per inch when compared to any other phones within the range.
0|3|Pros 1. Sleek design 2. Excellent camera both front and rear 3. Great Image quality 4. Great display. Experience at full brightness colors are so vivid. Cons 1. Heating issue. Phone heats on multitasking and while watching videos 2. Too many settings. Not easy to search, I am still exploring settings.
0|5|It's a Premium Mobile phone @ the cost of ordinary mobile phone,indeed. The only thing i didn't like is IMIE sticker sticked right @ the center of the back of mobile. Features wise i'm completely satisfied.
0|1|Phone is having 2 many problems . 1. Charging Port problem . 2. Hanging Problem . 3. Heating Problem. 4. Speaker problem. This is the major issue.
1|1|I bought this phone only as per quality standard set by Xiomi. But this time I am really disappointed. This phone has too many problems. First and foremost is the speaker. The volume is so low that its not audible most of the time. Second is the heating problem. The phone gets warm while using and charging. Third problem I am facing is the battery. They have made a wonderful screen. But if we use the screen in full brightness mode then battery get exhausted very early.
0|5|first i thought xiomi phones are not good to use but after i got mi 4i i changed all my concepts. the best hand set i ever brought - good quality and good performance, i brought it after comparison with other handsets. this is the best one in this price really awesome, and also it is the real chinese now indian apple i phone i have some complications when i received the handset because it hav no display but after contacting with mi and flipkart for repalcement they helpmed me to resolve the problem. the problem is not with the set because of my ignorence of operating the set. now i familiarise with most of the applications its simple. first u have some difficulties in operating but after 4 days of usage i really love this handset. really awesome. thanks mi for coming india. and thanks flipkart for familiarise this phone to this world. and for the extended support after sales
0|5|I received the handset almost 12 days ahead of the set delivery. Thank you Flipkart. I am happy with the phone, great display, very sleek to hold and great functions.
0|1|Mi4i mobile set is a very bad quality mobile. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOBILE SET. It is excessively heating during charging and also during its operations such as talk, camera modes etc.Some times re-charging of power is possible only after re-starting mobile. Its software is not stable, hanging frequently, some settings changing automatically. Suddenly its color, contrast & brightness changed to black & white negative film mode, and not restoring back to its original settings in spite of refreshing, rebooting & re-starting this mobile. It is a great cheating of Chinese company. A BAD PRODUCT COMPARED TO ITS PRICE. NEVER SUGGEST OTHERS TO PURCHASE IT.
1|1|Xiaomi is using great marketing strategy by adopting registration system thus fueling in artificial demand. The company should instead focus on the quality of products that are released & not just on offering higher-end specs at a lower price. Seems like the company never test check their products before putting out in the market. Almost all Xiaomi phones have series of problems, most important being the heating one .The after-sales service is poor too. The technical team at one of the centers(S.G. Infotech, Borivali) I visited are severally incompetent. Here are some pros & cons: Pros: Good build quality MiUi is simple & nice to use Great camera Cons: Heats up even while performing day-to-day tasks Poor after-sales service Don't get tempted by the value-proposition this phone offers. Instead, go for a decent brand!
1|5|The MIUI is the best part and the batter backup in balanced mode is kind of keeping the phone up for more than 2 days. The strong community is having a big database of free themes. I don't play games, so have not tried that but besides that the phone is living with 5 stars in all respects. The only thing that i see as improvement area is the settings view where the text is aligned to extreme left, they could have left some space there.
0|4|Nice phone to buy. All features are good. Updation process also does not take more time. Superb, Too Good.
0|5|1) Charging is an issue. I used original charger at home, Car charger while driving and Power Bank in case battery not able to survive beyond 10 hrs. When you switch from 1 type of charger to another, you have to re-boot he phone else it wont charge. 2) My corporate mails require minimum 8 digit PIN where Mi4i supports only 4 digit PIN. Only workaround is to use password instead of PIN but the pain is the small layout to enter password on locked screen.
0|5|Good Phone with Smart Options At Affordable Price...! 1. Front camera - Awesome 2. Rear Camera - Litlle Laggy 3. Touch - Good 4. Sound Quality - Moderate 5. User Experience - Good 6. Hardware Keys - Quite uncomfortable at times
1|4|product is so cool in use but network seaching is issue. overall product is good. in 12999 this is good product
0|4|I am writing this review after using phone for a month. Pros: Look and feel is very nice performance is very good battery backup is ok. Display is awesome touch is smooth No lags/hang observed. Cons: Phone heats up while playing game (starts heating after 10 mins of play..) But there is new update is available for heating issue. Conclusion: At this budget this is awesome phone.. Go for it.
0|4|Best buy in this price list. It is a must buy . Good speed , no lags , super cam , perfect looks. Just bought in two days by Flipkart , as always they do :)
0|4|Superb quality and blazing fast. quality feel and great VFM. Best phone in the range. Have bough t two and am extremely happy post three months as well with performance.
0|4|at this price segement the phone is really great , and the buit quality is superb it dnst feel like ur holding a plastic piece in ur hand,, well camera cud be more beter but its good. remainig all the stuff is perfectly emerged into the mobile , one can easily satisy with this phone, and most of the FAQ was abt d phone heating wch havent faced even in my continuous 1hr of usage it was quite normal . don need to step back of taking this phone.
0|3|I have purchaged this product a month back and started using it after a week of purchage. Phone looks good and peformance also so cool. Camera pics, videos looks awesome. Suddenly, Battery drying like anything. 60% battery discharged overnight without any mobile data or wifi or phone calls. Not sure whats happening.... Is battery replaceble?
0|3|good display, good camera cool features like auto brightness adjustment security etc. hope heating issue is resolved in later version.
0|4|have been using android from a long time,,, was planning to grab an iphone.I had almost stopped loving android when Mi4 was launched.. picked from flipkart and now all goes well. Mi 4i is the best phone to select in this price range. Satisfied with the performance. supports games like asphalt and nfs which a very few phone does... Gets slightly hot near the camera section but acceptable... built... solid looks.. cool platform,interface .. awesome battery.. quite good performance .. reliable can go for it... deserves 5 star in the budget..!!!
1|4|all given specification is working very good but only one draw back when operating some time more becoming heating thats it rest of functionalities is very good
0|5|Previously I was addicted to a flagship mobile of Samsung in Android sector. But Samsung galaxy S6 edge disappointed alot. As I am waiting for Samsung galaxy Note 5 to be announced and lunched in August this year I am using this mobile. One word, I truly impressed and astonished.. Its beautiful, handle everything very smoothly. I had some issues with UI coz from past 5years I was a user of Sammy. Xiaomi Nailed it...
0|1|It has a lot of issues to name a few, any app that requires a 6 digit pin authentication will not work with this phone. For some reason the phone just does not allow more than 4 digits to be entered. Now all of a sudden it wont play anything on the speaker. and it stopped just like that. Neither did it fall, no did I spill water on it, it just stopped. a lot of other smaller issue cropping up as days progress.
1|1|Camera - Awsome! Browsing - The Worst! Battery - Average! Not an interesting mobile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1|4|i like this phone too much. the camera of this phone is better. but the main thing is that its never hanged sticll now from using one months of this mobile.battery backup is also nice u can use full day without any problem.
0|4|mi4i has amazing display..slim design bt the thing i dislike is it doesn't have external memory which is very bad.so it makes phone laging in performance when gone full.it is true that device get heated but not at that level,but can compromise with this..the front cam is amazing but primary cam is not as good as 13mp...this could be best mobile when xiaomi provide external memory slot...
0|3|This phone is nice with an excellent camera. It's light weight gives it an edge over other competitors. However so far I have only come across with two problems. Firstly, it takes alot of time to charge especially if one is charging and using the phone simultaneously. And also gets discharged in a much faster pace when compared with other handsets of same range. Secondly it gets very hot within five minutes of usage.
1|5|I have purchased this mobile. Best product at very low prices. Camera is very good. But unfortunately my phone stolen.
0|5|Best cell phone so far in this range, heat issues is common in high speed clocking processors even galaxy s6 gets heated while gaming and internet being extensively used. Thumps Up for this product. Cheers !!!
0|4|Major cons that I observed after purchase: -No earphone along with phone nor screen guard / cover. -They promised for freebies but I haven't yet got and its around 2 months. -Some time It didn't respond to charge at all and I need to restart it. -One of my friend was having problem that while opening some apps it just hangs. -After blocking data usages for some apps they still use the data,only MI knows why? Major Pros: -Its look is just awesome. -Front camera is just amazing,all my friend uses this for selfie. -Screen is very clear. -UI is also very good. -Battery lasts quite long enough. I will try to update the list with time.
0|5|Awesome Phone in this Price..Display is Awesome ...Fall In love with this ... Fully laminated Corning® Concore™ glass ...only one layer glass ..touch awesome .. Speed best ... U can compare this with I phone 6 .. I f you have issue with size ..go for 32 GB launching 28th July ...
0|1|Each & every moble wil get the best quality of headsets from company... but they hav not provided the headsets with the mobile... very bad thing in reputation of MI 4 i....
0|1|Even in idle condition, the phone it getting discharged on its own with no GPS, internet connectivity ON. Every 4 hours it discharged to zero.
0|5|most amazing phone, i ever had... there is no heating problem after the update... camera quality superb... front camera also superb... just buy this beauty...
1|4|The display and build quality is awesome as expected of a Mi phone. But the phone itself lags a bit. Choppy animations and skipped frames. My Mi3 feels more fluid and responsive compared to this phone. I wouldn't have chose this over Mi3/Mi4 if not for the dual sim option.
0|3|This phone is good but sound quality is not up to the mark. Camera is good , phone is slim. phone is faster than the Samsung phone. i am using it its good phone. Battery backup is similar to the samsung one. Company told that the battery backup will be good but is it is same as the Samsung one.
0|1|This phone gets heated up with 5 mins wifi usage. You can also use it as a heater during winter. If heating is not a problem, this phone might be bought. I made a mistake buying this.
1|2|Pros: Affordable Dual Sim Phone with 2 GB RAM Good Look and Feel Nice Screen Clarity Cons: Processor is not that good (Mi3 is much better) Phone Speaker for Calls not audible sometimes further sometimes there are sim detection problems that only corrects when engage airplane mode and disengage it or restart the phone
0|4|Great features. But it lags big time in one area: VOLUME. Too low volume. speaker volumn is worst you can expect. Other than that its perfect. If volumn would have been better, I would have given 5 start
0|5|Great phone. Like the camera. very good. Phone works really well and looks good and stylish. Worth for 13,000 RS. Can buy. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
0|3|Mobile is good.. but its getting bit heat up and crap thing is that.. We cannot access few apps when we are connected to mobile internet and I tried all the setting still the same!!!!!!!!!! I hate this feature in Xiaomi!!!
0|1|This phone worked fine for 1 month but then once battery drained to 0% and it didn't turn up again. i tried charging it for 2-3 hours but it didn't switch on. Bad Experience..:(
0|3|Pros: Value for money, excellent specs Cons: Heats up like hell - even in case of a few minutes of internet usage, 32 GB is now being released almost at the same price :( Based on my usage for about a week now. Battery lasts a day with about an hour's internet usage (Wifi/4G)
0|3|While checking the mail in the browser i have found that there is problem in the time zone unable to correct it.Also device heat while playing game & while talking,
0|1|I got this phone last week. The first piece which I got was defective, got it replaced in 3 days. The second piece was also not proper I was unable to use mobile data. Mobile data was not working. I had to go to the service center and get it fixed. Too much heating.
0|1|this phone is so heating while calling & use internet battery back up not good, network problem, so plz dont buy this product
0|4|Its a really gud phone.... sound quality - Sound quality is very good camera - amazing cameras both back and front very light phone battery- the battery is OK OK not that gud ...... ful charged phone can last for about 24 hrs with moderate usage. looks-- the phone looks quite chic. processor-- The processor is nothing great bt its above average.
1|4|Product is good and works perfectly wiothout any issues at all. Pretty fast. After some days i got a minor fault in teh phone that it was not charging at all. Xiomi is having service centers only in metro cities only. Luckily its there in Pune. They took 9 Wroking days just to change the small part of the phone, pathetic. Giving 4 star due to service center availability and the support provided. rest all works pretty fine.
0|5|best product i have ever used .. much batter then yureka and lenovo k3 note ... batter quality and very nice display camera quality is awesome battery working almost 2 days with full time 3g data on...
1|2|Heating Effect Quick batery discharge although it is 3120 mAH. faced problem in camera Audio speaker is sound is also low. Contacted flipkart to refund the amount.But,they refused it. No Refund facility is available for Electronic Items. Faced lot of problem
0|5|Superb product. I think this is undoubtably the best phone at this price. I am using this phone since three months. Awesome Delivery. Got the phone within two days
0|5|Light weight, handy, Power-fuel battery, Excellent-unmatchable-high resolution Display, Amazing MIUI with lots of exciting things to explore, Extra ordinary Camera (Both) and ... Boom- what a perfect sound output- Best ever (You have to purchase Headphones, i have I-ball Univo Headset- cheap as 350rs, but more than it worth), Good connectivity for 4G, 3G and clear voice calling. I waited and purchased Grey 1 month earliear, so far excellent experience. Received UI updates, never heated, never hanged. loved it.
0|5|Good backup time, excellent sound quality and over all finishing looks like a phone of around rs. 10 to 12k
0|4|Nice camera nice phone in budget sound quality is nice speed is quite good look is also nice, very handy phone
0|5|HELLO GUYES,i am writing this review after using each and every function of mi4i,i just want to tell this phone is out of the world in 13k series,camera is stunning,very clear and sharp image,very stylish & slim.i just say go for it...IT IS FULL PAISA WASOOL.
0|5|1. Best HD Screen compared to iPhone 6. 2. Camera is awesome. 3. Build Quality very nice. 4. Little heating is there same as all other high configured mobiles, but comparatively Mi 4i is less. If you will use a stylish theme back cover than you will not all feel. 5. Best for Money 6. You can use it for next 3 year as its configuration will support all next generation mobile applications.
0|3|Phone's dual tone flash not working properly..with flash on mode camera gives photos with red tints, minor software bugs too...
1|2|Though, this phone is big hit!!! Unfortunately, 1. Heats even on 4-5 minutes of the call. 2. Doesn't stay long for a day even if you do not play games. 3. No SD card support. so limited scope. Unexpected from MI. They must work around it.
0|1|in short - over heating, camera lag, poor battery. only thing good about it was look n feel. returned to flipkart
0|5|MI4i is a great phone, camera is just awesome. delivered within 1 day. with great packaging. recommend for all. Thank you
0|5|Friends Battery Backup id really awesome. We got 48 hours battery backup with play game candy crush. little bit heating issue but manageable. Camera Quality is superb both selfy and rear camera nice one thanks...
1|1|I have great admiration for Xiaomi as a company till now, Two instances in the recent past has made me doubtful. I have purchased the Mi4i for a colleague of mine, ending up getting not one but 2 faulty pieces. At the same time there are so many fake mi pistons going around the market. If this continues, the level and speed that Xiaomi came to fame, will be the same speed it loses it. I hope the MI team and flipkart look into the issue. Regards, Dhruv
0|3|all the features are good except the battery is getting over heated and the space which is provided for storage is not sufficient. Need to provide external storage so as to have this product as one of the best one....
0|3|Screen : Display quality is good, readable in sunlight Battery : Weakest point, I hardly get a day of backup, that too with minor use (No gprs, WiFi, web browsing). Major culprit seems to be MIUI(software) and screen(hardware) Sound: Sound is a little on lower side. OS: MIUI looks sleek, but also buggy. Many times while exiting using back button from an app, it goes into a circular loop and then keeps switching among previously opened apps. CPU: I tried Asphalt 8 with performance mode on and screen brightness set to full, phone stuttered during race and got heat up so much, it got uncomfortable to hold.
0|3|Phone heats a lot, still after updating with new OS update claiming to keep your phone cooler and again battery doesn't last long
1|5|So far so good - using it for last 1 month. No overheating problem as such - i felt it heated as any other octa core heated but not as much if you can make an omellete on it. It also heated during charging and thats too normal. Cons: Radiation is high. Indian Govt has put a highest limit of 1.6 W/Kg and this device has the exact 1.6W/Kg. I doubt if anyone have verified it though. anyhow - the Iphone-6 also has a radition level of 1.599 W/Kg ;)
0|4|All are superb except the front camera. The quality is good but i dont know whether it is a bug or hardware problem now its really weird.
0|5|To everybody who has even a remote plan of buying it.. JUST GO FOR IT.. its an awesome phone i own one .. and boy i am soo happy with it the overheating problem is not a problem at all.. its actually only noticeable while gaming.. The display is really vibrant .. i wasn't able to see the pixel grid even under a magnifying lens :D The performance is solid.. even handles high end games with ease.. AND BOY THE CAMERA IS A KILLER.. the macro and bookeh effects the mi camera offers makes the picture look like it was shot using a DSLR camera.. no kidding.. it is awesome The MIUI is also really good..really fluid and completely hiccup free The 16 gb was the only thing i was skeptical about.. but actually 16 gb was more than enough... and the USB OTG takes care of the rest of the memory needs.. so.. the bottom line is...JUST GO GET IT its better than any other phone in this price range.. and btw i dont have any connection with Mi other than that i am a really really satisfied customer :D
0|5|i buy this mobile 1 month ago and till now it works excellent.There is no heating problem.front camera is awesome better than back camera.
0|1|=>Heating Issue. =>Sometime it is giving problem while mounting USB, not being detected. =>Music player is not playing mp3 songs. =>And for most of the issues the representative ask me to restore the factory version. That means making backup than restoring it again and again. That's really IRRITATING. Note:- Even after getting the trouble shoot the problem is not resolve.
0|4|awesome phone with awesome specialty like 2Gb Powerfull ram and 16GB internal Memory (i think enough for Normal person).
0|3|I ordered this product on 09/07/2015 and got it on 16/07/2015. There was some delay in despatch. Pros The phone is good looking. Good battery back up- last a day without wifi and game. The screen is good and visible even in sunlight. Operated with latest android. 5 inch screen is good enough to surf the net and see the video Cons No additional data card be allowed. You have to manage with 16gb internal memory. you can not open the back of the phone to open the battery. The price is high in case of a Chinese phone. You can get this feature in Infocus 530 with 11000INR I will update my review after one week of use.
1|4|Nice fone but there is little bit lagging.It have 1 gb ram but 1200 mb is consuming by system ,this is very bad .It should be fast as it have 2 gb ram
0|5|Mi 4i ..The Superb phone.... The Service of flipkart is also very good.... I have no problem at all with this peice.
0|1|too much of heating. wast of money don't purchase this. camera is not up-to mark. wast of money. heating issues. with in five min heating like boil milk.
0|5|I have received my phone before time than estimated delivery date. It's a great phone, i'm loving it. MIUI 6 is awesome and it has great features. Heavy games & apps work very smooth. Battery life is excellent, charging only once a day in the morning.
0|4|very nice phone in the budget of rs 13000 compared to its peers.The camera and display is impressive.UI in camera is very user friendly and all adjustments are easy to handle.In heating problem i heard Xiaomi is going to release some software but still not received so far.This is an outstanding product and will remove the general impression of indians reg. China's use and throw sub standard products
0|5|Camera both front and rear are excellent and overall very good and handy phone. It has 4G SIM, but never used it. Battery Backup is also good.
0|2|This product is a good example of cheap Chinese product quality. Looks nice but basic hardware quality is poor. I am a light user with very few applications installed. Still I have to re-boot the phone thrice a day to stay connected. Following are some of the problems: 1) If you have large contact list, it will take forever to load your contacts, you may have to re-start after few hours of usage 2) If you are on roaming, then you will have to remove and re-add the apps to the whitelist, otherwise you will not able able to access the internet 3) If you are in an area where the network strength is poor, while other people may be making calls comfortably, this phone will not catch any network 4) The loud speaker is very poor I was hoping to use this phone for a year, but after 1 month of usage I am looking to replace this phone already.
0|5|I brought this phone is about 1 month back. i feel this is best phone for that price. Value for money. Thank you flipkart.
0|5|I love Mi products. this is one of the best example of quality product. completely lag free mobile handset.
1|5|Build quality very good. Features to price - loaded!! Good phone for anyone to buy with a tight budget. Camera quality is very good.
0|2|After using one month speaker out. Data connection dosent work properly for that you need to turn off the sim & switch on then only connects the data. Looks very slim & good appearance but performance is bad.
1|1|The phone gets heated up very quickly within 5 minutes of usage. I bought the phone two days back . The display and the features are good but has major heating issues
0|3|there are some UI issue like Mail app does not work properly, reminders for meeting are not audible, etc
1|1|Everything is good but it have major hitting issue. You can not keep near your year after 10 min talking as it become too hot. I have upgraded but still no luck.
1|4|Pros 1.Camera (performs so good in indoor too) 2. Dual Sim Cons: 1. Heating issue 2. No Expandable storage. If you are looking for a phone with good camera and dual sim in this price range, go for it.
0|5|beast mobile ever arrived for this amount... i recommend everyone for 13k..really worth it... even though it's too hot, it with stands charge . everything going very well... especially-display,build structure,camera,4g dual sim,themes....so on i don't know whether it breaks glass i didn't test it... so go for it
0|5|The Best Phone ever I have used. Everything is excellent in this phone. Before the update the phone got heat up but after update( MIUI 6.6.2.0), the phone actually works great. Last Amazing Phone.
1|4|The phone is good but MI customization needs to take care about: - google chrome new tab thing-new tab opened as new window - no. of notification pop up in an app- 300 messages in whatsapp, whatsapp still has red-shaded 1 on its app icon. - google voice search useless notification - music player need to be improcved - notification pop need to be handled well... MI is still serving us good phones, although these small bugs/shortcomings in the software need to be cleared...
0|3|camera quality is good. But there is battery heating problem and low sound. battery backup is o.k. touch is good.
0|1|I Purchased the Mi 4i on 25 the of June .The specification is good see but functioning is worst .Much heating problem , drain- Off of battery quickly even for short duration calls. Non response of touch screen promptly,Very low ringing sound even you may miss your calls.I can not recommend to even for enemy also .Never buy the phone and dont waste your money and time by just by tempting specification.
1|4|But less than 1gb user application space available. Recent updates are good...Earlier there was a data conectivity issue, but now its fixed
1|4|No doubt good phone value for money. shifting from samsung or xyz to 4i, Need to remember. 1) Bluetooth : no backward compatibility with 2.x with most car audios, someone using the handsfree will be crippled. Xi Mi has no support. 2) Phone Charging is slow, very slow to reach 100% 3) you will have challenges porting contacts, etc... from your old phone. but still doable. Feature 4) strangely allows dual clock, does not allow to set 2 separate time zones for each clock.
0|2|The phone was delivered on 25/May and was good. After the recent upgrade of the software, it started giving problems with charging. Every time, the phone had to be restarted before the charge or otherwise it doesn't charge. Yesterday, the battery was completely discharged and it stopped charging. It is disgusting. Otherwise it has been a fantastic piece that worked good for a little less than two months. I was looking for a possible fix on the internet and found that this is a common issue that most of 4i users are facing. I can't even return the phone now as return period is over. I have written to the vendor and awaiting a response. Hope to receive a positive response.
0|5|Nice Battery Backup Clean UI Heating Issue is not much Very Good Display Very Nice Camera Rear and Front Camera are excellent and One of the best in the class Touch IS Very Very Smooth
0|1|Got my 4i today morning and I am writing this update in less than 1 hour of receipt. The phone came with MIUI v 6.5.5 and at initial startup itself, phone showed signs of heating, unbearable by all standards of mobile phones. The phone then prompted me to update MIUI and I did ASAP ....got it to MIUI v 6.5.6.....restarted the phone....heating didn't subside...right now the phone is charging and both the back and screen is hot......just can;t place the phone near the ears. Rest everything about the phone is good as you may have read other reviews.....but heating is a major problem. Forget gaming, I haven;t installed any extra app so far except Whatsapp.........heating is indeed a major problem and that's why I give a rating of 1 star
1|4|its very good phone .. good camera quality overall is good :) ... but just 1 problem have no memory slot ..
0|5|It works great. not a big issue of heating. Camera is fab. if u're looking just go for it once again a awsm product by Xiaomi. Mi4i is best option under 15000 budget
0|5|The Phone is really a beautiful Monster in terms of looks and performance. Sound is good, Display is crisp, browsing is fast, Camera is good, though not played much with it. But initial impressions are good. Look and feel is really unbeatable.
0|4|Good phone at affortable Price .Blindly anyone can purchase which has high end config at low price.particularly the picture clarity is excellent and light slim model.easy to carry .
0|5|nice pone in this price even best service from customer service from customer care side i would like to prefer this phone to every one
0|1|after switching it on for the first time the update from mi failed due to corrupted software and flipkart asking me to visit the Mi service centre despite " 30 Days Replacement Guarantee" which seems to be a joke.
0|1|problems: 1. camera result not good.(below average) 2. Network signal problems 3. Internet connection not continue connected to ur phone. u will miss some notification updates.(i changed 3 sim card) 4. Worst flipkart return policy. After 2 request of return, still they people not accepted. Ask for go to service center.
0|5|Brought this mobile phone in a flash sale organize by Flipkart "lucky" got this one the product was deliver within 4 working days at my provided address Packing done by the company was good the product was packed with full responsibility and it seems that some thing very powerful is packed inside. At the first impression the mobile looks cool the design of the mobile seems that work by the company has done very precisely,the display work looks eye catching and the colors are very vivd too. which is good too it does't seems they are penetrating the eyes and you can not move eyes from its screen away,Now on battery it has a non removable battery which really gives a 3100mah backup,performance of mobile is also a markup i had installed some games which runs seamlessly on its platform it comes with updated Android 5.1. The box contains A mobile set,USB cable ,a plug port and user manual, there are no headphones so you guys have to pay another 500 bucks for that which seems to me the only darwback of this phone overall this makes a great impression on me . finally value for money thing should try once
0|5|hello every body, i purchased mi4i grey on 15th july 2015, n m completely in lv with dis device. touch sensors are grt. cnt review in a technical manner so writting in a layman language. camera is awsm, both frnt n back. features are grt. speed is very good n seriously m not facing ny heating issues. battery is good, earlier i was using samsung grand 1. nyone looking for a mid range for u cn go for it. i played modern combat 5, assasin creed pirates, n yes its working awsm. thnx flipkart, thnx mi4i
1|1|guys please dont buy this phone. in market there are many other mobiles u can buy those instead of this MI4I
0|1|It takes 4hours to charge it fully and it drains in 15 hours irrespective of the usage, even if i turn off wifi and data connection and dont use it, it drains out completely, such a worst experience, i buy this mobile hoping that it can be up for minimum 2 days, because i dont use the mobile much, i just use it for incoming calls and use it for texting, but this device drains very quickly in the night also, it doesn't go to standby mode. Other problem is the mobile network, it was working fine in both slots, after few days it stopped working in one sim slot, i know the mobile connection is exclusive, mean it works only in one slot at a time, but my problem is, one slot permanently stopped working, even if i just put one sim card, it wont work, so now i use the other slot which work. I should have bought Samsung, i liked this mobile configuration, so bought it, but now realize this mobile does not work as it suppose to. I recommend not to buy this mobile. Buy samsung or motorola.
0|5|after 4 days of use,first of all no heating problem,no lag even in balance mode,rear camera was not upto my expectation... sometime the screen freezer its happenes once in a bluemoon likes,brilliant display,touch is good... overall killer mi.............
0|1|Its the worst product that you could ever buy . The worst phone by xiaomi till date. Its getting heated up and after update the 2 processors are permanently disabled .! So lesson for xiaomi is that wait for the reviews and then buy the product i feel like i have been cheated ! i wish i cud give zero stars to this device .
0|5|I have been using it since 2 months. I really like the camera and display, also good battery backup. Smooth UI and pretty customizable
0|5|Stunning Camera (Both Front and Back) than others of same MP, Full HD display (441 ppi, very few phones have this ppi ), Good Customized User Interface and Performance to respond quickly. Dont Disappoint of having only 16 Gb internal storage, If you are not a high end HD game ADDICTED.
0|2|Gallery and Music Player is not showing files that are manually downloaded from other phones. some software like safe gallery, and app lock is also not supporting. I requested to replace my phone on 13 july 2015.
1|4|Product as described, Camera is really goo, in love wid slow motion and timelapse feature, only complaint is it gets very hot and sometimes it lags a lot. overall nice.
0|5|It has been a month since I am using Mi4i and it has really changed my perception on low cost phones escpecially Chinese makes. Camera is just great. Selfie lovers would like it a lot. Though it gave heating problem while playing game for more than an hour, but it reduced after adding some apps. Audio output with microhone is good, but without it its barely audible. Plays almost all file types. OTG support is also an advantage. Considering the price tag, i guess this is BEST, yes i repeat BEST phone in the market currently.... Will review it again a month after.....
0|4|All things are Good But Phone hang some time while open the files and playing the videos. Camera Quality Best.
0|4|Phone has one of the best HD dsplay in market in this price range.Camera (rear ) is good but selfie camera is outstanding with beautify option. features wise overall its nice phone.batttery performance is good mean you can use this phone all day but while using 3g data it drains fast.Some extra feature of age and gender determination while taking selfie are interesting but unnecessary coming to the drawbacks phone has issue of heating after update it still exists.its not able to handle high end games.music palyer could have made better.Recently I observed phone gets restarted suddenly. Waiting for next update that may resolve these issue.
0|3|Good Product Mi4i Good Features Good Camera, Good Display but Please Provide Headphone Mi4i Next Model mi4i please Add micro sd slot
0|1|touch screen got hanged, speakers & microphone went off and now the charger isnt working, for 2 different pieces.
1|1|I recently bought this phone. It doesn't worth for money. 1. Heat.. heat... heat... 2. Software issue 3. Slow performance 4. All themes showing with chinese language 5. There is no return and no refund the amount Don't buy this.. I think Xiaomi creates marketing strategy. i am fooled by their marketing strategy. Dont buy this.
0|4|Yes the phone heats up a bit, even after the update received. But its not that bad. I just loved the phone (specs, build, camera, etc) I would say Yes Go for It.
1|4|The mobile is good, it is lite weight and problem is "Getting heat while playing Games", I feel that locking system is not upto mark, whenever if you kept in pocket it will open immediately, if you not setting the screen lock then it will be problem.
0|1|I purchased this product a month back, the screen display, all 3 buttons are not working due to small scratch on the glass. I have visited MI service centre, without basic investigation they are asked me to replace entire display. Guess what price for that is 6500 Rs. I have called up MI customer care, they are saying sorry for the inconvenience but i have to get the replaced by paying the price. I wouldnt suggest this phone to any one.. plz dont buy and dont waste your money on this pathetic phone.
0|5|Product is Good - the best in the offered price bracket. Still it is just 1 month using it - finger crossed for the quality and services
0|3|battery is getting charged even if at that time some heat not a matter. But while using and if you keep in your pocket after use you feel the heat.
1|1|2GM Ram, specs on paper better than other phones but pathetic device. Massive lag. Even opening chrome takes a few seconds. Don't even try opening multiple apps. I am throwing this in the dustbin. Chinese stuff is eventually chinese, where Xiaomi or someone unknown brand.
0|3|I used this product from last 1 month 1. Biggest problem is its ringing sound is very low usually when phone is in pocket u doesn't hear the ringing sound and vibration too. 2. heating issue -- even after upgrading the software sometimes while talking it heats too much. 3.it doesn't connect with my Sony Ericsson Bluetooth headset. 4.it doesn't have external memory slot. Now good features of phone. 1.Camera quality is good. 2.good battery backup. 3.Screen resolution is nice. 4.Light weight and slick design. All in all a good phone in this budget. Thanks
0|1|Its been 20 days exactly since i bought this phone and suddenly the phone showed its true face.The battery is getting leaked and its getting so hot while charging and when speaking in a call.Suddenly it stopped from getting charged though the charger is working fine.I hate to talk about the camera which is another worst part with no clarity and i even stopped taking pics with the mobile. my suggestion is to be aware of this mobile since many people faced problem with the battery issue.
0|1|I purchased this mobile last month and within a month charging problem started i.e. if you don't restart mobile it will not detect charging. Also speaker stopped working now I am not able to hear any ringtones songs as well as alerts.!!
0|4|Very impressive phone for this price. it includes all specifications and supports all latest apps. Great display, even under sun light . Very thin and stylish to hold . Processor is fabulous . But the issue is the heating . This phone is heating more than usual. Battery is standing for two days by average usage.
1|1|Mobile was not up to my expectations. A faulty product was delivered first which used to restart once every 2 minutes. Had to go through a lot of process & time to get it replaced with a new mobile. Even the new one is not up to the mark. Overheat problem is still there. And performance wise I have seen better mobiles. There is a definite mismatch between RAM(Low) and Processor(High). Although the feel & finish of the mobile and camera are pretty good. Conclusion - Definitely not worth the price.
0|1|goood but not beat k3 is far far better .. K3 NOTE HAS EXPENDABLE CAPACITY . simcard drawer was a night mare..... worst pn i had ever seen
0|5|Guyz the performance of this phone is awsme, i like display and music quality much! well i will say please go for it 1
0|1|Just got my mi4i ... WORST PHONE EVER .... my 1000 bucks nokia was better ..overheats in a second and cameras all f'd up
1|1|interchanged with latest higher version - Phone get hang a few times - Service quality should be maintained
0|3|I purchases with good hope. But found Mi Ui very slow after using 2 months. Also it gets stuck and restart itself atleast once or twice a day on an avg. Not recommended to buy. Only thing is it has good configuration but whats the use if Mi Ui OS is not optimized to work on it.
0|5|Good in all aspects: M using this mobile since a week..got fully satisfied with this mobs. 1. No Heating Issue. 2. Camera & Sound is Perfect. 3. All aspect Best to Buy. ***Thanks Flipkart to provide this at the earliest with full safety***
0|3|Mi4i is indeed very good phone. It deserves 5 star, but due to heating issues giving 3 star. It's around 20 days i have being using Mi4i but still i am facing heating issues. Phone gets heated upto 41.5 to 42.5 degree during normal usage like talking for 5-10 mins, checking emails, reading ebooks, etc Have done factory reset, updated the phone to latest software version provided by Xiomi. But still facing the heating issue. Have requested to get the piece change as it seems to be device specific problem.
0|5|Its a great value for money product. Pros- Constant MIUI Updates Camera quality Display Cons- No expandable memory
1|2|It's been only 2 -3 days that I have used this phone. First impression is as follows: 1. Gets heated up real quick. I wish I had read earlier reviews. Because of this heating issue, I am skeptical of putting cover which would as an insulator and might not allow heat to dissipate. 2. Good interface. 3. Battery is decent. Doesn't feel like 3100 mAh. 4. Looks and touch wise it is good. 5. Less than 1 Gb of 2GB of RAM available
0|3|Below are few things which i felt after 10 days of usage. 1. Build quality is look. MIUI is cool. Gives clean GUI. 2. Screen resolution is great with effective capacitative touch. 3. Battery is average. It takes around 3 hrs for battery to reach 100% and will stand for a day even with minimal usage. This is where it gets annoying. 4. Have few software glitches. 5. With Airtel 3G data connectivity is horrible on this device. Over all MI4i is a average product.
0|4|I've been using this from a month now and the phone is good. The first phone had issues with camera for which Flipkart made me go to the service centre to get a certificate of change which they gave in about 10 seconds. I'm not satisfied with the new service of flipkart. I had to travel 15kms from my home. Will flipkart return my money and time wasted in going to the service centre? The camera had a clear problem which they did not want to agree.
0|4|I bought this phone for my dad and he is happy with the phone. One con I think is 16GB memory. It would be better if there is an SD card slot or more 16GB internal memory for the same price like lenovo K3 note however it is 9999/- only or MI4 64GB version. All other specifications are pros for me like cam,display quality, gaming experince. Sound is OK good.
0|2|1. The Device gets heated up very quickly. 2. Software has many problems. 3. Automatically calls. 4. Battery backup not good for working people.It does nt last for 6 hours. 5. The device is only a Show Off kind. [from outside] 6. MIUI is nearly worst.Nothing to do with android. All info's are after 2 months experience I suggest Never buy this device
0|5|I've been using this device for last 3 weeks. Awesome experience so far. Pros :- Flawless display Wonderful battery management Lightweight Camera Best UI Cons:- It lags sometimes & Lil bit heating Verdict:- Overall It's good phone. Still leader in this price range
1|2|This mobile is very good I want to buy also. But in this mobile there is biggest disadvantages is Expendable memory slot is not given.
0|5|hi all this is a awesome mobile all the features r very good value for money very handy compared to all big mobiles in market. only draw back is 16 gb memory cant extend but OTG option which balance this so please go for it.
1|5|Good camera quality....... Good looking phone... Nice full HD screen.... Its a value for money phone.
0|5|the handset is awesome, full HD, video/picture capture is gd, fast response. very handy, slim too, music quality is gd. thanks for flipkart for fastest delivery in next day.
0|2|Phone got nice specs. Good look and finish. Feels very light in hand. After a month's use, started with restart, heating issues. Please check your piece that you got.

0|5|The product which i received is working so good.The camera quality is so good special the front camera. Its give us to amazing selfie. the touch is so fast I am satisfied with this mobile.
1|2|Everything seems to be perfect in normal day to day usage except Storage. The available 10 GB seems to be Too Small in now days usage. A 32 or 64 GB version in Much needed !
1|5|superb smart phone at very affordable price tag of 12999 and now with exchange offer too. so hurry up guys grab it
0|4|MI4I IS NUMBER 1 PRODUCT.... The phone was awesome slime phone 13mp camara 5 mp rear camara... nice product by mi thanks
0|2|The Sar value is in excess of 1.2 W/Kg which is way too high. The MI team might argue that its within the limit but a good phone is which is less then 0.5W/Kg of SAR. These radiations really harm your brain and body. The lesser they are, its good..
0|5|A great buy at this price tag.One of the best display phones available under 15k. Camera is great and images look even better on a full hd display. Everything looks better on 1080p display. Processor is also good but sometime lags.Battery is also good ,can run upto 3 days without charging under half brightness and wi-fi and bluetooth turned off.But storage is a problem;unexpandable storage.But otg helps.Though it is a personal choice but i like MIUI.But it is not receiving any software update(may be not upgradable upto 5.1 or higher) What more can you expect at this price point?
0|5|1. Speed is very good 2. Display is Excellent 3. Voice Call Quality is Very GOOD 4. Camera Quality is SUPER Issue : Most of the time 3G Network not able to connect( Bangalore - eCity). Other than Network issue problem. Rest everything is very good.
1|4|I am using this mobile for the past 2 months. Light weight & good performance. Satisfied my expectation. I feel this product is worth/better to buy for the price of Rs. 13,000 range when compared other products. Camera, Phone heat issue & speaker were are on low performance side, otherwise overall assessment is it's good phone to buy.
0|5|no words...totally outstanding...just perfect perfect and perfect... phone contains all and everything whichever we wants...
1|5|The product is excellent in all respects. It took little bit of time to get used to MIUI 6 after uprgrading from version 5. The sound, call quality, display all are above average. Although battery though large does not really seem to hold that capacity as it exhausts similar to 2200-2300 capacity battery.
0|4|The phone is working fine,nice battery backup.. thumbs up for this....................................
0|3|Its a good phone but certainly with issues... Camera is superb, Battery ok. light weight, Very delicate, Heating problem persists even after updates, gets hanged up in between and I am facing WiFi hotspot connnectivity problem especially with my laptop.
1|5|the product has good at there all side but onething disappointed me that heating after little span of time.xiaomi shall do something about this
0|3|compared to my previous i phone i only miss the audio clarity from headphone it never heated like i phone, light weight and one hand use, battery is excellent further more display is outstanding, quick charging more useful, more than i sure that you will not be disappear about the camera both f&b. lollipop is also gave me better experience
0|3|no need to say its pros as you would have already seen it in the specifications... lets head directly into cons 1st.... games like injustice, mortal combat x and other huge games lags.....infact lags horribly 2nd.... heats up like pressure cooker when using the phone while charging.... not to mention heats up otherwise also 3rd....from personal experience had the pphone replaced in a week because the display went green and stopped working.... conclusion hardware design is too delicate... well not to mention but the pros are 1st.... camera is too daamn good.. Compared camera of xperia z2, iphone 6 plus and mi4i.... Was shocked to see it to be better than the other two... A PERFECT PHONE FOR SELFIES 2nd...price is too damn reasonble... if you are a student and badly need a good phone go for it(well not recommended for heavy gamers)
1|4|display is good, perfomance is good, battery is good i recharge it once in two days. if you are not brand crazy then this phone will is value for money buy.
1|5|this is a great phone for 12999. Loved it. I would recommend this phone for others as well. There is little heating problem, but it gets somewhat lesser after doing a OS software update
1|1|Phone looks are excellent but Quality is not that great .I purchased this around 2 months back and start facing issues . 1) Suddenly connectivity lost and phone got restart . 2) Heating Problem while using net or playing games. 3) Incoming Call gets rejected itself. 4) Camera Quality is not good as per 13 megapixel , Samsung 8 megapixel is better than this. Overall not satisfied.
0|5|best in this range only problem is its storage capacity, limited 16 gb is not enough todays concern, otherwise best within 20k range
0|3|Not up to the expectation battery drains so fast, not even last for 12 hours that means 3120mah is not genuine. rear camera is just okay, no wow result so far in day or night. better put some more bucks and go for big brand like htc, now I realize why big brands are expensive. size is okay, display is good that's it. Making you register and keeping limited stock, increase the value of phone but it is just a way of flipkart's marketing trick. It is just an average phone do not expect too much
0|4|over all phone is good and performance also good, but Battery performance could be batter and heating problem also.
0|4|I am using this mobile,just superb...i like it very much..worth for money...very much comfortable..easy to handle.
0|1|Stuck on boot screen since a long long time after latest update 6.6.2.0 . It has really sucked my life up...........Buy a Mi 4i but never update it....
0|4|This phone have awesome specs only prob is its battery drainage but can be a solved issue if some setting made.
0|2|Frequently get hanged and felt heavy heat. while making call, ring is going and the call is also attended by the received, but you can't hear their voice. if the reboot the mobile, the problems get solved. so we have to reboot or switch off and on the mobile often.
0|1|The phone is looking so good, Light in weight, Display is very good but performace of the phone is very bad hanging, heating, earpiece sound quality is too bad, Chargning issue (sometimes after restart charge again and it is repeated process).
0|5|Worth Rs13000 . Too good display, and processor is too good as well. Very light weight. Slim and look n feel is very good. Very smooth transitioning time. Camera is good as well. Juts the lens of the camera is not too good. But yes with this mush of money the camera is very good both front and rear.
0|5|Fantastic phone ..... it feels awesome to use this lovely phone ... far far better than Micromax and other brands
0|5|I'm Fully Satisfied with Mi 4i Really Very Good Phone....!! Very Nice Camera & Display...!! Just Waiting for Mi 5 plus
0|5|If You can manage your stuffs in 11 GB with 2GB RAM speed with awesome User Interface, DON'T THINK.. GO FOR IT..
0|5|hi guys, phone is very good performance, camera rear and front both are very sharp and good pixel quality. good ppi and awesome os by miui anroid. total value for money.
0|5|hi guys, phone is very good performance, camera rear and front both are very sharp and good pixel quality. good ppi and awesome os by miui anroid. total value for money.
1|4|Except some minor problems every thing is good. Phone Sometimes hanging while you open facebook app & camera.
0|4|RAM comes with a little bit problem but overall the mobile phone is best in range Update of 800 MB is also harrowing
0|3|Except heating rest all is fine in the phone. After firmware update too there is no change. After unplug from charging not able to handle calls for sometime due to heat near speaker.
0|4|I have been using this phone from past 10 days and it is a decent phone for the price tag and worth buying it. There are many pros and many reviews have covered it. There is no problem with heating as i have used it moderately and there is no problem. So far not encountered any software bugs with 10 days of usage with latest software update. I will just mention the CONS I am using the flip cover and with it there is no problem but with out the flip cover it is slippery. The Audio sound level(Ring tone + Music playback) could have been better. Image Quality is decent and not very great, may be at this price this is what you get for the amount you have paid.
0|5|I had purchased this phone for gifting someone. The user is extremely happy with the quality of the product. I would say, if you're looking for a phone below 15K, there should be no where else to look. I have always been a MI fan for its UI. Especially, for mid-aged people, this is a very user friendly phone. Never tried gaming or applications that require high end performance, so wouldn't be correct to comment on that aspect. However, for basic usage, music, camera, movies, basic day to day application, light games, mails, ets, this should be the perfect option. The screen resolution is one of the best in this price range. I love how the bezels are minimal and thus giving a good viewing experience. I would strongly recommend this product for people with average day to day usage and not willing to spend a fortune on a smart phone offering all latest features.
0|4|A lot has been written about this mobile. Here are my observations for this after using it for 45 days,in short... Very beautiful,sleek,slim and lightweight. Display is awesome.Nobody dares to disagree with this ! Sound volume-certainly less.I missed a few calls while the set was in my pants pocket. Battery life-OK,nothing great about it. Technically,I don't know a thing.Octacore processor or MUIU (or whatever) are like words in ancient Greek for me. Overall,a great phone for me,someone who doesn't play games and not much inclination towards photography but someone who surfs the net more than 12 hours a day.
0|4|good product , better to put external storage capacity in the future product.in all aspect's this phone is good to purchase. but price little bit high.
0|5|Good product. Quick delivery.The phone looks great, and works seamlessly. Quick delivery by Flipkart.
1|1|Do not buy any MI phones... while phones are good till they work, but if you have to replace any part of the phone, you will have tough time.... MI Service Centre at Navi Mumbai has quoted Rs.9000 to replace the display of Mi4i, cost of which as you know is 13000, so almost 70% just for replacement of the display...
0|1|the battery back up is very poor, when make a video call front camera does not function properly and the replacement quarenty is very poor, take care
0|3|I got this device one month ago.Rear camera13MP is good but could have been better.I compared it with lumia 6.1MP camera.Pics were better on lumia.Front cam is good.There is heating issue.Device heats quickly on continuously talking/gaming for 10min or so.Speaker /ringer is bad.you cant hear its ringtone if you r in other room.n so the music player.Big Problem no 1-No expandable sorage.Although its 16GB,but available mem is only around 10GB.2-Non removable battery.u cant even open this device.Batt is of 3100MAH but it drains in a day.3-No easy access service centres.But performance is excellent.No laggings.Superb touch screen.Fantastic sensors. But price is high.lenovo K3 note has almost same specs but only of 9999.
0|5|this is best phone in this range. spacially for display of this mi 4i is very bright in under sun light not hang, not heat after update his software,gaming is very smooth so pick up...........
1|2|was delivered in 2 days of registration thanks to flipkart amazing delivery system, but to my disappointment I received a faulty piece.the front camera was not working .
0|4|Its been a few weeks since I am using this phone. My first piece received had a camera and battery defect. But, thanks to the efficient Flipkart 30 day return policy, I received a new well working piece. It has an excellent front and rear camera for its price, and a the best of its class screen. I think it is good for people with normal and heavy usage, it provides a quick response and long battery. If you are into daily heavy usage, you may face a slight lag and heating issues. I would rather suggest the Asus Zenfone 2 in that case. Overall an excellent buy, though i wish it could have had a memory card expansion slot. Other than that, it is a great buy for me. Highly recommended.
0|4|AFTER OPENING THE PHONE YOU WILL AMAZED TO SEE SUCH A GREAT DISPLAY. THE QUALITY OF MAIN CAMERA IS MORE THAN AMAZING AND FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD.AFTER THE DISPLAY AND CAMERA, LOOK OF THE PHONE COMES AND ITS AGAIN GREAT. I CONSIDER OPTICS (CAMERA,DISPLAY,LOOK) MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE SOUND-YES ITS LOUD AND GOOOD. AFTER USING THE PHONE I FORGOT THE TERM 'HANGING'.YES, I DOEN'T HANG MY FRIENDS. "its better to buy a PHONE OF XIAOMI THAN A STONE OF SAMSUNG SONY" as my true rating is 4.3 star but there was no option for it. is there heating?......yes friends the phone heats up .after changing the phone 15 times and draining the battery the heating will reduce 50%.then update it,there will be no heating at all. internal memory is 16gb and it you cant expand it,it may bother some people but it was okay for me. its MIUI6 is good.. and daily you will discover a new feature of this phone. GAMING-good,very gud,very very gud.... costumer support-yes they give it all 7 days...and the call is free..you will have a great feeling after hearing-"saomi india me apka swagat hai,aaj ke liye mai apka technical expert hu.". NETWORK-again gud...better signal than phones of Nokia... ONLY 1 REASON NOT TO BUY IT-if u have rs 23000 and you can wait for a new launch then wait for MI5, only if your budget is rs23000. #FINAL VERDICT-if you also consider optics(dislay,camera) more than anything else and 16 gb memory doesn't bothers you and you want a phone that has great look then MI4i is made for you.
1|5|After reading a lot of reviews I decided to go-ahead with Mi4i. The phone is absolutely worth the money. Its been 3 weeks i'm using the phone and it has never caused any issues. The applications dont hang nor the phone heats up like the other xiaomi models. Its light weight though sturdy. The camera on the phone is a little above the average while other features in the phone gives you a rich feel.
0|5|Awesome camera.......no comparison with others phones.......................... Resolution of screen is also very nice ...... nice choice to buy........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|3|Product not having External memory support/Slot. little sad, But mobile is good. further may come with more features.
0|4|Battery life is fantastic, one charge keep going for atleast 10 hours, video call function from device not available. One - hand mode is not working. sound quality is excellent. screen display and cameras are worth every penny. overall the product is value for money.
1|4|Everything is Good, but ringtone voice is very low, hard to listen from your pocket. Product according to price ...
0|5|after 2 months of uses i can say its an excellent phone display is so sharp and good sumtimes it beat the reality also battery backup is also fine last longer one day with wi fi connectivty camera captures pics so fast and also of hd quality. phone is slim and lightweight . finally its a good fn in this price range one thing thats not good is no externat sd card slot / but it support otg
0|5|Excellent Phone. The only issues are that it gets quite hot while using. Secondly its memory is only 16 GB which is not expandable.
0|4|Phone is awesome. Only drawback is the speaker volume. Speaker volume is very low. When the phone rings, sometimes it goes un-noticed because of the low volume.
0|3|quick heating / initially speaker not working properly same got rectified thro service center. now a days 16 GB storage is in sufficient.
0|4|Using this product,and satisfied with mostly ,all the aspects.MI suite is exceptionally good,however sorting files in USB drive via OTG has been badger.& sound is very poor.Camera is good ,though red eye removal/reduction seems inconspicuous.
0|4|I am using this phone extensively for the past 2.5 weeks. Pros: Great form factor, usable in single hand, very sensitive touch screen, display has a very good resolution and color reproduction. Both front and back Cameras take great pics, the camera options are plenty and useful, and they have put a manual mode too ! The battery is huge and easily lasts a day's usage. Cons: MI User Interface is average, available memory for the user is just 10.5 GB. There is some mild heating at the top of the phone when playing even average graphics intensive games. This is in spite of having all the latest software updates from Xiaomi. the heating goes away pretty fast once the game is stopped. overall a good phone..
0|1|its very slow, poor performance, heatup. its not support 3d games. camera quality is poor. overall dont go to buy it.
0|5|loved it........... perfect smart phone ever...... best camera,best processor,best display whole total i would say,,just close ur eyes n take it...
0|5|Awesome phone; using it since a month and I'm yet to find a flaw! Camera quality is super. Batter backup is unmatchable. With WiFi, Bluetooth (using Mi Band) full day on batter almost survives 2 days. Hope the performance continues. 1 in Mi Fan Club :)
0|4|product is good and as usual awesome delivery by flipkart cheers. Using since last week and till now no issues. battery life is good
0|3|This phone boasts of the best specifications and after the update it does not heat much. The plus side is:- 1. Cheap 2. 4G 3. Battery is OK Negative Points 1. It looks like a cheap phone 2. I don't get proper connectivity on data with this phone 3. The 16 GB memory is not expandable 4. The MIUI OS is painful I would rather go back to a Samsung or Similar product
0|4|for build i will give 4 star performance i will 3 star (-2 since it get heated during normal operation also, I am not sure how it is useful for high utilization) look 4 star (-1 for that flashy short Mi logo)
0|4|A great phone with a good battery life,excellent camera and brilliant display but has some hanging issues
0|5|Woth to buy it and give feeling of any other branded phone, still using note 3 but satisfied with Mi 4i
1|4|value for money. good product with fast delivery service. only thing external memory should be allotted. Rest at all things are good.
0|4|I could find the mobile is worth for its features. I have one issues which is secondary camera initially it was good. In recent days it picks up grains when capturing image. Couldn't resolve it.
0|3|First think I must mention that they didn't took so long to deliver the product. Before you buy, please note following points 1.Inspite of giving good configuration at cheaper rates, they didn't add earphone, screen protector in the box. (screen protector is not easily gettable in market, those which are available on Flipkart, don't seem a convincing product ) 2. No memory card slot, user get more than 10GB. 3. Always consumes more than a GB of RAM, even if no application is running. 4. Heats up like cooling pan. An update fixes that problem, they claim. But I am still disappointed with it. 5. Camera is good, but manual setting mode is foolish.
0|5|Well am writing this review only to tell u guys dat i have been through a lot of yes/no while buying this phone. Every one knows the perception of chinese products in India. Well the Mi series has certainly turned dat thing upside down. MI4i turns out 2 be am amazing product. As always comes with the amazing packaging form flipkart. Superb front and back camera like the best in there class. The Snapdragon processor works like an engine with brute force and allows superb multitasking and gaming experience. The display undoubtedly turns out the best feature in this phone with a 1920 x 1080, 441 ppi screen. As the MIUI is new in the market its also working priety well. Just as every thing has its own perks dis phone has got some heating issues. Well dats gona happen wen u pack so much in so little space. You need not to worry of u r not a heavy gaming freak. 3120mAh battery packs enough juice for about 35-40hrs. The overall looks are also astounding as i can now flaunt this fone in front of my friends carrying motoG 2nd Gen, asus Zenfone 5 & Lenovo A6000. Winding up overall dis phone is worth its price n if ur planning 2 buy pls go for it without any 2nd thoughts. Kudos..!! Proud Mi user...
0|4|a quality product and i don't face any heating problem at all....looks awesome but sound quality could be better..... even my old nokia phone has much better sound quality... but overall satisfied with it... cause bought for display which is just mind blowing....
0|5|has some heating issues, but its a great product for that price. cant complain every product has its own pros and cons.Performance wise, looks wise its a nicely packaged product for that price range. i'd definitely recommend to others.
0|5|I have been using this for three weeks. I don't see any problem. Its value for money Display is awesome
1|4|Mobile is as per expectation but only issue is that it gets heated up and battery does not last for long
1|4|After using it more than a month, i can say, its a cool product. everything is nice except - sound, sometimes it hangs whenever i open facebook. this make me sad that i cant store much without expandable memory.
0|1|Never indicates Missed call, can not make a call in one touch, heating problem, Regret purchasing it...
1|4|Phone is good but its front camera in low light is very dull. All other features are great in this value package
1|4|Good and descent phone. Of-course very good features to the value. But the flaws I noticed are, 1 Over heating: Well you have already read about this in most of the comments. It's true. It DOES heat in descent usage. FYI I don't play any type of games on my mi4i. Still facing the issue. The Xiaomi gave an OTA update(MIUI V6.5.4.0 LXIMICD) for the heating issue but the heating have reduced by near 70%. That means the issue still remains 30% 2. Hyper sensitive Touch: It's the problem of the most OGS display in market. But surprisingly in the case of Mi4i, it's insane. Many time I find my phone get auto dialed, turned on apps/camera inside my pocket. They have provided a solution in "Settings", called "Prevent pocket dial", but this is a much much more head-ache for the user. Except these others are fine. So, 4 star. As usual Flipkart delivered it in just 2 days..........Superfast.

1|1|hey friends.. i have purchased mi4i one month befor, now its front camera is not working.. so be carefull if you wish to purchase mi4i
0|1|Xiaomi - is living upto its vision by providing high end hardware at lower price than the competitors. But, they need to tweak their Quality check process, to filter the initial teething issues and retain the customers. I am not going to talk in detail about the hardware specifications here. But lets talk on the key + & - Key selling points for the phone 1. Good hardware spec - Though the processor is know for its slight heating issue 2. Great build quality 3. Right pricing Areas of improvement 1. Reliability issue in general with Xiaomi - out of the 4 Mi4s and 3 Mi4is I procured for my family and friends, 1 Mi4 went dead, 1 had to be replaced due to hanging issue, 1 Mi4i had to be replaced due to dead condition and 1 Mi4i was replaced due to heavy battery drain. Once replaced the phones are working fine, which means they are not properly tested out of the factory. 2. Excessive heating issue in Mi4i - Though it is due to the Snapdragon process, its the responsibility of Xiaomi to address it before releasing in mass market. Software updates have reduced the heat greatly and obviously there will be some performance drop, which will not be felt by average users. 3. Low volume - this will really be a deal breaker for few, based on their ambience noice. For a normal home or office environment, should be manageable Alternate options - The only alternate I can recommend is Mi4 (considering the price cut). I love both Mi4 and Mi4i for their fluidity and performance. Go-ahead and buy, provided you have the patience to take the replacement path, if the phone that reaches U is faulty
0|5|really good one, display and camera are really awesome....worth the price...no heating issue.13k is the reasonable price.
0|5|excellent phone...the only pain is that it does not display Gujarati fonts. Read few blogs n articles to solve the problem but it took lot of effort and technical ups n down to have it install on my phone. Please give some easy update to solve the problem. Otherwise the phone is awesome and 100% value for money.
0|4|It is a very good product and camera quality is superb... A sugg from my side to include more accessories along with the handset as in ear phone and a screen guard/back cover. Value for money and user friendly.
0|4|Display, call and rest all features are very very brilliant. Only cons - Non Expandable memory... but for me its OK.. I can manage within 16 GB.
0|2|Handset gets heated up while kept for charging and after charging mobile battery drain quickly. even battery life doesn't last for 4-5hrs.
1|1|1. Flipkart Worst ever 30 days return policy 2. the phone may have High SAR value than mentioned in the box - It will cook your brain like boiled egg, and many health issues are associated with it. If you bought already don't give this phone to your children below 10 years. No ethical and money minded Online shopping sites like Flipkart will sell anything to people. A setback to online shopping. Don't buy cheaper. Cheaper is not always better. You have to compromise quality and at the cost of your health.
0|1|I Just recevied the phn now..it was continously turnoff the display..the display has fully distrabances with stripes..i try to operate morethan 1minute the display was sudenly turnoff but phn was in running condition..Im fully upset with this phn..then think before purchase..
0|5|After making the order, I got the phone under 24 hours. Thanks to flipkart speedy delivery. The packing was good and up to the mark. After unboxing, i got a gem in my hand that what my friend called it. The best thing about the phone is the screen quality. It has a excellent display; great performance and superb multitasking. Camera is good too both front and rear. The phone looks classy and premium. The only thing i found little down was its speaker volume. It's not that loud. And one more thing due to smooth back finish, it tries to sneak out of my hand. Overall great phone. Thanx Xiaomi.
0|3|Front cam - super Rear cam - very poor battery backup - very poor processor - medium UI part - super
0|4|good quality phone with this price. smart and fantastic. but battery shows some issue , very heat after taking videos. afterall very nice product.
0|5|Good Phone though I have not used it as it was a gift to my uncle. But he says its the best phone he have ever used.
0|5|Fast delivery Amazing product. Faced small heating issues but gone with Software updates. Overall awesome.

1|1|i bought mi4i on 4ih june .this shit gets hanged on every app. it hangs 2 to 3 times a day . today it hanged and switched off automatically and did not on for an hour . this is a bullshit. please don't purchase this product.
0|3|Facing lot of issues in the applications. Swiftkey and other applications stops working suddenly. While dialing any number, phone stops working for sometime and I need to attempt to redial. Called up customer care twice and wiped Cache and applications but still mobile not working. Charger cable also giving issue. Very confused should I return it back. But holding as of now as I don't have backup phone as of now.
0|4|The phone is exceptionally well built with a superb screen And this is one hell of a gorgeous phone.This phone is indeed a beauty with the beast (snapdragon 615 2nd gen), but the beast becomes too hot after heavy uses. Buyers beware there are temperature issues in this phone. But if you are more of a casual user then this phone is the best. In normal uses temp. reaches up to 45 to 47 degrees. I haven't used it in 4G. But i guess it will be a lot lot hotter. But other than that every things seems all right. (wrote this after 25 days of use)
0|5|got 2 gb ram octa core processor good camera 13 mp rear & 5 mp front camera...too good main advantage is its pricing & 3000 mah battery with hd display with 440 ppi.. worth it... best to buy under this 15k category
0|1|My set is not working properly. while internet surfing or calling it is heating too much and then got switch off. After sometimes i have to make switch on.
0|5|Ultra light, fast, touch is very smooth, very handy, Camera quality is very awesome from both rear and front overall worth to money.
0|5|Recieved it on 1st and writing after a week's usage.. 1. First of all I'd like to tell the new buyers that the alleged heating problem was solved after miui 6.5.5 rom update..and it comes out of box with it..and now update 6.5.6 is also available ota..so no heating problems as such till now. Update:Now 6.6.1 is rolling out...check out the new features and performance is improved 2. Camera is just awesome!! Happy with both front and rear camera's performance. 3. Screen, build quality, call quality,performance... all are just perfect..no problems. 4. Still there are many cons - -You cannot set the notification tones for whatsapp as it only shows the longer ringtones not the smaller one -No album or artists view in music app...maybe some kind of bug. -No earphones in the package. U have to buy on ur own. Still it is a good product in this range so go for it!!
0|3|IT HAVE BAD BATTERY PERFORMANCE........ ONLY 2GB RAM & OCTA CORE PROCESSOR...OTHERWISE REDMI 1S IS VERY GOOD COMPARED WITH IT
0|4|ossm phone with gr8 features..great camera gr8 touch n processor cons- battery backup and speakers are not up to the mark
0|5|Is great...Experience is truly remarkable..... the product is nice and the delivery was really fast..!
1|1|I purchased a new Mi 4i yesterday from Flipkart. However the phone is getting heated for normal usage like calls and whatsapp. Phone quality is very bad. My money is lost for a low quality phone. Please don't buy Mi 4i - it has heat problem for normal usage.
0|1|i purchased this 2 months back since then its been a headache nothing else only thing which is impressive is its user interface problems 1. ringtone volume lowers, automatically (advance technology :P ) 2. it wipes up almost half internal storage and we are left with very little 3. now in recent technology advancement of this phone is that this phone does not charge at all buy lumia phone instead, they are 1000s times better than this trash, i am gonna drill it i am gonna break this with hammer i hate this phone they are copying iphone, yes it is a copy and a very bad copy i think they are just selling those rejected pieces in india which were not returned elsewhere
1|1|5 Star for Flipkart for Response but 1 star for product...0 is not available hence...fuddu mobile...no sound...not hear able from 4-5 distance when it rings...Heating lots..3 time replaced but issue same..do not purchase this bullshit.
0|4|Phone is Good,Wifi direct does not work Normal temp is around 34 Phone plugged to Laptop installs appln in chinese No Ear phones as accer overall good buy worth for money
1|1|Pros: Good Display even in Sunlight Good Sound quality Cons: MIUI is very heavy and 2 gb RAM is always used up. Applications like Chrome hangs very much. Google Cloud printing is intentionally blocked by mi due to there policy clashes with Google. Heats up very early. Simpler Games like Candy crush struggle to run smoothly. No Accessory or headphones are provided with this phone.
0|3|The phone is quite slow even for browsing and while opening apps The battery is good but the phone gets heated quite easily, it lasted for 2 days with minimal use. Camera quality is quite good both the rear and front camera, mainly i find the front camera very good. the speed at which the camera captures the snap is amazing which i dont find even in high end phones.
1|4|With the specifications & price it is offered in the market, it's worth spending for Mi4i. I have been using it since a month and till date I have no issues with it.
0|4|Very sleek phone, awesome specifications in this price range. It has a lovely camera (primary and front, both). The battery life is also awesome. 100% charged in the morning works easily till the end of the day with charge to spare. Definitely recommend this to people looking for phones in this price range. People looking for phones in a higher range should also give this phone a fair chance, it will not disappoint.
0|5|IN MY VIEW ACCORDING TO MI 4I PRICE TAG AND FEATURES ARE GOOD WITH 12999 SUCH AN AWESUM PHONE FOR SMART PHONE USERS BATERY LIFE IS 2 DAYS BUD CONS ARE : IT HEATS UP FOR GAMING ITS NOT GOOD PHONE AND IT WAS NOT EXPANDABLE ITS16GB ONLY
0|5|Mob is good.because it has 2gb ram and many more.it's compared to samsung note 3... 13 megapicxel. And front 5 megapicxel... And 16 gb internal memory... But it doesn't have card slot.... But it's good
0|5|another great product from Xiaomi. PROS: 1-Amazing Display. 2-Using this product from last two months no lag experienced till now. 3- Battery last all day long with normal usage. 4- MIUI is great. 5- Solid build quality. 6- Very light in weight and many more now Cons: 1- Gets heat up during playing games 2- Sound is low apart from these two i haven't find anything bad about this phone. Final verdict A gret phone at great price.
0|3|Nice phone at this price point except for the heating issues. The phone do get heated up considerable high when using the net. No updates solved this issue. Other than that the phone is a gem in all other aspects be it the display, the performance, the battery life etc etc. Going with 3 out of 5 just because of the heating.
1|1|Buggy Software, Hardware that has intermittent problems. I would never recommend this phone unless the person buying is into Research and Development. I have to ever depend on he MIUI forum to troubleshoot some of the issues. Others issues I am just hopping will be rectified in future updates.
0|2|I got this gadget 3 days back on july 3rd, Friday. I felt very happy after seeing the product and camera clarity. Even the Battery backup is good but when I have installed Temple Run 2 and played for 15 min......Then it started emitting heat heavily. I haven't experienced this even when I played this game in my old phone Xolo A 500. No Other problems except this heating issue. Those who are not interested in playing games can buy this phone without any doubt.
0|5|Even after 1 month of heavy usage there are no bugs with this phone ...... the only drawback is the storage ...even in the 12 GB of free space the regular updates takes off around 1.5 GB ,which makes the storage condition worse.. and we have only around 10 GB which may not be sufficient for some users.. Other than storage CAMERA,PROCESSING and all the other features are great ... and the battery lasts easily for 1 day even if u do multi tasking like gaming ,wifi....and on standby it lasts upto 3.5-4 days ... SO go get this phone if u think that storage is not a big issue for u..
0|4|Light weight, good looking, sound quality & FM Radio poor. Phone is getting lightly getting heated up
1|4|Apart from the few limitations like non expandable memory, Less RAM for the user due to MIUI and noise in low light pictures still that phone is not at all bad in this price range, Display is awesome
0|1|this product was missing in the box i get empty box and when i was complain against it i become un consious
0|3|1. Front Camera is better than Primary Camera. 2. Battery backup is very poor. It takes 4-5 hours for full battery charge but hardly it lasts for 16-18 hours with minimal usage. 3. Look and feel is good. 4. Slim and Handy. 5. Hangs with heavy game (like subway surfer).
1|5|Pros: Display, Camera, Processor, Battery, Customization Cons: Fixed Memory and Little bit of heating on continuous usage for more than an hour.
0|5|GOOD SMARTPHONE AND NICE CAMERA WITH PERFECT QUALITY IN HDR ALSO.. DUAL LED FLASH FIRST FLASH IS SAMSUNG CAMERA AND SECOND FLASH IS OF SONY CAMERA NICE QUALITY PICTURES
1|1|I'm using this product for past 10 days. There are several cons. So it's better I start with cons. CONS --------- 1) Heat - After I received this product I put it on charging. Phone started to heat up like a frying pan. Thankfully I was notified of an update. After installing that update heat issue started to become less prominent. I thought now I can use this product. I was soon proven wrong. This phone heats up while browsing. Try answering a call longer than 5 min. You'll feel the heat. I have to hold it 5 to 10 m away from my ear to continue a call. Don't know what to do with this phone. Should I carry an Ice Pack to use this phone? Memory - free memory after boot is around 800 MB. Not sure why MIUI needs so much of ram. Storage - Do not understand why they can't offer SD Card slot. 12GB internal storage is too low. Inability to disable crapware - you can't disable apps you don't like. So live with them. Convoluted software - a lot of menu options are hidden. E.g., storage is under Additional settings menu option. PROS: Battery backup - Getting a decent day long backup. Display - good vibrant display. Connectivity - both sim support 4G. In summary this phone is only for show. Excessive heat makes this product unusable.
1|4|This phone is a catch for the price it commands; i bought it in the first flash sale. Delivered in 3 days by flipkart. Pros: Good processor and looks, No lags in multi-tasking, Firm grip, decent battery life Good camera (but with a whitening finish for photos), Cons: Long charging time, Heats up Issues with net usage in 3G with both sims. Lack of earphones in the packing. Lack of memory card slot. Overall, a decent buy in the price range.
0|3|Purchased this phone after lot of research. My 1st choice was lumia 730 but due to issues in Whatsapp and limited apps I dropped it. 2nd choice was grand max but due to missing of gorilla glass that also dropped. Finally I selected this. Also same time MI4 price came down to 13999 level so I thought of buying same but dropped for single sim. Below are my findings: Pros: 1. Good speed 2. No heating issue. 3. Good screen display Cons: 1. Camera in day lighting is good with enriched colors. But I found my Moto G2 better in clarity. 2. Night or low light camera is very poor with so much of noise(grainy). Also we will not be able to take any useful picture in low light if object is coverage area is more than 1 meter or distance from object is more than 1 meter. Not at all expected from this phone. I had Lenovo A6000 its camera in day & night was better than Moto G2.Now comparing with Mi4i where it should stand. Mi4i is very poor low light performer. Camera rating Lenovo A6000 - 9 Moto g2 - 8 Mi4i - 6 3. Low speaker output. I am again thinking on my buy. Whether I should have purchased Lumia 730.;
1|1|please do not purchase , totally wastege of money , believe me ,u can purchase other mi phone but dont purchase this set , totally wastege of money even your other friend is satisfied with this mobile , but u should be carefull , do not purchse this set
1|1|My dear friends I m using it for the last 1.5 months, dont go for the reason a single tag line for mi4i "Plz Dont Buy"
1|2|I m using his phone over 1 n half moth (as replaced once) 1. Speaker volume very low. when i m playing songs or talking over hands-free mode, from maximum value the speaker volume reduces to an inaudible low level automatically after 3 to 4 seconds. i replaced my first phone thinking particular handset problem but second set also has same problem so waiting for next replacement. 2. i m not a gamer or continuous browser with data or wi fi on but battery drains out faster. with moderate use only 16 to 20 hrs of life, seems like 2100 mah not 3100. 3. Mic problem. no audibility on other side. 4. wifi, blue tooth n network connectivity is poor....... dont seems like higher version of BT, 4G n wi fi. 5 Screen blinks automatically bet two apps 15 to 20 times without touching anything 6. user available memory very less Good Camera (front n rear) super display slim, light weight n best design cool features
0|5|This is my first Xiaomi mobile so I was like yourself digging through reviews to know about every pro and con on the list. But guys actually its a great smartphone. Multitasking is a breeze on this one. The camera quality is awesome. And the two tone flash is mind blowing (it actually lit up a whole dark room). Front camera is great for selfies as it has a wide angle lens (I took a photo with it for my job application!!!). What I liked the most about this phone is the screen. Its vivid, great viewing angles, sunlight legibility is very good. I don't know what the sensor is called but if you turn the auto brightness on, you don't have to worry about reading the screen even on the brightest day. Its got 441ppi display which is really crisp and small font sizes looks great. But the 1920x1080 display draws the power from battery faster if the brightness is full. I keep it on a medium level which gives almost a day after 3G surfing, video and music, playing games etc. The device has 2 GB of ram, 16 GB internal (around 12.2 GB available after default Google apps installs which will be asked by the device when you first setup you phone) and adreno405 GPU which combine to give an overall smooth performance. Games don't give any hitch (I can't tell if you plan to play very high end games) like Angry birds, temple run, asphalt 8, FIFA and so on. The user interface is MIUI6 which is smooth and user friendly. But I think there are thousands (maybe millions) of launchers available from different app stores online which can be installed. There is theme support from Mi theme store which have many (a lot!) free themes available. So finally for those busy guys, the quick pros and cons... For the first time - Pros and cons: 1. 5" 1920x1080 screen (Very compact suitable for single handed use) 2. Octa core 1.7 GHz CPU 3. 2 GB RAM (800-900 MB will be free if Google apps are installed but don't worry multitasking is breeze). 4. Adreno405 gives smooth gaming. 5. 13 MP Sony lens which snaps very great images under sunlight & low light too. 6. 5 MP selfie camera with 3 modes of beatification (hear that girls???) 7. Dual tone flash (will give you a day like effect). 8. 16 GB internal (12 GB free, enough for many things). 9. Dual sim (Both support 4G but you can use 4G on only one sim at a time). 10. Speaker output is not great but clear and crisp enough for a room. 11. Very slim and compact and beautiful looking (I have the grey version). 12. USB OTG support. 13. No micro SD expansion (if you still think 12 gigs and OTG is not enough) 14. Output through headphones is great. 15. Just buy it and see for yourself (I'm sure you won't regret).
0|5|product is good games r playing well light weight camera is too good i was using it but accessories not available let see how it go
0|4|got the phone the very second day at kochi. fast delivery by flipkart. nice body design. no heating problems. at first experienced problems in getting whatsapp etc over mobile networks. after giving permissions to the app and correcting the APN settings the problem got solved. quality of camera is excellent. installed scanning app and got super scanned documents. very useful in scanning documents while on travel. and the pictures also very bright even in night. no slot for SD card. but 16 GB devise memory is enough for my use. SAR value is high (so i am reducing one star). overall a good phone.
0|3|May kindly manufacture this problem i.e. Sim slot is not proper working and its not loading the second sim. Thanks
1|5|after heavy usage for past 4 days , I am writing review pros : 1.very slim and light weight hold in hands , easily use single hand 2.good display 3. better battery backup , heavy usage - one day life 4.multi tasking good , no hanging prob 5. No heating issue noticeable - Most reviews point out this have heating prob , 1 hour 3g surfing no heat found 6. free RAM around 1gb after installing many apps too 7.LED notification 8. Camera rear and front - upto the mark - best cons : 1. No sd card support - only 16gb internal memory , but otg pendrive supports 2. speaker volume little bit low overall very good spec mobile at this price range , just go for it - u never regret ...
1|5|i dont know if there is something is wrong with my charger.it worked for a month.now it has stopped working.the phone is great.if you are going to buy,buy it for the software,camera,design
0|5|Does give a full day battery even though it might get heated sometimes during heavy working, But overall a good device in this price range but main thing is the camera. I love it.
0|2|Camera is pathetic in low lights , heats up while using internet for long periods Sound is alo on lower side. dont buy instead buy redmi 2 or mi4 if your budget allows
1|2|Heating too much even i am using just whatsapp and after update it looses its functionality, the web browser is too slow after update only buy if you are happy too keep a heated phone in your pocket
0|4|good product at 13k..Performance and battery life is good. Heating problem still exist. So giving 4 start out of 5
0|5|1.Superb camera...... 2.Good battery ....... 3.Awesome performance....... 4.excellentt MIUI...... the phone is awesome in this price range...
0|4|4i is nice phone,nice display qwality,nice speed,nice touch,but rear camera is poor,and batery backup in nice,3g speed is slow,and i using mi 4i is 2 months
0|5|Unibody Design, Ultra-compact Frame 2nd-gen Snapdragon 615 Processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB Flash 12.7 cm Sharp/JDI 1080p Display All-new Sunlight Display, Corning OGS Glass 13MP Sony /Samsung Camera f/2.0 aperture, Two-tone Flash 5MP Front Camera with Beautify 4.4V 3120 mAh Battery, 4G Dual SIM MIUI 6 on Andro Mi4i IS WAY MORE THEN THIS !
0|4|It is a great phone with power pack performance and features and without using this phone no one can judge its quality its just too awesome. Go for it.
0|4|Mi4i most sleek nd elegant design. Awesome camera, good batery backup. value for money. Very smooth experience till now.
0|1|dnt even think to buy this mobile worst mobiile i ever use. even small game hanging ....i asked for replacement bt three times they rejected.... they telling 2gb ram bt 256mb nt full worst mobile nd worst website dnt buy here.....frm flipkart
0|3|thought first flagship launch in India would be awesome but to much gung ho but Redmi Note 3G was much better than it.... sound is such poor that phone kept on ringing on desk you hardly notice, lots of glitch in software too but no heating issue as mentioned by lots of people and smooth in using
1|1|dont ever buy this product.only specs but no performance the phone get heated up and drains alot.and regarding customer support its the worst.u wont get any spare parts as they dont have any back up of spare parts. i m waiting for a spare parts for now 25 days now and the sc doesnot even give proper replies neither give expected time for repair...after buy you u will only repent.better to go with other brands dan this.atleast they hav good customer support.
1|2|Quite a few features not working and some reminder apps not working properly. Battery is good. Display is good. Processor speed is just decent enough.
0|1|phone is heating rapidly ; worst battery backup; no extra sd card no removable battery; if you purchase this mobile youhave to purchase immediatly power banks orelse no use; no vedio calls ;above all camera quality is good;keeping simcards in mobile is different, NOT GOOD, don't expect much about this mobile
0|1|there is now sound problem and camera and speaking not working properly, its not a month also so not satisfied with this new mobile.
0|3|I don't understand the use of any MI phones, of-course this phone has a stunning display and specs...but useless, you cannot use this phone for more than 12- 15 minutes, it will get so hot you cannot hold this device.. next time i will prefer to buy a branded phone which will sure be of some use Pros- Display - Battery backup (i am neutral to this as it is not possible to use mobile for long times) - Camera - Good Design and build (But back panel is Slippery and some knocking sound at back) - Quick in normal uses Cons- heating after 12-15 minutes, Too many Software glitches,Sound is bit low, microphone will not work if you are on call and you are holding the phone from bottom.
0|5|First word comes out is WOW... as soon you open the box and have feel of this amazing mobile. seriously after i loose hope from my samsung galaxy grand duos I was looking for something as advanced and reasonable priced mobile phone I did compare a lot of phones and found mi4i as per my expectation, i was bit worried about it's temperature reviews but to be honest all who cry for this phone sorry for them! This phone is one of the best mobile in it's class and atleast 5 times better then samsung or any other available product in it's range and beyond. Xioami could have priced it easily 15000.INR but for 12999.00 it's more then it's value. all the feature work beyond the expectation, but yes it lags a tiny bit while using camera. It dose heat up if you play games on it for longer but not that would burn your hand. camera is wonderful and the best feature of this mobile, light weight and slimness is feather in cap. switching from one task to another is just a click without any lagging. If you get a chance to buy this mobile phone don't think twice.
0|5|mi4i 16gb best smartphone slim n trim clarity n speed ***** update is good gb is less(-) point flipkart product is good brand n delivery is the best part of online shoping to flipkart
0|5|FUlly Satisfied with the best product. camera is good, full hd screen, and awesome speed at this price. got more than the price i paid
1|4|Nice phone. Using it from last 2 months. Not faced even a single issue. The phone heats a bit but it is ok. Display, Speed all is very good. One negative... the speaker volume is a bit low. although it is not a big issue.
0|5|Good phone to have. Great resolution and no heating issues so far in my 1 week's use. Great battery life. The phone is very slim and delicate as well.
0|5|Mi4i is really a great mobile with a lots of useful features. But I think Xiaomi should improve the camera quality a little bit . I request Xiaomi to expand the internal storage upto 32gb. Somehow I can manage in 16gb Its very less better make it 32gb or more
0|5|This is very nice phone. Value for money in this price range. The best feature I like is it is having best photo quality for both front and rear. There lots of effects which are directly available in camera. they have latest updated the phone for more performance and heat control I am using for 2 months and it is perfect for me.
0|5|Excellent mid-range phone, superb camera, fast gaming, amazing new features. A must buy phone for anyone.
0|5|It is absolute worth for 12,999/-. Thanks to MI for providing such wonderful product. I have been using this product since three weeks, its smooth and silky. Believe me I felt that I am handling a premium phone worth above 25k. Coming to heating problem, I updated the 6.5.6 version as soon as I unpacked, no heating issues at all. Its slightly get heated up if you are watching a movie for 2 hours. I got a Samsung note 2, it does get heated up, when I watch a movie. So, it's just normal if you use any mobile for a longer duration. For everyone who is cribbing about the heating issue, download 6.5.6 update and it's solved Fantastic 4G connectivity. Overall, it's just worth every Penny. Thanks to Flipkart.
0|4|i have been using this phone for a month now .......its really very good ....the most i wanted to buy this phone for its excellent battery life and it is really good it goes without charging for 1.5 days .........the sunlight display is awesome ........the processor is really good .............overall a gr8 buy in this range ......good product by xiaomi ........nd delievered withing time by flipkart
0|1|This is my first Xiaomi phone and I am sure I am not going to buy Xiaomi ever. It only looks good on paper. It has 2gb ram Octa core blah blah. But when you actually use it, it give performance lower then Redmi 1. It lags every time. Even if I open some web page in chrome it starts lagging. What should I do with 2gb ram and Octa core if I can't even open a webpage. I bought it from Flipkart, it had heating issue. It went upto 60 degrees while opening some pages in chrome. Got it replaced and now it goes up to 40 - 43 but lags like hell. It would be better if you go with other options like Moto or HTC rather then wasting your money on this crapy phone.
0|4|No SD card rest are fine, Nice camera, display is also fine but ya while playing games you feel lag sometimes.
1|4|Marvellous display, good battery, compact and sleek, but should be with accessories like screen guard, flip cover and headphone/ Hope in time to com Xiaomi will be with wireless battery soon. sad part is they don't deliver the accesory to the place where my phone was delivered.
0|5|Great phone . . Great specs . . Awesome Camera quality . . Less RAM available but still good performance. .
0|4|The only drawback is it does not has expandable memory....rest every thing works gr8! You can compare the phone display with iphone 6 infact better then the later one. Dont think before buying...
0|5|its is fast working. look is very stylish of any fone that I have seen. Slim and handy. The grey color is awesome. screen display is best. Very crystal clear video display. Only need this to be little cheaper say upto 11 to 12k. But still it is cheaper in its section. go for it
0|5|I was not a MI fan. However I still purchased this phone based on its good reviews. And indeed it was a great decision. The phone is way better than I imagined. I am happy with this phone. Only limitation is its 16 GB memory which is similar to my iphone.
0|5|I bought this mobile on 18th June Sale. Received it timely. I must say great mobile and great look with killing features and themes. You won't believe that you are actually using Android Version.
0|4|Hi all this is my 1 phone from mi and it is amazing. i was indeed impressed with its features but there are some heating issues but this phone is awesome.
0|4|Excellent Phone and Excellent Service By Flipkart ........................... ............................. ........................
0|2|Everything is good about the phone except the below. 1. Heating Problem: Still facing the heating issue, even after the 850 MB update. Phone gets heated even on normal usage. When playing games, if you receive a call, then be prepared to burn your ears. I am using this phone since 1 month; I have burnt my fingers holding this phone. I can feel the burning sensation on my fingers. 2. Battery: It gets drained very fast, even on normal usage. 3. Storage: You have to limit yourself to particular/favourite songs and movies. 4. Games: Sometimes there is a slight delay even when playing games like subway surfer.
0|5|Best mobile phone at this range, i am using for the past 2 months working without any problem. Picture quality in the Camera is very good. Worth buying this product.
0|3|i was very excited when i got my phone later it was good but the phone got heated so much and then i was getting used to it and on the tenth day of my purchase the display wasnt working i have ordered for new piece now
1|2|Heating Issue, Sometimes it heat up like you can cook food over it. otherwise its above okay phone... better compare with other company mobiles too.
0|2|I purchased this phone just few weeks back. There are lot of problems - 1. Phone gets heated very quickly 2. Poor battery life 3. Very much frustrating - Mobile data with aircel 3g does not work even after correct settings. The icon shows its connected but there is no speed. Every time I need to enable and disable mobile data. Poor product. WASTE OF MONEY!! Please be careful while purchasing this phone as my friends are also facing the same issue
0|3|Battery back up is not up to expected level and it is having heating problem, flipkart sent within the specified delivery time
0|5|For the price this is quite good.. Would have loved a better Graphics processor than the Adreno 405.. But overall nice phone.. The camera is amazing.. The MIUI6 is a downgrade in some areas where they've oversimplified things.. Pros: Price, Camera both front and rear (and the beautification feature), Weight, Screen Case Matte texture Cons: Little Larger area for capacitative buttons. As it can lose some screen area when you put a case cover especially the silicon protective types. And you'll end up touching the interface instead of buttons No Corning Gorilla Glass but "Corning Scratch Resistant" Glass (already got one scratch) Oversimplification of GUI in MIUI6. Other than that none so far. @Xiaomi - we are not exactly fans of Apple so don't go that route so much.. flat interface is OK.. but we androidians like the flexibility of Android platform. Xiaomi's in family: this Mi4i, Mi3 (2 actually 1 is stolen now), Redmi 1s, Redmi 2, Redmi Note 4G
0|3|With in 2 weeks when i buyer this product ... Mi4 16 Gb is released around same price ... Could have gone for it . With respect to this . Has premium feel . Speakers bit less louder . Camera is nice for this price range . Gets bit heated up while playing Candy Crush !!!
0|5|This is one amazing phone at this price. And it has lived upto its expectations! Just close your eyes and go for it. It really is a flagship phone! PROS: Display Camera (Both front and rear) OS Mi UI Touch All new sunlight display Music system Call interface CONS: Storage That is it. Just go for it!!!
0|5|Great phone with stunning display Absolutely no heating problem as mentioned in many reviews. smooth performance
0|5|his is one of the best built mobiles under 15000 in terms of performance, Build Quality, Performance, Display Quality and ease of using its great user interface. Eagerly Waiting for Mi 5
0|5|Simply awesome very little flaws that can be easily ignored by the eye lighting pros Hats off to flipkart delivery services and coustmer service support A must buy phone
0|3|Pros: Excellent Display. Excellent battery backup. Good notification led Good camera. Cons: Average Performance Camera Pictures - Zooming cause noisy images. RAM - only 700 MB available for usage even after clearing cache Tight chager port.
1|5|As before buying this phone i was worried whether this phone is worth of 13000 (12999 phone 1 sim) but after when i use this phone i was greatly satisfied with this company. The display of mi4i is really crystal clear The camera of mi4i also work best in day time and night time, the due tone flash work well. The battery is capable to give 2 days of usage After 30 min of gaming i have not feel the phone hot it was little warm which is natural. over all the phone is really best and worth of money so bereave me buy this phone with out any hesitation. lots of people say that this phone has storage problem but this phone supports OTG you can use USB cable to store more amount of data.
0|1|I have replaced product 3rd time due to light bleed issue below the buttons. The third phone is having heating issue . Flipkart technical team said 5 to 50 degree is normal for MI4i . Can anyone hold phone on ear while it is heated upto 50 degree. . they have rejected my return , phone is heating while playing game and on call . no other background application is running. but flipkart technical team is not accepting .in 1 minute on the call of technical team phone temp is raised 1 degree .. still they saying that it is normal ...... buy this phone if you can handle hot objects....you can press your shirt after you play a game for half hour on this mobile... it will be heated upto 46 degree in half hour
0|5|a perfect choice for perfect people a small phone with lots of features go buy it quickly good looking good working good interface gorgeous display light weight
1|2|Cons You get only 936 Mb ram for user out of the box. Handset warms up on just 10 mins of Browsing usage. However It doesn't on calls. Its lagging when using miracast for screen sharing. Pros Looks elegant and stylish Light weight Good display and viewing angles
0|4|I like this phone just because of the performance. Its complementary that you get the powerful hardware too.Just go for it.
0|5|Best in class, value for money. Super camera, both front and rear. Could have given black color back option
0|5|I AM LIKING THIS PHONE VERY MUCH. FEATURES ARE AT PAR WITH WELL KNOWN BRANDS AND ITS PRICE IS ALSO POCKET FRIENDLY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO MY FRIENDS.
0|5|Bot this phone after a lot of research, it was worth the wait. No problems what so ever until now like over heating restarts etc etc... Happy with my new phone!!
0|5|I ordered this product last Wednesday and I got it this Monday. They delivered it before the scheduled time. For delivery is 5 stars. About the phone: It's light weight, sleek, good camera and performance is good as far as i know. And for this price, its just osm..
0|5|kamal ka phone hai maja aga use kar ke bas ek card slot ke kami the but otg se maine pura kar liya and meri delivery bahut late kar de aap ne that not fare
0|4|HI i recently bought this mi4i phone phone is absolutely beautiful and stunning .Light weight,stunnung display and camera on 4g works beautifully.
0|5|Good product, worth buying. MIUI very user friendly, highly customizable. Individual app can be controlled for for security and notifications.
0|5|Best in Class. Good Performance. Not Warming Up too much. Thinny, Skinny, Smart to have one Need not to replace this for next three years at least. So, features are quite impressive
0|1|Delivery was in time , Mobile looks great . But gets heated up and you an make an omlette . Also voice clarity on speaker is pathetic
0|5|Worth money.... Noone gives snapdragon processor for such a cheap price... Camera quality is awesome.... I had xperia Z before MI4i and can say that camera,sound quality are better than sony! Moreover its MIUI the best UI known.... You'll always get updates for your phone.... As there are plenty of developers for the phone... Battery life is superb...
0|3|I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now, The phone is above average in performance. The only 2 problems I have faced are: 1) The WiFi connects to my MTNL modem in my house but the internet access does not start. I have to so many time switch it off and on then it may start. Sometimes, I have also to use Mobile Data when the net doesn't start in emergency. 2) There is a light leakage below the Home and Back button downside, which is only visible in dark. Rest the phone is ok if only these issues tacked.
0|5|Outstanding performance. Nothing to describe. No heating issues. Unbelievable camera with auto beautify.4G speed is also awesome. Overall best phon of Xiaomi.
1|5|my next phone is mi 4 but i want when it get 4g or mi note pro is also soooooo good. But all these phones have a little heating issue company have to do something soon.
0|1|Xiomi has taken Indians for granted and have released this product. The image quality from camera in Low light is pathetic lot of granuels, it is decent during normal lightings. If phone is operated in multi task mode, it generates enough heat using which a small cloth can be pressed [ironed]. Other features of the phone is normal when compared to other devices in the same price band. Strong recommendation, to not buy this phone, device heating is very severe and may cause damage to the user.
0|3|I bought this product on flash sale, reading the descriptions and reviews and everything. Good things are: 1) Good display 2) Good Camera clarity and zooming 3) Interface is beautiful 4) Performance is good 5) Network speed is good. 6) Music clarity is good. But no bass. I think they made bass to 0 to make a feel of good clarity. Bad things are: 1) Heating issue when playing games, using map, mobile data, camera 2) Very low volume for speakers. You will miss a lot of calls. And when playing mp3 also very low volume. This is a very crucial issue for me 3) Low battery backup. The battery back is for maximum one day only. Not a single minute more than that. In case of volume issue, they saying its a software problem and they are fixing it. Don't know more about that. So think before you buy this product.
0|5|i like almost every thing about this phone. the UI is stunning. Great work Xiaomi. Flipkart guys continue the great work, got this phone delivered within three days
0|5|Reading so many negative reviews about heating issues in Mi4i I was worried before i bought it. Now its about a month i have been using it and till now there is no heating problem at all. Superb battery backup. Runs a complete day with full charged battery with extended uses (games, calls, chats, songs) etc. So to be honest, i am happy with the investment.
0|4|Looks Really good Mobile with a price tag it is coming. Loved. Will Suggest others to go for it. Lots of option to customise. Would be better if xiomi increase storage capacity. Regards!
0|3|In this mobile apps lock is not working properly. Kindly guide which apps lock is suitable for mi4i. Urgent..............
0|5|very good item in this budget , the quality also nice in this budget you cant get more from any brand.
1|4|A Brilliant phone from Xiaomi, worth every penny you pay. It's a very smooth functioning phone and the display is bright and very clear. Doesn't heat, has very good battery life.Lasts for more than a day even when my data roaming was on, with using apps. Been using since a month and have no complaints. Has every single thing you need in an android nowadays, actually more than that!
0|5|Good! very decent product, excellent service by flipkart. But could be better if it was offered with accessories too...
0|1|the worst phone i ever had. No display, bad sound.... itys display damage within 16 daYS... ti just to tell you plzzz dont buy that product of xiaomi...its a wastage of money.
0|2|worst phone. heats very fast. back camera - very poor quality, looks loike only 3.2 MPXL battery dains very fast while gaming and camera usage. sunlight sensor is not working properly. \
0|5|Great features & very good choice for me... no more hardware problems... battery performance is good... processor is too good... but i feel one problem that sound is too low...
0|5|First of all thank you FlipKart by delivering this Product Quickly. the Looks of this phone is awesome..slim..and with attractive look. after first boot and after some updates mi4i works smoothly.. No Heating issue at all after the updates of MUI.. the Voice clarity is 10/10. WiFi, Bluetooth, even 4 G connections works perfectly for both sims. the display is awesome..battery life is good.. Even Bigger games can be played smoothly..no lag at all. Ringer is not that much louder..
0|5|VFM mobile... Using from last 10 days... no issue... everything is going good... Camera resolution is superb and front cam also great. very smooth and fast. FHD display is mind-blowing... Go for it...
0|4|very good phone.. liked everything about it. design, performance n everything. However my 1st Mi4i's front camera was defective. The replacement is on the way.. thanks to flipkart.
0|4|the product is very nice and the speed of browsing is very nice by 3G network and also for 2G network. i like for design
0|3|HI I Had faced the problem with video callling and i had replaced with new one but it problem not resolve and i had cancelled it. if any one want to talk on skype, please don't purchase till company fix the problem. remaining things are fine
0|4|The mobile phone is too good. btt it's hit in use of only 5 mins. Camera is also good. Little sound problem.
0|1|lot of lagging problem. completely hangs sometimes after installation of new apps. output of sound is very low. unable to hear when the phone rings
0|1|NA...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|5|No issue whatsoever, Doesn't heat that much contrary to popular believe. Compact with good battery and screen, What else does one need?
0|4|Overall its a good phone, but lack with Sound quality. Very poor speakers does not give good sound on high volume as well.
0|3|Have used it extensively in the last two days. While most performance is fine, there is a bug with the mini USB port as it has a charging issue. The port goes dead and does not charge when plugged to a socket and need phone need to be rebooted to get it ti charge
0|5|I purchased in the first flash sale and its been about two months since I'm using it. When I received the phone I was really amazed by the quality, look, display and the camera also a good battery backup. It had heating issue when heavy tasks but with later updates it was fixed but yes the performance was slightly down as well, but even now if you switch to performance mode its a beast, buttery smooth but heats up after 10 min. So balanced mode is perfect and if u are playing graphic intense ones u can opt for performance mode. In performance mode the temperature would shoot upto 50 degrees. But doesnt matter for me as Im not a hardcore gamer. Im a hobbiest photographer and this phone takes seriously very good images on day light and twilight. Not great at low light, too much digital noise. Front camera is also good but not great. I really dont like the noise when low lit indoors. They should try to fix that at least for next update. I would have loved to see an SD card slot, then it would have been a runaway hit Im sure. Also the lack of accessories availability is also a concern. You can find the pics taken with mi4i in facebook with #Xiaomipics. Its really a good buy. Sound through headphone is just amazing. Loudspeaker is good but a bit low I feel. Have seen many negative comments most probably they havent updated the phone and they just jump into conclusions. If you are still concerned then you can opt for bigger porche brands,spend double to triple of this phone.
0|4|Excellent phone, superb battery life, touch is very good, light weight great design. Very good back camera and superb front camera. You will surprise to see your selfie for sure. Sometime the phone starts to heat up and that's the only cons and you won't get any accessories with this. So earphones you need to buy... Go for it... It's that good...
1|4|Moving smoothely my 3rd day having good battery life(me downloadding so many apps n thing n watching videos ) so satisfied with this product although slightly uncomfortable in keeping in hand for long time may be my previous phone is shorter comparitively ..
0|5|I was skeptical about this phone after reading reviews. But still went with it after exchanging my nexus 4. After using for a week now it seems a good buy. - Quite good camera (front cam also nice) - Good battery backup of around 1.5 days. (with all time either on wifi or 3G/4G and bluetooth with moto 360) - Amazing 4G speed with airtel. - Very sharp and good display. - MIUI is good with lots of nice features but I think replacing it with pure android will be good. The only bad thing about the phone is that it does not support encryption, hence lot of corporate emails won't work directly. I no longer access my corp mail on it !!
0|1|Mobile is heating up baddly and showing some error on screend during power off and on. Customer care exicutive just say to update mobile but still problem is there.
0|5|What a Phone..... The First Thing That Impress is Build Quality and also the Screen is Also So Beautiful a Compact 5" Display.... not So Big and not Too Small.... and also it is Full HD Display.... Second thing Both Camera are Good... Rear Camera has Good Result and too much camera effect are included.... also it has manual mode,low light mode.... The Front Camera is Superb.... it is Better than Lumia 730 Front Camera... Batter Backup Is about 20-24 hours.... 3G normal Use... A Great Thing is It Has MIUI 6 Lolipop Edition... This User Interface is Simple,Colourfull,Full Funcationable....it feels Smooth Stable... It not gives Android Feel... But It Awesome... This Phone is Coming with Snapdragon At This Price range..with Octa core..... The Sound Cons... Not Memory Card Slot.... User Memory is only 12.7 GB.. Some 4K Videoes are not Working with MI Video Player and MX Player.. No Handset in Box... No Accessories in Market...
0|5|I have been using it for almost two weeks now and I am in love with my Mi 4i. The moment I unboxed it only thing I felt was that how slim, light weight and beautiful looking this phone is. It is very light(as light as iphone 6), lighter then most of the phones(even the smaller phones like MMX A1). Its back is nice and not at all slippery. White color looks very beautiful(I think even better than the grey one). This phone has an awesome display, the best you can get under 15k. Outdoor viewing is great, thanks to the sunlight display technology. It has nice viewing angles. After using this phone the other phone's displays like moto g or MMX nitro look bad. Battery life is superb. It lasts for me on an average almost two days. Camera is great for the price, especially the front one. Nice features in the camera app are available. MIUI 6 is nice looking and gives a great feel(looks like iOS). But it somewhat reduces the actual performance of the phone. Speaker is good but the ringer volume is not that high. Performance is good only but not that great:Not for Very Heavy Gaming but great for normal gaming, browsing and other usage. NO HEATING ISSUES FACED BY ME.
0|5|Thanks flipkart for a faster delivery i am writing this review after 72 hours usage of my new xiaomi mi 4i mi 4i the best flagship under 15k that i have ever seen the phone comes with snapdraon 615 and miui 6.5.6.0 in the 6.5.6.0 xiaomi added thermal algorithm to prevent heating and increased volume quality from rear speaker after getting mi 4i i played asphalt 8 airborne for a continuous period of 4 hours a little bit heating is observed at the back. while playing asphalt battery temp always remained less than 40 degree which is the best for a smartphone PROS:- 1:brilliant display 2:sunlight display makes the display more viewable on heavy light 3.premium light weight design:weighing only 130 gm 4:Ram:After first boot it gives around 1 gb ram while using fb messenger,skype,whatsapp around 650 mb is always free and we can lock apps on ram 5:Stunnig front cam;selfies look more beautiful while the rear cam is average 6:stunning graphics while playing games 7;battery gives a very good backup 8:miui 6 which is the best world class rom 9: memory around 10.7 gb free after the bulky android lolipop Cons:- 1:no sd card slot 2:rear cam performance should be improved on conclusion mi4i is the best smartphone on performance,battery,light weight and display no need to think man go for it
1|1|I purchased this phone 15 days back. after updating to MIUI to 6.5.5.0. this phone started giving problem in front camera. front camera is getting dull in low light. I am writing everyday e-mails to customer care but they have stopped responding me after giving five to six solution expariments. I saw there are lot of customers like me facing problems a Xaiomi customer community page. I advise people please let Mi fix this problem then only plan to buy this phone. internal memory of this phone is also very low (16GB) which can be good for beginers. customer service of Mi is very poor.
0|5|DEAR ALL, AM USING THIS AND I AM MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. SAMSUNG PHONES ARE NOT LOST LIKE NOKIA. DON'T THINK ITS A CHINESE COMPANY BUT THINK ABOUT THE HARDWARE AND SPECS THAT YOU ARE GETTING WITH THIS PRICE RANGE. NO HEATING ISSUE AT ALL. AWESOME PHONE.
1|4|Flipkart's service was really good. For the first time when I turned it on and charged it, I overheated. I was kinda worried. But that didn't turn out to be a issue. The phone's working fine now and is really fast compared to other Android phones. The camera's awesome. HDR's are too good. Sharp images. Touch is good. Everything's fine with the phone. You don't have to worry about it for a long time once you've purchased. I can assure that. Good Luck.
0|5|i like it very much 1.5 months of use no problem, go for it blindly, its w very gud mobile, spl, privecy n display, n camera, i recommend it for everyone who want better mobile in cheap rate
0|1|The experince of using Mi4i has been awful, appalling, disgusting. From scond day of purchage, the front camera has stoped functioning due to some malfunction in software and I am being harrased to get the resolution. I will not suggest anyone to buy any technical prod to any of my acquaintance.
0|3|I bought this phone exactly a month back. Read a lot and then i decided to buy this phone. I have one apple 4s and had been using a q5 blackberry before this phone. I am a moderate to heavy user with calls about 30-50 calls a day with approx 5 min durations, net surfing for about 45 mins to 1 hr, kindle reading about again 45 mins, whatsapp and facebook for 20 mins about. this all is done on H+ network. let me now share the experience of this phone: Pros: Camera quality good, both front and back flash is good as well Screen response good. miui good , but did hang twice while multi processing The network reception is good. Cons: Ringtone really is on the lower side, many a times u can not hear the phone ringing The LED for notification behaves erratically The heating issue is arbitrary but is definitely there, mostly while surfing for longer durations.( i have upgraded to the recent firmware). Battery even though theoretically big will support you for about 18 hrs, mostly due to display. Do have problems sometimes with the voice quality as there is echo,maybe problem of my network but never had this issue with q5. Truecaller is a little buggy on MIUI. As a package the phone is okay and for this price if u want a good snapper you can go for it,hopefully heating issue will be resolved soon with some update.
1|4|Pros : 1) Superb look and feel 2) Superb camera performance (both selfie and rear) 3) Performance better 4) High resolution and ppi 5) Light weight so after putting in case also doesn't feel heavy in pocket Cons: 1) Battery takes long time to fully charge but lasts only a day in nominal use. 2) Some heating problem which reduced of late. 3) No expendable memory (though not required for the general user) 4) Back panel is so smooth that slips out of hand 5) No information for removing the back panel.
0|1|Pros: * Great Full HD LCD screen. * Pretty decent battery life. * MIUI6 has some interesting detailed features like a vibrate alert when a call is picked-up, ability to turn on flashlight without unlocking the phone etc. Cons: * Goes off network after sometime in standby. This is a critical issue. Nobody will be able to reach you, so you will NEED to activate missed-call alert. * Charging does not work randomly. A restart is needed. This is another major issue. * MIUI is not refined compared to Google's original Android UI as seen on Nexus and Moto X/Moto G/Moto E. * Laggy and jerky UI performance. * Not great value-for-money when the competition is Moto G. * Has only Qualcomm Quick Charge 1.0 which does charging at 5V 2.1A which is an expected feature in 2015. Nothing outstanding like Mi 4's Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. * Beware of Flipkart's 30-day return policy. There is no such thing, at least on this item - so I was told by the call-centre. Overall: Too many random critical issues makes this phone a no buy. However the phone works and is good for the money for those looking for a Full HD display to watch movies and it has decent battery-life.
0|4|this mi phone is looking awesome camera is also good this is the best mobile in this price speaker is not good it is so slim and light in weight
0|5|Display 12/10 The Best Camera 9/10 Great but sometimes some images are not that great Design 9/10 hmmmmm kinda ok Software 10/10 MIUI as expected the Best custom rom availabe so no problem with that Note:- Almost no Heating after the latest update.. Just go for it Don't Think..
0|4|non gamer... moderate user... more than 10hrs wifi usage (chrome, quora, whatapp, youtube, fb etc), 1-2 hrs songs, 30 min light games. using Mi4i since 1 month, updated to MiUI 6.5.5.0 with first 800mb update Pros: 1. excellent battery backup. very easily lasts a day, sometimes even a day and a half. I charge the phone mostly upto 100% and discharge it almost completely 2-5% before recharging it. 2. Doesn't heat much as written in other comments. its already hot summers in India, it will obviously become hot a bit. however, battery temp doesn't reach more than 43-44 degrees after long gaming. no heating during calling. 3. great camera in daylight conditions. Front camera is great for selfies. Refocus mode is great feature. 4. best display ever seen.. just fabulous, automatic brightness adjustment makes everything visible even in bright sunlight. 5. otg compatible .. no issues found 6. MiUI no unwanted unused apps as in samsung sony, customised android, great interface, although some features copied from apple, yet MiUI looks great. 7. looks very elegant in hand... just awesome looks.. sleek phone. just perfect size to hold in hand. even has one-hand mode Cons 1. Speaker volume is bit low. not very big issue. especially while running videos (online or from internal memory), but strangely music player produces good volume. default ringtones are melodious but sometimes inaudible, hence I use some high pitched songs as my ringtone to overcome this. almost inaudible (even when listening music) at low volume level. 2. low light camera photos are a bit dissatisfying. could be improved. 3. RAM less than 1 gb (around 800-900Mb) is usable. but rarely gets laggy. however, Runs very smoothly in performance mode on even heavy usage. 4. full charging takes a bit time (3hrs ).. big battery, but that's why it lasts long 100% recommended.... highly satisfied with this phone
0|5|At first, heating was there like all phones. Now after a few updates, no issues. Display is awesome. We cannot find similar display in phones under 20k. Slim and lightweight even with a 3000 mah battery. And in my opinion, only ios can beat MIUI 6.
0|1|Phone Screen not working within 10 days of using. Brand new phone very well taken care of, still gone faulty within 10 days.
0|4|Name is Chinese but performance and looks and quality like branded one. very nice.. first time i saw , this ph doesn't has any charging heating issues like other ph(i.e samsung , sony phs do).it's like It came from china but behave like a Korean brand and other company like Samsung and sony came from Korea but behave like a China ph.... Overall rating for this phone : Design : 9/10. Performance : 8/10 (no lag at all) No that much heating issues but sightly heating issue in gaming mode [All ph on the market has the same heating issue so don't make it as a issue for this ph] but after update it definitely improves. UX [MIUI 6 ] : 8/10 Camera : 8.5/10 Video : 8.5/10 go for it ...you will come to know ,how much other giant brand is making us fool...
0|4|I have been using this phone for almost a month now. And here is my verdict- Even after all the updates this phone gets heated easily. You cant use the phone while its on charge because the temperatures go high and there is throttling. Even if you use the phone for general purposes then also it gets heated. Even during long calls. Storage space remains a problem. 16gb is not quite enough. Apart from the heating issue this is a truly wonderful phone.The phone is also quite handy and feels solid. . MIUI is unbeatable and so is the camera .. well you can't get a better camera in this price range. Easily usable in one hand. If you don't mind getting a phone greater than 5" then I would say go for either Zenfone 2 or HTC phones. I purchased this phone because I wanted MIUI (Crazy for it) and 5" screen, wanted one hand use.
0|2|i am writing this review after using one month.this is not what i had expected.its average phone.its rear camera is good.look wise awosome. but major drawback is its battery which drain very fast. heating is another major problem with it.overall its average phone.i will not reccomend to buy it
0|4|I Bought this phone 1 week ago. I didn't face heating issue, phone design and performance is really awesome in this range. good to buy.
0|5|This mobile has ultimate features as already described in it's feature list. I am using this from 1 month and purchased it in first flagship sell. Flipkart delivered it to me before scheduled date. I did not face any problem till date. Thanks to all team members to amaze your customers.
1|5|Performance and features are good within this price, Tracing the phone even with IMEI no is difficult. I have purchased mobile last week of MAY and it is lost within 3 weeks, Iam unable to get it approached possible sources. Can anyone suggest to track the phone. Krishna
0|4|awesome phone with smart price..processor super quality~looks sleem & thin ~smart phone better one than others ~~
0|5|I have use mi4i 4 5 days and following are my experience.. -heating problem while high graphics games. upto 43 C -camera is pretty decent and clear m loving it.best for selfie . -Battery backup is good and charging is fast 3 hr for stand by charging , on 2g battery backup 18 hr ,3g 13 hr. -Display is the best part of it as it is too smooth hadn't seen such display before.(441ppl) -net speed is too fast as other. ..... solutions to problem: --Uninstall FLipkart, Flesky and Google chrome... as its browser is better than chrome. --update into new and stable version.. yeah update came the day i got it(pretty amazed). --the design is good n is too light. -- and it doesnot have a SD slot because phone with SD slot tends to hang more so there r no SD slots in iphone too (same iphone 5s)
0|3|Smart phone in real sense. Good picture quality. Voice clarity is good. Battery backup is excellent. Sleek model. Light weight.
0|5|This phone is too good. Great Battery life. Dual SIM and Superb camera which I can compare to quality of Note 4. All this and more at such a low price. Only dissapointment was my charger stopped working so will be taking it to the service center.
0|5|I have used iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo in past. They used to freeze very often, especially Note 3 neo after the new update. Then I thought of buying a new phone under 15k. I really hated Xiaomi at first when they launched Mi3, but then I bought this phone. This phone is REALLY superb. Pros: Fast, never lags or freezes Camera quality is better than samsung's and Sony's Smartphones. Price is totally fair HDR system is really good Cons: Doesn't have a memory card slot. Doesn't come with handsfree, so you'll need to buy handsfree seperately. Although the Phone is really, really good. Xioami Rocks!! :D
0|5|Nice Camera specially front camera is amazing. Look wise i found it the best phone in this range. Till now no heating issues may be because i haven't used much. Very light weight phone.
0|3|i got my product ,but i m not satisfied with this ... sound is so boring .... also video quality is low... backup is also not so good... so, i sold this to other people @price 9000..
0|3|slow on games, continuous work high heat produce, no manual on the box its very very difficult to first on use.
0|5|Mi4i from Xiaomi is an awesome device which runs on Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 Octa Core Processor -having Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 chipsets. It has Android version 5.0.2 LRX22G, MIUI 6.0 (upgradable to 6.5.6.0(LXIMICD),2 gb RAM and 16 GB internal storage(10.5 GB approx. available),16M Colours,Full HD 5 inch IPS Display,Corning Scratch resistant glass,really nice 13 MP Rear camera and 5 MP Front Camera for Selfies & Video Calling.It has a nice but non removable Li-ion 3120 mAh battery which works for a whole day for a regular user,but half a day for a Gamer.Battery can work in two different modes viz-Balanced(Regular) & Performance(Gaming) Modes. Now the only cons are - 1. Non Expandable Memory. 2. Heats up very quickly. 3. Earphones not available in the package. You will also not get the screen guard in the package but don't worry you can avail it as a freebie from the mi official website(will take a 1-2 weeks to deliver without any tracking information). I hope you will be helped from this review,and please add more information about this product for the users. Thank You
0|3|Pros : 1. Good camera 2. Stylish design 3. Weight less 4. Good UI & 5. Best support atleast for MIUI (I mean frequent updates are coming for MIUI) Cons : 1. Heating issue is still there even after update. (Hope it will be rectified it in coming updates) 2. even though the RAM is 2GB, you will never get not even 1GB. All the time available RAM is only less than 800MB. MIUI is eating it all. (Hope it will also rectified it in coming updates)
0|4|This is an amazing phone, I love it. I am using this from past one week and no issues so far, only problem I am facing is with FM radio, it is not working. My only concern while buying this product was less memory space of 16GB (Only 12 gb user space is available) and heating issue. But I tell you with the OTG support space is not an issue at all and yes it gets heated when you are playing heavy games or phone is charging but that's a minimal heating not a major concern for me. Final words, if you are looking for a good performance packed phone under 15K-20K this could be the one that too only in 13K.
0|3|is not a good product....than mi3 ..aur iska memory v bahut kam he..only 10.68 gb....so dont buy this phone
1|4|Comfortable handling, Camera average (not bad), Good looking, out speaker volume is low Heating problem while working internet Overall it's good for this budget
0|4|i am really love with this phone it seems very cute looking and performs well most attracting factor of the mi4i is the screen quality and the picture quality, it is simply awesome pros camera screen quality nice loooking sound quality battery back up pros bt icant tell u that this phone is not the best fluent one, iwas using the zenfone5 before buying this and it was more fluent than mi4i and you should aware of this also ,that mi4i has a corning glass bt it is not a perfect one because in my phone after a few weeks use it got scratch on it's top and you should remember this is not a scratch proof one bt by over all perfomance you can buy it ,it will be worth for your money
0|4|The Product Is excellent following are the pros and cons 1. Good color white seems upmarket 2. Fast 3. Camera is excellent 4. Display is crisp 5. excellent buy at this price point. CONs 1. gets heated up below the screen and it feels hot while talking the whole display from centre seems hot while talking 2. Night shots in camera are not of very good quality 3. inbuilt battery 4. no memory card and hence no memory upgrade. i am also using the yu both are good phones. i request Mi4i to look into the heating issue
0|5|Nice phone, slim and sleek. Good battery back up. Works well... no issues till date. Must buy. .......................
0|4|This is nice phone. Good to feel in hands. But build quality is something you'll definately disaapoint over. Phone is quite slower than MI3 ( pretty much ) vibration gives you feel of really low quality other than that Design: 4 star Display: 4.5 star Camera: 5 star Build Quality: 2.5 Star Performance: 3 Star this is an Okay purchase anyhow. I have Mi4 / Mi3 / Mi4i Phones I can spot the difference
0|4|Pros - Good build quality nice touch Seamless performance Amazing Battery backup that lasts 36 Hrs with 3G (I am a lite user.) Cons - It feels a bit heavy in hands Not so slim like S5 but still good in this price range.
0|5|Mi 4i is fantastic one, i have been using it since a month, no heating issue, no hung ups, no non-sense at all. 1. My daily usage includes, around 60 min of calls, 90 min of music/entertainment, around 120 min of watspp approximately (but 24*7 available online), 30 min of games, i am getting around 1.5 days on full charge. 2. Display is superb. 3. I am not much into GPU as i play very little. 4. Music is awesome even with Rs350/- samsung ear phones, so don't spend too much in that area, by default Mi is not providing ear phones. 5. Call quality is good. 6. Intenal memory is 16gb, which quite enough for any one who is having a laptop/desktop, as you can shuffle info now and then. Trust me, one who stocks up more than 10gb at any time, they will have more obsolete/unnecessary data. 7. Front and rear cameras are decent enough, more light more fun! 8. Ringtone volume is too low which gets quite problematic many times. And the worse part is using alarm with low volume ringtone. Solution: Search for high volume song and keep it as ringer! 9. Personal opinion: Please folks, stick to 4.7 inch screen mobiles, as phone should be like a phone, not phablet!
0|3|CONS: 1.) Everybody is familiar with the well known heating issue of this phone, even after updating its version to MIUI 6.5.6.0 phones gets heats up around speaker, which makes impossible to talk on phone. 2.) Sometimes missed calls are considered as rejected calls and that is why no missed call notification is shown.
0|3|Reviewing after couple of months use. a) At times rings of the calls is not heard hence they are missed b) Missed calls are indicated as Rejected and the calls canceled by user are also indicated as Rejected so its difficult to make out missed calls. The call center guy asked to clear cache each time it happens which is a pain c) The dialer screen & SMS screen wont exit till they are killed from background. This too happens rarely but it does happen. d) You need to have external file manager like ES or any other if you wish to have notification tones of your choice from the phone memory else it wont let you do so. e) Email support is poor. Nobody bothers to answer. Good things ------------------ Fast, very good cam, good MIUI with some really good features, good battery life, light weight.
0|5|I am using this product since last 1 week. I had heard a lot about the heating problem of xiomi sets and this phone heats up like a bomb. I am a moderate user of the phone having all basic applications which are essential for your daily life. I am not fond of gaming as such so cant say if it heats while playing games. But while doing surfing (Wi-Fi mode on) and playing music, traversing all the apps for usage,i couldnt find temperature rising. Good deal and go for it. Yeah, you should update your phone first!!
1|5|A good mobile in this price, excellent camera, best screen resolution and good battery backup. If include headphones in xiaomi packs customer would get 100 percent satisfy
0|5|Good display,good Battery ,Good camera.No lag or struck.Game running Smooth.No heat issue, No 3g only Option in miui.Take time to charge.Speaker Volume is low
0|5|after purchase you just get an update from Mi install in and rock Pros: 1.battery life 2.gaming performence 3.camera 4.smooth ui 5.extra some more themes to coustmize your device inbuilt hardware testing service and bug reporter cons: 1.gets heated while in pure gaming(doesn't effects battery) didnt find any other features: camera quality is awesome with some special features 2Gb ram for better gaming and multi tasking
0|4|the phone is awesome.. performance up to the mark.. camera incredible. both front and back. the only disadvantage is it heats up.. and sometimes due to overheating the charger doesn't work. phone is very slim flipkart services are asusual very good. delivered in 2 working days.
1|5|GOOD, DISPLAY, TOUCH, SOUND, WIFI ,3G, 4G CONNECTIVITY, BOTH CAMERA FRONT & REAR. IN THIS PRICE RANGE .
0|4|I received this product on 24th May 2015, which dwelled very soft & light in my hands. Good in processing with Octacore 1.7GHz processor Best Front camera ever with 5MP & good clarity One hand usage 13MP rear camera is awesome User memory is 13.7GB is very much sufficient After Software update, No heating issues I had an idea of buying Apple 4S, But after using Mi4i. No other choice even it is Apple bcoz features of Apple @ Low cost & User friendly.
0|4|Absolute engineering marvel Has set the bar really high You will not repend 5 stars if it had capability to include memory card
1|1|mi4i ek bekaar mobile hai koi bhi na kharidey jo chhattishgarh me rahta hai front cam 20 din me khraab ho gaya . speaker se ring tone sunai nahi deta . phone garam hota hai. service center nagpur me hai. kya mai mi4i repair karwaney ke liyey hotel mr rahu aur 6 ghantey ka safar karu.
0|4|looks good..white variant of mi4i looks better than the grey one... day to day life performance is excellent.....display is best what u can get in this price segment..texts are clearly visible in direct sunlight..one thing that i dont like about this phn is the limited storage...out of 16gigs u will get 10.7gb available and is not expandable throurgh sd card....mi should provide 32 or 64 gb variant of mi4i..however usb otg is suppoted by which u can access pendrives through ur phn....
0|5|Just bought it last week, and super happy with it. First the initial glitches - indeed there was an awful heating problem out of the box. There was significant heating even after installing the update, but after 3-4 hours of usage, the heating problem completely went away. For the first 3-4 hours, there was also a bit of a lag in the UI, probably because the phone was syncing my emails and photos from Google. But from the second day onwards, everything has been awesome. Now the awesome bits - the display is outstanding. It completely blows away the display in OnePlus One,. MiUi has a few quirks, but is overall a delight to use. The UI is really responsive. The phone is really solidly built too. The camera is very good. Pictures in good lighting are outstanding. Those in dim lighting are way better than my last phone Moto G 2nd edition. Google now cards setup is a bit quirky (you have to get the google now launcher), but once set up it works great. The phone works great with my Moto 360 too. Overall, its impossible to beat this phone at this price. I think it can beat any phone under Rs. 20k. Don't worry about the heating issues and buy it now!
0|5|great value for money mobile.....xiaomi mi4i....@ 13000..... great camera...good processor....good memory....very slim...easy to handle....easy to use......good battery life.....
0|2|fist bad impression is cell heating up otherwise battery is good camera is ossam using more than 1gb ram after update. cell is fast
0|1|While using this mobile the back panel & screen of the handset is heat up drastically...........................................................................................
0|5|Review after 2 months of full usage Firstly after switching on the 4ne got the update of miui version blah blah something which is of size 800mb... downloaded and used the 4ne for 1 week... yes the 4ne is heating up badly on HEAVY usage... frustated and havent used it for 1 day after a day got d other update of size 40mb and again downloaded it.........From here my 4ne started working like a gem.... never expected it,,,,, the heating problem reduced maximum and started giving good results while "GAMING" too... After few days received the another update of 20mb size,,,,, now the camera clarity too increased much better no no best in this range.....never less than a mini size DSLR....... afterall with my experience faced just one word Simply GO FOR IT.......
0|4|The first look of the phone is great. I love it. Camera quality is awesome. It is much better compare to other android and Microsoft 640 XL. It has little bit heating problem during gaming only.
0|5|I'm writing this review after i used phone for a week the phone is simply amazing n works smoothly there is no issue in phone.The camera is simply awesome n sound quality is unimaginably nice.Plz update the phone to latest version ie 6.5.6 stable then there will be no issues.HATS OFF TO XIAOMI WHO HAVE MADE THIS PHONE.SIMPLY AWESOME.!!!
0|5|1 ) it has really long life battery??? 2) handset are not come in the box?? 3) really it is great phone???
0|4|Hi! Phone's excellent. - I've been facing heating issues always around the earpiece at front top till 1/4th of the phone's length, all updates are installed. Any solution for this? Please write back. Most users seem to face the same heating issue. Same heating problem is mentioned in GSM Arena review as well.
0|1|Dont even think to buy this phone. With very little usage as well, the phone temp goes beyond 40. I understand that most of the smart phone gets heated up but this is beyond imagination. Worst part is, it emits heat from the speaker side and not from back which means you cant touch it to your ears if you have to speak longer on the phone. With latest update as well, issue remains unresolved. If heating was not an issue (Which is a serious concern to handle) then phone is good. Camera quality is outstanding but if you start playing heavy games, it will lag a bit. Strongly discouraged to pick this up.
0|3|The product details said that the battery is 3120 mh but the battery hardly last long for a day. It should last long for at least for three days. Many previous phones with less mh factor lasted for at least two and half days. I think some thing wrong with the battery or the company placed a low quality battery in the phone. Otherwise, working smoothly but overheats many times. There are some technical problems which I could not understand. I have compared with my son's mobile phone Moto G (2nd Generation) but there is a difference between these two phones though I could not differentiate technically. Moreover, one cannot come to a conclusion so early on Mi 4i. I am very much disappointed they have released Gray colour mobile later. I was forced to buy white colour phone as I purchased on initial sales. Being a non-technical man, I say the phone is good as I have not encountered any major problem so far.
0|4|I am Mi very good have with MI4I its awesome UI and wonderful camera .. overall its good deal.. only cons is lil heating .. and ......lil lacking only.
0|3|Had the phone delivered in 3 days..great service by flipkart..they delivered a day ahead of the committed date. However, I did receive a defective phone. The camera was giving very grainy pictures, the battery wasn't charing to a full 100%, the touch was slightly slow in response and the all talked about heating issue was there. Having said that, I raised a replacement request which was promptly attended within 24hrs and was duly confirmed a replacement after they made their routine checks. About the phone: Pros: 1. amazing display 2. a refreshing change for the stock android users but still want to stick to it 3. value for money, looks classy 4. the grey version is actually better looking than the white one cons: 1. slightly slippery 2. you only get 10GB of actual storage
0|3|--- Good --- Flipkart delivered the phone as the promised, packing is good mobile also looks good. Light weight ---- Bad --- Camera lens coming with two different lens, one is from samsung, another form Sony, people who get from Sony they are lucky. Out of 2 GB ram the free memory could be only 400 MB, if you uninstall the default software then the memory could go 200 more I don't have any issue with camera , but my friend had some issues with front camera.. After 5sec the front camera will not work ( you find many dots) NOTE: If you are unhappy with your product or if its not working as expected flipkart never return your money... They force you to get another mobile on same brand. Its all your luck !! All the best !!
0|3|Screen is Excellent. Sound is not that much good.need improvement on Sound quality. Heating issue is there.
0|5|Prompt delivery by flipkart. And very good phone indeed. Very light weighted. Screen is crystel clear and great viewing angle. Call clarity is very ggod. Dual sim with both supporting LTE is very important to me since reliance jio is planning to offer LET support across india in competative price (but call support might not be that good, hence need to have other sims for call support). Batery back-up easily for 1 day with average usage. MIUI is what i liked the most. Heats up to an extent while playing games. Else everything fine for now.
1|1|I have bought this phone 10 days ago and the only problem is that it heats up while navigation on maps, calling and using internet. Mi claims that they have given update which reduces the heating but i have done that as well with no avail. I sent an email, to which they responded immediately, and suggested some ways to check temperature and some process to remove cache but that too doesnt help. the temperature can range between 27-47 degrees. I have written to them again but no reply yet. I am sure they will come up with some replacement policy to take care of this issue. They should if they need to sell for long-term. Otherwise, the phone is a GEM. very light weight, good battery, excellent camera, nice resolution (all as per specs). Internal memory can be a issue for those who dont delete their data often and use FB and Whatsapp heavily.
1|4|+As light as paper. +Decently fast processing. +Decent Audio quality. -Below average loud speaker volume. +Decent Camera. +4G soars.
0|5|I brought the MI4I in the first sale from Flipkart. I got my phone within 48 hours after placing the order. Now been almost 2 months using this handset, experience was wonderful and i am very impressed with the phone. Beautiful Look, Slim Design, Excellent Performance, Good Clarity and very importantly getting in reasonable price. However sometimes i feels heating issue while on phone, that should be addressed. I would recommend personally go for this phone guys.
0|5|It has best features available in the market now. working absolutely fine. just gets heatup while charging. apart from that no complaints. guys simply buy it. at this great price you wont get anything better than this. worth a penny.
1|2|In 2 weeks of purchase screen had a crack and the menu buttons were not responding. I don't believe it is a gorilla glass.Change the LCD screen cost Rs 4000. The service center don't have the stock of the LCD screen. I'm waiting for last 3 weeks. Still they say that they have not received the LCD screen stock, and phone is with the service center. Please do not buy the Mi products.
0|5|very good mobile, mindblowing performance, stunning featuresss My rating is more than 5 but memory is not sufficient it had just 12 gb it is not enough please upgrade. irrespective of memory cell is a good product
1|5|Well..as of all the people who bought mi4i,I was very well aware of its lack of memory(which can be covered using an OTG cable and an pendrive),heating effects(which can be reduce by an update of 800 mb) etc. But despite that I still stick to it. Its an good model in its price range..maybe the best. Good battery backup,excellent camera(both rear and front),nice gaming experience and good looks, mi4i is an amazing phone..just grab it!
1|4|As i have read all reviews most of people shared bad experience with mi 4i but i had taken decision to purchase mi 4i waiting for it when i receive handset i will update genuine review about mi 4i
0|5|Used this product for one month before it was stolen, excellent product with absolutely clear resolution and camera. also the application is very fast, has some amount of heat generation which is bearable. battery life is also pretty good lasting for one and half days with all applications like facebook, whatsap , gmail and official mail running. Gaming is also great for low and medium end game. Direct recording for a call and screen sensor in the sunlight are added feature. overall value for money. i have ordered again the same model with same colour- white.
0|1|1. The promised screen guard never reached. 2. Display started to get spots after 25 days, Flipkart said too late when I reported the issue to them on 32 day. Now under warranty repair and they are saying minimum 15 days to replace the Display. 3. UI - poor copy of Apple, you will get a Chinese popup when you connect to a computer! No idea how to fix that. Strictly avoidable.
1|5|1. slim 2. very light weight 3. Good screen quality 4. Single hand usage better than zenfone 2 5. Slight heating issues even in latest update but it wont be a problem 6. Sound is not good 7. Iphone 4s like menu access 8. expandable memory not present (only 10 GB available for user)
0|1|No Manual, No Headphone was provided by the company. very cheap....... It is good but some time it get hanged.
0|1|I bought Mi4i in the last week's sale. Flipkart was very quick in delivery (got it next day itself) instead of 4 days they mentioned when placing the order. Good job flipkart. Havent played around much on this phone, but all my attempts to sync with google contacts has failed. Tried various things in the phone, looked up multiple posts on the web, but looks like the MIUI has blocked access to google contact. I have seen similar posts on the MIUI forum as well. 2nd problem is that there is no user manual available as of now. Too bad MI. So, prospective buyer's, beware of these problems.
0|5|Awesome packing and before time deliver Camera quality grt.... Performance and speed ....fast Battery backup...all most 30 hrs Charging time is very less Appearance both of the hardware & software is superb.....
0|4|I ordered this phone after a decent research with cost vs performance. I guess it meets my expectations and more. # The phone's performance in apps as well as otherwise is great. # Battery lasts about 20 hours with data ON continuously. It is longer if data used judiciously # The camera is AWESOME # Looks, features etc. are all best in class # Am extremely happy with the buy
0|2|in this phone you get a good front camera n display ... n thats it. hangs a lot, music player is not working. call connect to other persons [ when i dial to one person it connect to last dial no]. games hangs a lot.
0|5|Good product by xiomi, nice one and value for money, battery life is superb getting whole day performance. only one drawback, does not have expandable memory, only have 16gb inbuilt.
0|5|This phone has high specifications but the price reasonable price ! Fast working processor and robust build ! I am proud to possess and feel happy to use !
1|4|I have been using this phone for the past ten days. It is a good phone with all the facilities available. Good battery life, very good display, good interface. But there are a few negatives that you should keep in mind before buying this phone: 1) It heats up quite occasionally. That too around the earpiece creating difficulties. 2) The memory is not expandable. Out of 16 gb you only get around 10 gb to use. 3) At any particular instance, RAM available is only 700MB(max.) out of 2GB. 4) The volume of phone is a little low to hear. Sound is not even decent. 5) Bit difficult to manage files on this phone.
0|3|Mi 4i an ultimate beauty of a device in this price range. Vivid display, iOS look alike UI, new features which is not even you can see in other big guns like Samsung or HTC. Rear camera takes excellent pictures in the daylight and low light pictures are just okay. Have seen users complaining about the heating issue, but I didn't see anything so far on a regular issue. I haven't tried any games and that may be the reason I didn't see any heating issues. But for a normal use, it worked like a charm. Now, there are three major cons with this device. 1. SOUND: Its very low compared to the other Mi devices. Not sure whether its something to do with the software and can be fixed later with an update. But for now you guys can miss many calls when its kept on a flat surface. 2. BUGGY MIUI: There was a major 800MB update for the phone to fix heating issues and apart from that I'm not sure what changes were made. But overall the MIUI still looks like a work in progress and bugs all over it. For Ex: When you make a call the proximity sensor fails to work and the screen won't turn off when you take it near to your ears. And again when you hang up the screen won't turn on to end the call. You may need to press the power button to wake up. And... when you make a outgoing call the contact picture won't display, but when you receive a call from the same contact the picture is displayed. VERY CONFUSING. Like I said there are these minor bugs and all this can be fixed by an update. I guess they are working on it. 3. NOTIFICATIONS: Now this is a major concern for any normal smartphone. There is always a big delay from the app notifications like Whatsapp, Messenger or any other chat app. This is a intermittent problem and it won't push the notification as normal. Its like the phones decision whether to work or not. Sometimes it push this notification very fast and sometimes not. I used to wonder why there are no message from my friends and once I open the app it delivers all messages in one shot. Just weird!! So if the above cons are fixed in the near future, this will be the phone everyone need to carry. As of now its still a good phone if you can ignore this cons. Go for it!!
0|4|The Mi4i is a great product from the Xiaomi...I have got the grey version and I am really in love with this phone...the design, the build quality all are pretty awesome. Specially, the sunlight display...it is really nice feature. Its pretty useful. Normally, in daylight other phones are kind of illegible to read the text or identify the symbols etc., but with the sunlight display feature in Mi4i, it really resolves that problem. Its brightness is enhanced in the daylight. The 3120 mAh battery is working really nice...a fully charged battery runs the whole day and I continuously use 3G data..daily. So that makes it a tough player. The only con I will say is the fixed memory of 16 GB (user available 12.77 GB) but since I don't use lots of apps and games...its not a big issue for me. The performance, response, the touch...all are pretty awesome. I love this phone...a must buy at this price range.
0|5|Mi 4i is really good Handset, camera is good, Battery backup is good, exclent display, overall best products
0|3|phone unknowingly hangs out in between the work although there is no such heavy work i m doing which effect the processor or the mui operating system... battery drains out very fast without ny playing heavy duty games it heats up very high... on doing a simple work service center issue...
0|4|Camera nice, some UI features are not so cool and easy.. Sim selection while calling is quite panic... Still like it's performance...
0|5|The phone is amazing !! I wont go in to massive details and technical aspects as i find that there are already a lot of reviews delving deep in to the tech features of this mesmerizing product. Me being a normal Indian buyer will always look for certain features to satisfy my needs and demands from a phone costing 13k.(which coincidentally matches with 80% of the buyers these days ;) ) 1. Display/Look and Feel- Phone weighs 130 g (absolute beauty), 1920 x 1080 Full HD display(will surely envy a lot of people around you), the 480 ppi density will keep you glued to your phone, sleek and classy design, and a matte finish. - Deal 2.Processor- The octa core works magic for this smartphone as i did not find any notable lags in multi-tasking with moderate gaming and moderate internet usage at the same time. Multi tasking is butter on stove for this phone(Im not exaggerating) ! - Deal 3.OS (Android L with MIUI)- The Lollipop is fab ! Almost all of the Lollipop features are perfectly executing and i personally belive that MIUI on top of it gives an additional edge this phone. MIUI works wonders with its creative and eye-catching UI and customizability. Once you're used to it, you love the thing ! - Deal 4. Camera - I certainely dont understand how did some people find the camera on the phone average. Imo, the camera is fantastic once you know how to use it. There are several features in the inbuilt camera app that can, at times give you SLR level images. The rear camera clicks cool images and the dual tone flash gives a natural look to the images. Manual mode is another exciting feature. However, you need to work a bit harder in order to get good images in dark. The front camera is prety decent too, better than most of the phones in this price range. Clicks clear and cool selfies. I dont see why this aint good(acc. to some users) ! - Deal (Go for some video reviews on how to get proper images in mi4i on you tube.) 5. Storage- 11BG is what you get initially and after the first update it will come down to around 10.8GB. But with OTG compatibility, its fine for me.(some people have issues here i know.) - not a Deal? 6. Battery and Heating : Firstly, the battery is very good. its not exactly 3120 mAh(3030mAh actually) but easily lasts one full day with moderate use. A few hour of gaming and normal internet use which is hard to find these days in a
0|4|Got this phone yesterday... overall it is a nice phone for people whose budget is under 15K... Pros:- 1.Good screen quality 2.Sound is good 3.camera is pretty good for day photo shoot( not for low light photos) Cons: 1. Even after the update it is heating up but less than before the update. 2. Trouble having connecting Wi Fi(event though reception is excellent) 3.Internal memory after update is only 10.37 GB
0|3|1. Camera is good 2. Skype and Lync apps I will use regularly and those works faster than other mobiles 3. Good performance and look and feel 4. Touch is very soft Problems : 1. Some times call cannot be cancelled; It hangs for some time 2. Continues hit camera will hang for some time 3. Displayed black/blank screen one time; Dont know the reason 4. Speaker volume is very less 5. If we speak little away from mike others cannot listen
0|5|Received on time. Known facts are available on google about the specification but meets my expectation.Value for money.
0|5|No word describe the richness of features but sometime start hanging while typing with google keyboard or swift keyboard . else every thing is awesome specially camera
0|5|extraordinary phone with high end features. when I saw reviews of this product, somebody mentioned about the heating issue.May be they are using with Performance mode, But if you are using balance mode no heating problem will come. I am very happy about this product. Except one thing that is price. After I bought this they reducing the price. Any way that is good for people who looking to buy this product.
0|5|nice product slim and powerful.. yes 2gb with 13mp camera. its camera result is excellent. nice product
0|3|I AM GREAT FAN OF MI Pros: Display is Nice and crisp. Sound quality is good but not loud. Battery backup good. Cons: Heats up even after update.... Camera is good but not good as even redmi 1s Google apps installs slowly. After update of 800 MB, only 9.7 GB available...
0|5|I got this phone about a month back and have been using extensively throughout. 4G and 3G are on always all the time as well as Wifi, infact I have a US sim and an Indian sim paired together on this. I have about no qualms getting this phone. Battery is pretty good, I have to charge it about 30-60 minutes every day to make it to next day. I run Outlook, Whatsapp, Ringo, Facebook, IM, Google Mail, Yahoo and most of the apps are syncing all the time. Plus constant calls. So very heavy use of internet all day and it does not drain the battery that much. Read so many reviews about this phone getting hot and it is true. The phone ships with base software and it gets hots. But as soon as I got this phone, I updated it to next system upgrade and this issue is gone. It still gets warm as with every other phone out there but not super hot anymore. The settings on this phone may frustrate users who are new to android. I had to set so many settings to get international roaming to work properly and send text messages. Same with Internet usage. Please ask for help with someone who knows this phone system to set the settings. But in the flip, the settings are very useful as you can set permissions on app level. Performance is super slick. No lags that I have noticed to be frustrating. I own a lot of samsung phones and this plays on par with all of them for much cheaper price. I would say that for a price tag of 12000 this is an awesome deal to get.
0|5|My first Mi purchase and it has stayed true to its specs .. magnificent display, very light weight and super smooth to operate .. totally worth the price, switched to this phone after using iPhone for last 3 years and I am not looking back again. p.s if you are looking for anything that is not good about this phone then it's definitely the "missing memory card slot" and the phone heats up a bit during long hour calls and app (games) usage ..
0|1|Wish I hadn't revised my ratings so soon.. My newly purchased Xaomi Mi 4i is facing speaker issues now.. Its speaker has stopped functioning.. have to take it to service center for a possible software issue.. I am deeply dissatisfied with the product ! X( Comments Edited: After Xaomi guys called me up and helped me out with the settings and also, I received a mail from the Airtel CEO owning up to the increase in call drops as an airtel failure, I believe I am satisfied with the phone now. Worthwhile buy at such comparable price. Thanks team for taking up the issue with such promptness ! :) PS: In case you guys are noticing, kindly add a feature in the music tab, to sort the songs through albums or singers.. currently it's a mess out there ! Good to have feature ! Earlier Comments: This one although has a fabulous front camera for selfie lovers and a smooth interface, what put me off this phone within three weeks of buying it is the incessant network issues.. once the network is lost, I have to manually reboot the phone to get the network back and even the internet connectivity has not been up to the mark.. first one week this phone was a breeze but after that it has been nothing but a major pain.. I regret having spent 13K in a Chinese phone !! :\ And I owned an S3 before this.. I wish I had rather spent money on a well known brand as there is a reason they are called a Brand ! PS: Others might or might not be facing this issue.. This was purely a personal experience !
1|2|If possible I would suggest increase your budget and go for One plus One. The extra 3-4 grand's would be worth paying for.Mi4i has lot of operational issues and gets heated very fast. Xiomi has seemed to lost it by selling Mi4 for 15 grands and launching Mi4i for 14 grand. I don't see the point here 3 months from launch of Mi4i the company slashes the prices for Mi4.
1|4|First to start with i returned this product twice because of camera issue.Even though i was disappointed with the product , flipkart's customer service impressed me. They took the product back and delivered new product.This will not be possible if you buy a product from a shop or branded showroom.Flipkart you people are redefining buying experience. Regarding the product. Camera .This should be the prime reason to by this product. Both camera provide decent picture. Display. It deliver sharp display.You will not go back to your laptop for movies. Sound. This is the area were you will get disappointed. Build Quality: Its too soft and handy.
0|5|Awesome phone...overall... I never used like it phone in my life... picture quality is sooooo good...
0|4|Heating problem is there which can be resolved by upgrading the OS. Overall good. I had already been using MI3 thus gifted this model to my sister.
0|5|This phone is awesome, it is very beautiful,stylish and good looking, battery is very durable,front camera is excellent and rear camera is also very excellent, phone have 16 GB memory is sufficient for me, totally phone performance is very excellent, thanks for Flipkart.
0|5|super slick, premium feel, super sensitive touch panel, no heating issues, absolute bargain!!! only thing missing is the headphones... nonetheless very very good worth for your money!!! really happy with the product.
1|4|At this price Range, a must buy phone for executive peoples. Its camera working fine in proper lighting, however its results are below expectations in less lighting environment. Overall having Good Experience in Using this Phone. (Using this Phone Since last 1 Month).
1|4|Phone excellent Display, Camera is also good. Background application need to be in control. It consumes lot of battery. Battery is okay Little disappointing. No Headphone is disappointing
1|4|processor works better, bit lag in operation due to miui interface. camera performance is good in daylight, but facing problem at night though it has dual flash.
0|3|I have purchased this phone a few days back, but what i found is that it is good in function so far, but as boasted in its qualities. the screen is not rough and tough as like samsung phones. it has a gorilla glass as the specifications says that is scratch proof. but exactl opposite, i have got scratches in a very normal use and also a scar which i never faced on my Samsung Galaxy S3 since 3 years. it feels like a toy in hand when compared to other good smart phones with similar features. :) Its more of a feminine phone...! I am happy but not fully satisfied, would be giving it to my girl friend who liked it like hell...! :P
0|4|A very well built phone which premium features. First impression is really good. Hopefully will have same experience to tell post some time.
0|4|Superior phone at this price. Battery performance is very impressive although i am using both SIM slots. About camera i am little disappointed becz this is not much fine as we expect from it. There is no heating issue and speaker issue in the phone. And if talk about it look that is very stunning and adorable , you can easily grip it. 2 GB RAM and 3120mAh battery giving us more reason that why should we buy this phone.
0|4|Hi All, Bought this phone on friday and the phone arrived on saturday . Thanks flipkart for this. Phone is better than many other phones . PROS: Good display -5 stars Day light display or sunlight display is good - 5 star Octa core and switching apps is easy- 4 star Amazing customisable notification - 4 star on this CONS no ultra power saver .1 star for this missing feature heats like iron box when using it for calls which are long duration - 30 mins or more- 2 star for this Phone heats too much initially UNTIL the update of 800 Mb is completed.- 2 star for this. Camera is amazing but since the phone is smoothened in corners the camera can be felt on touch . Doubtful whether if it can last the wear and tear due to keeping in pocket and pushing . 3 Stars for being doubtful.
0|4|I ordered the phone on 11.06.15 and got it on 13.06.15.fastest delivery. Phone is good.slight heating issue is there,but after 800mb update heating issues was solved. Overall very nice phone to use.
0|3|Just finished 30 days of using the phone and it has started to act up - not detecting the sim card, most callers complain of gibberish when they call my phone now. I am also noticing a slight lag on apps opening. I am going to try a phone reset, if that doesnt work need to go back to my Asus Zenfone which still works great after a year. Flipkart advise on next steps here.
0|4|I ordered a MI4I phone and got it on time. There service is very good. I would prefer flipkart for online purchase
0|5|Gem at this price, its very good phone to use. really made to perform, good display, camera, look , size and weight. and very good battery backup. super hardware. i can't ask for more at this price. its performs as best phone in the market.
0|5|I m not going into specs sheet. I have used all mobiles including iPhone. Take home points are Build quality : Very good Screen : Excellent User interface : Very nice and smooth except for few glitches Battery : Average (coz of full HD screen) External speaker : Low (only downside I found) ** I DID NOT HAVE ANY HEATING ISSUES. BEEN USING THE MOBILE IN BALANCED MODE
0|4|The type of phone you want to get, really depends on the use you want to put it to - If you are looking for a good phone - to use for calls, msgs, social media, browsing, audio/video playback -in this price bracket, this phone performs really well Pros Nice UI - MI UI6 Beautiful screen Super Camera Good Battery Super light - great looking No problems so far Cons to consider Games do not run very smoothly on this, but playable Memory not expandable (Also consider the Asus Zenfone 2 in the same price bracket) Good job MI
0|5|I have been using iPhone 4, 4S, 5S.. but due to file transfer restriction and battery issues I planned to switch to Android.. This is my first android device... I have see and get use to lot of android devices. but this one is quite different.. After unpacking the package.. i have no doubt that.. i am holding a premium phone. I just got use to the phone in couple of hour usage.. after some time i discovered how beautiful MIUI 6 is.. it got best in class themes and its updated frequently.. lot of system updates (everything makes the phone more elegant in using). If your planning to buy a premium android device.. I suggest please have this in mind. After all the phone is just valued before its unpacked. Once used its just a depreciating value. SO please dont go for premium phones.. now I am a proud member of MIUI forum.. where users share their experience and its been valued by the XIAOMI team for development. Have a good day.. use your money wisely.. :)
1|4|xiaomi mi4i looks vry nyc in hand... battery life is litttle down... the main negative is its storage..
0|1|At first i gave good review and rating but i am sorry for the brothers and sisters who bought because of that Phone was running good for 1 Month and 2 days after my return policy expired it began to show its true face Around 11:40PM Charge was 100% and when i woke up at 6:30AM next day i found my phone dead and non responsive. I tried to charge my phone but it was not charging. I took the issue with both MI and Flipkart. The issue got solved After 3 Days First with battery and charger. Now Speaker I was talking with my friend with speakers on suddenly i heard noise was coming out of speaker and i thought call quality is bad and ended the call when the same person was calling, to my shock i realised that speaker was gone and i can only hear noise instead of ring tone I Do not recommend this product to anybody This the second incident I was using LUMIA 520 for 2Years which did not have any issue even till Now. So please buy some other phone which is good.
0|4|Product arrived on time great camera and touch gave to mom as gift so cant really give any detailed description
0|3|The constuction of the phone is premium, looks very good and runs individual apps brilliantly - but the phone suffers from stuttering and lag across - I think due to very heavy UI - although the RAM, at 2gb, should be enough - one ends up being fixated to end back ground apps, switching off hardware elements to free up RAM - very difficult to multitask
0|4|Its nice phone, Works good with 1.5 to 2 days battery life for normal use, Phone tends to get hot for long use. Overall good phone with value for money.
0|5|I was having Mi3 and I was very much impressed with Mi3 performance, display and sound & bought Mi4i because of that & using it from last two months and my findings are as under: Pro's: Good look, 4G , Slim design & dual Sim. Con's: Poor sound quality Display/brightness is not that great as mi3. Non availability of colors of choice for both phone as well as flip cover.
0|3|No matter how much they put RAM in their mobiles but they dont have effective RAM management. Still galaxy S2 runs fluid smooth when compares to Mi 4i. Also you get internal memory of around 11 Gigs, which is not sufficient in todays world. Do Invest a little more money in some good mobile to get peace of mind But this phone looks sexy no doubt !!
0|4|I got this product for my wife and she has been using it for more than a month now. The performance of the product is simply amazing, display is crystal clear, superfast processing, nifty features through MIUI. The only drawback is the overheating on the phone. Hence, heavy talktime users need to avoid this phone as it becomes quite hot after sometime (20 mins of talking) and with GPRS usage. This overheating might conk off either the motherboard or the battery (both of which are not changeable!). Overall 4 stars, deducing 1 star due to heating issues.
1|5|MI4I is a real smart phone Its working in all fields is quite quite Ok Never stops ,never becomes hot ,opens in seconds downloadind,music audio/video ,camera ,calling everything is perfect Its price is highly justified Only lack is memory is unexpendable above 16GB
0|4|Mi4i feels holding pretty good, no fingerprints on the back Full HD JDI display with corning OGS Glass, camera superb with low and bright & updates are quick... Call Quality is awesome... Performance is pretty cool... Gaming Perfomance is awesome... Appearance both of the hardware & software is superb, can use the Mi4i in one hand, dont waste it on something else.... n Finally Mi4i VFM..
0|5|i am very happy to purchase this phone it's camera & display quality is amazing, but it have lack of one thing that its zoom level is less than another phones
0|5|Best in class..superb built quality and awesome gaming experience.. smooth update. best of all its slick super compact and amazingly lite and sturdy.
1|5|Phone is Performing amazingly despite of some negative reviews on the internet gone for it not at all disappointed. Blazing fast Shipping and delivery.
0|4|Here is my review after 2 full day heavy usage of MI4i - Grey 1) Display - Will give you an excellent feel which make you to fall in love with this beast 2) Camera - Up the race definitely the Best camera (Rear & Front ) than any other mobiles available within 20k. 3) Battery - Being an heavy texter it lasted for around 12 hrs ( 3G HDR camera Gaming for 30 mins ) 4) Heat issue - Yes device gets heated up but its pretty normal in any of the smart phone available nowadays ( Heat issue is some what reduced after software update) Verdict - If you are not heavy gamer and if you not gonna worry about the warm issue if you are looking for an extraordinary camera device then blindly this is the right choice "TOTAL VALUE FOR MONEY"
1|5|After buying a couple of Xolo handsets since I am a Liverpool loyalist,I decide it's time to upgrade and go for a 10 grand upgrade. After patiently waiting throughout the summer for Zenfone 2 I got to know of its competitor Mi4i. My joy knew no bounds since I was begging for a kick'ass specifications handset which would come with a 5 inch screen. The look,feel is so satisfying when I received the phone I knew I made the right choice. 5 inch is really comortable and the matte-finish back is the smoothest scene ever. Heating a little only while charging very negligent. But other than that there is no heating issue once updated. People who have complained about heating used it before the update. The battery is solid and with difficulty can give you 2 days of light-moderate usage which is one of the rarest categories in smartphones these days . The Camera is inch-perfect. Its back-camera focus mode is just too crisp with HDR. I havent come across such an amazing camera in a sub 15 grand category. Although my budget was 10 grand . I dont regret paying a single penny more for this as the phone is just tailor-made for students like me since Storage isn't a consderation and is there for the purpose as it has a huge battery and the phone is still slim. SD card gets complications on phones and makes it slower. Really satisfied with the product ! :) Camera: 9/10 Display 9/10 Performance 8/10 Look and Feel 10/10 . Battery 8.5/10
0|4|phone is good, quality is good, camera is good.... not for music lovers...sound is not loud. Flipkart is good in delivery and after sale queries or complaints. Flipkart has chosen the right product. I hope Mi4i will last long and make good share in indian mobile market. Indian consumers are now quality oriented and price is the second factor for them. I wish all the best to Flipkart and Xioami Mi4i.
1|5|two complaints - not expandable memory only 16 gb second - audio output is too low.. stress is on TOO.. cant even hear call ringtone, had to download a high tempo ringtone ..
0|5|Its a good product ..100% price worth camera quality is great ,.. i love the feature that its camera also display age
0|5|Really long battery life. Morning 100%.by 6PM 50%. Very good quality camera. Seamless operations (I open multiple applications usually). Very good control over applications (through settings). Impressive display, video quality. Low weight, sleek, good looking. Value for money. Cons: No external SD card support, other phones separate into parts when fall down, this phone has no possibility of separating and I suspect it may get damaged on fall. Also the phone heats up more frequently than other phones I have used. Don't know: Not used 4G service in my city.
0|4|Powerful and slim best in class 13k. nice camera sharp screen . 5" screen fit in pocket. better Grip. better part is miui6 you can uninstall use less like google movie,etc awesome****
0|4|Pros: Good Display Decent Battery Pretty Decent Camera in Both Daylight & Indoor Lighting Cons: Speaker can be better.
0|5|So, i was using the samsungs, nokias, sonys until i hit XIOMI... First thing, how can the company sell it at half the price that other do? chinese can make things happen in MFG but may have to trade off with quality like Lavas, Intex......Well i was proven wrong with Mi4i!!! Proud owner to bring it in the first flash sale within 3mins..Took time to test my phone and now comes my review. Some notably points i observed would like to share: 1.Went in awe of the phone at first instance. 2. Specs of a 25k at 13k with uber build quality 3. Functioning is flawless 4. Had heating issues at the start, scared me- but went for an MIUI update that resolved it completely. Mild heating is accepted at any day 5. Have installed the heaviest loaded games on Android marker- NOVA 3, Dream League soccer, UFC, Clash of Clans and the phone functions smooth enough 6. 16gb is ok to have, would have loved 32gb but happy to avoid ext card slot as it may invite viruses 7. Camera is good enough. does the job well 8. Screen is big and clear 9. Sound is crisp 10. Just a bit annoyed with two things: a. A sping like sound and feel comes when i tap the phone head onto something. Maybe some loose fix internally. b. Color white. what diff does it make. I am certain, just a marketing gimmick to keep the demand going. 10. 9/10 for me... Hope you agree with me on this...thanks!!!
0|1|This set is troubling a lot with heating problem. Even if you update it then also you will face heating issue. After update issue is resolved a bit but at the cost of performance.
0|5|Just received the handset today. The grey color is perfectly blended on the body to give it a premium look. The phone looks very very premium and eye catching. Have'nt used it much except few apps. Runs like a butter! A must buy device. ! Worth every penny!
0|5|YEAH .. THATS IT THE BEST YOU CAN GET FOR THE MONEY . APART FROM OCCASIONAL HANG ISSUE WITH MIUI6 THE PHONE JUST ROCKS
1|4|google drive was not working on my new Mi4i, when purchased after reinstall google drive again it is working ok. but this kind of problems should not be there with a fresh piece.
0|3|I am having some ringtone problem... after some time ringtone gone silent automatically. checked all option it was right but no result.
0|1|phone has heating problem and softweare lags. Its got over heated when idle and while calling its getting heat. Very poor quality and sound quality is also very poor and not able to hear ringer.
0|4|I am using this phone for a month now. This phone is quite good but with few cons are there as well. 1=>) PRICE : Price of this phone is satisfactory and within this price it offers some good features too. ( SCORE 9/10 ) 2=>) DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY : phone size is good and feels good while holding in hand.Its not very big in size.Build quality is very nice . Back cover is of good quality and looks good too .Phone is also quite light too only 130 g . Volume rockers n power button are of good quality too .(SCORE IN DESIGN N BUILD : 9/10 ) 3=>)PERFORMANCE : Phone's performance is not top notch as I can feel lags here and there. Like when I m playing Subway Surfer its not at all top notch as I have to turn y phone to PERFORMANCE mode to play smoothly.Also in google now and other apps like office suite I didn't feel smooth performance.Multitasking is also not that good.Apart from that it is performing quite nicely(Maybe Later updates may fix some lagging). I also felt after rebooting phone works smoothly but after usage of 3-4 days it becomes slow in performance . RAM reduces to 450 / 500 MB . Don't know why... (SCORE IN PERFORMANCE : 7/10 ) 4=>) CAMERA : I am not a photo freak actually and didn't took lots of pics from it.But I can say that it produces fine pics with both rear n front cams. ( SCORE: 8/10) 5=>) DISPLAY : Display is excellent .(SCORE : 8.5/10 ) 6=>) BATTERY BACKUP AND CHARGING : Battery backup is good for whole day at 2G but at 3G lots of battery gets churned . Overall phone gives good battery backup.Also it gets fully charged within 2 hours so charging is fast .( SCORE : 8.5 /10 ) Following are some cons I found in my phone : 1=>) SOUND : In calling it is good.But ringing volume is too low.I didn't liked that at all. 2=>) MEMORY : Memory issue is there as only gives 12 GB usable memory and no memory card slot . 3=>)Not performing smoothly in some apps 4=>)Gets heated in performance mode but not that much... OVERALL this phone is a must buy at quite satisfying cost . Don't worry about heating issue ...its not that much trust me. Thanks and have a nice day :)
1|2|it is better to buy in winter so by playing game we keep warm...........phone not more then for 1 year like (likho pheko pen).........................................better to buy Indian brand so u can contribute in Make In India
0|1|A 4th class cell... never again i wann to see... I used 25 days than i felt that its good in only snap... otherwise its not usefull for daily...
0|4|A good product in this range. No network issues. Camera is decent enough Only problem is the sound is low. Better than Mi4. So just go for it
1|2|i was very eager about the mobile. it does not satisfy me. lot to be improved , iam facing lots of user interface problem, lagging, heating,charging and goes on. i bought because of its specs, but it is not up to. i will not recommend this product.i loved my previous phone (gionee e 7 mini ) which i have lost.....
0|3|Don't get voice calls while in 3g network.... Other things works well. no heating issue after update. Good Display and battery backup. Superb UI. Worth for money except network problem in 3g.
0|5|First, thanks to flipkart team for quick and ON time delivery. Replacement policy is also awesome. Review after 15 day's of usage: Device performance is good, it is smooth. High graphics games runs without any lags. Display screen and 13mp camera is awesome. After patch update sound is loud and clear. I found some issue to enable LTE & 3G on secondary sim and got replacement device. Overall good phone, will recommend for buyers
1|5|the camera, looks and everything is best about the phone. there is no heating issue after the update. bye it..
0|2|sensor not working ,screen should display when you take away from ear to cut the call but its not displaying the screen... big probelm to cut your call
0|3|flipkart and mi executives handle my problem and co-ordinate properly now i satisfied with after sale service
0|1|flipkart delivery was very good. as expected delivered in a day. About Product all the features are good. Except Over heating. It is getting heated up to 40 degrees when 3G enabled. If you watch On-line video over wi-fi Internet it goes up to 46 degrees. by mistake if you get call by that time(46degrees), you can't speak without headset.
1|1|Heating so high you may face problem in ear and not possible to talk more than 5 min. it may damage your health ,fell headache due to excess heating
0|3|Good device at a decent price. Brilliant screen and display. Outstanding camera. Coming to the performance, it's only been a week using this phone but my phone is getting hanged again and again. I had updated my phone on the day I received but still i am facing performance issues. If I use it continuously for an hour, it starts lagging and apps fail to run. Conclusion: Good device at this price, but looking at the processor and ram, lagging and hanging is not acceptable. So if you are looking for a device with a reliable high performance don't go for it. If u want for an average use, its a pretty nice device.
0|5|A Perfect Phone with all the stuff that I want. Performance, Battery and UI all together makes a cool product.
0|5|Reviewing after using for 1 months..Display & Camera is Awesome... Sound is average.. Light in Weight.. & Smooth in Operation
0|1|I purchased mi4i but the battery gets drained very quickly software problem. Apps open n close on it own all functions don't work properly .
0|4|The product is good and value for the money.............I am using from last 2 months i have not faced any issues with this phone just one or twice i faced slow response at the time of HD Recording or taking HD pictures.......
0|5|A Perfect Phone with all the stuff that I want. Performance, Battery and UI all together makes a cool product.
0|3|Very good Phone in this range.Camera Performance is good.Display is also good.but Miui user interface is not very friendly
0|5|Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing (here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing, its quite common , i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating, gets warm during browsing) i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera
0|3|I have bought this for my wife as she was successful in breaking her Moto G Gen 1 screen. this is more of a comparison with the Moto G rather than a straight forward review based om my wife's feedback. The phone is not as smooth and fast as the Moto G and lags/hangs/ becomes un responsive although it boasts of 2 GB RAM The camera is very nice and the photos are really impressive. The internet browsing speed is ok ok and not something to go ga ga about. My wife has been asked about this phone but no one really noticed the MOTO G, the MIUI us good but i think stock android is really fast and great as you can install based on your need. Overall this phone feels light and we have found that the edges of the glass get scratched (after one and half month of use) thats it
0|2|Lot of Bugs in the Software like calls getting rejected automatically and various other bugs. Battery lasts for the entire day which is good. Had battery heating issues which was fixed in the new MIUI update.
1|5|Pro - configuration, display, battery & more & more. Con - No earphone in the box, poor speaker sound.
0|5|Phone is good COns : 1. No external SD card support 2. Available color is only White 3. Less option for Silicon Back COver , yes there are lots of Plastic cover available. 4. Sound is less due to one speaker only , on Headphones its good. Pros: 1. Light Weight 2. GOod Processing , heavy games run smooth 3. No lagging in touch 4. Lot of Free Themes In Nutshell its a good option at this price , sleek and light weight
1|4|Very good mobile in this price range.. Pros: 1. 13MP Primary camera 2. 5 MP secondary Camera 3. Octa core Processor 4. Frequent updates from Mi 5. UI is good. Cons: 1. Only ~10GB memory(No External) 2. Some bugs in contact storage n contact picture display.(Contacted the Flipkart and Mi CustomerService, the trouble shoot provided by them didnt work)
0|4|dhassu camera crisp crystal display... miui 6 awesome good performance.... awesome features.... around 900 mbs of free ram good multitasking heating issue before update lill bit heating still there after update when phone is on charging and a low sound best phone in this range but not good for those who loves to listen music on phone but still earphone output is good and costumizable
0|3|Mi4i has been a good puchase until now. External features has a slim body and the non grease back. The camera is really sharp, does not go out of focus. Though the heat generation problem may be bothering those who are used to run multiple tasks at the same time. The touch is smooth and prompt. Dual sim battery does last long, approximately 8 to 10 hours with the 3G usage. Though I miss my Nexus phones stock android, the MIUI has certainly covered most of the features.
1|1|Please don't buy this kind of waste products...I purchased on 11 May after one moth 17 june mobile is not at all working touch is not working.I Observed continuous hanging.Abnormal heating..sound is very lesss..I sincerely urge u people not to buy this product waste of money.Try to understand my pain in my words.
0|4|Display of the is awesome,you wont see such kind of display in this price range camera is good in day light it is awesome but in night its not good,processor is really it doesnt hang it is really good in multitasking but phones weakest point is that the gets heated when use net and play games not too hot but they could have did to stop heating !! Otherwise phone is awesome ! I will recommend to everyone!
0|5|I was very surprised by its built quality and camera, as its of very good quality and just an amazing experience to hold it in my hand. Though I bought it for my sister and she was really happy to own it.
0|5|the phone is awesome. i ll speak about phone's outer body its a bit bitter, easily get pressed at the edges if get dropped from height less than even a feet. just use a back cover that's all it needed. All in all the phone is a great deal to buy.
0|4|Phone is really Good, Camera is Amazing. A must buy... Just little heat is there when you use it extensive.
0|5|i gifted for my brother . he is happy with performance of this mobile and requested to order another one for this friend.
0|5|One of the best smartphones I have used. Value for money. Very Slim & smooth ... MiUi6 very good OS, Excellent phone. Good build, good screen overall worth the money.
0|3|I have purchased this phone 20 days back.I have used Redme1s earlier.Many-times i feel Redmi 1s is better than Mi4i Pros: 1. Competitive price 2. Front and Back cameras are good 3. Good in speed Cons: 1. Apps are crashing suddenly 2. Speaker quality is not great 3. Consuming more than 1 GB by default without installing any apps
0|3|It is good phone. But there are many bugs. Like, when a airtel notification comes, it doesn't go only. Sometimes 20 to 30 notifications appear. Go on cancelling.
1|1|I had purchased this phone on may 28 got that phone after 1 day. I have installed a Game "Real Racing 3" play it @ home it was running awesomely but while travelling (or with play music in background) I face the same game run like a slideshow. 1 big and noticeable issue is that one day I spoke someone for 20 minute.After completion of my call I saw my mobile display got blinking continuously.after 20 minute there is no display on the screen. and from left corner I saw there is some water in the screen it may sweat inside the screen. it enter in to the screen from the front side only. be careful if you already purchased this.
0|5|Handy, touch is so soft. Camera 13mp good to click, battery inbuild like IPhone .......overall nice...
0|5|but buying on only ws retail so u fulfill with the any product with his review this product is smart faster and cool i m happy with that product or price ............
0|4|good phone with limited storage, phone contains only 16gb memory but the phone with these features and price is awesome
0|5|I have no words about this phone. It's more than worth of it's price. Speed is awesome, Camera is also awesome. Lollipop update is attractive. You can have this phone
1|5|Been using it for 6 weeks, volume is a little less but overall a superb phone for the price. Its so light and the looks, everyone gonna ask you when you carry it outside.
1|4|i personally really liked this product.. camera is just awesome.. look wise also its just perfect for me.. no regrets
0|4|The Mi4i is an excellent piece keeping in mind the price factor. Reducing One star for the following issues... :) All Specs being delivered perform as per expectation Few issues currently observed though are as per below: 1) If you are a branded phone user, you may find the UI a little uncomforting due to the absence of standard/expected software features here and there 2) Accessories are unavailable as the phone is relatively new in the market 3) Due to miniaturization , the phone is susceptible to heating and may show performance issues in the long run. 4) Speakers being placed on the back side .cause the volume to diminish when the phone is in the resting position(placed on the back on any surface)
0|3|I'm so embarrassed I didn't listen to the suggestions. I bought this with such great expectations but I am soooo disappointed. Cons: 1) This phone has brilliant specs and great price 'but' it doesn't perform/deliver to the specs. It lags a "lot". Even while using it for a thing simple and integrated as inbuilt-in apps (Notes, etc), while browsing through its OS, WhatsApp, FB, and you name it. 2) The camera is highly 'not' capable of quality Auto-Focus. 3) One cannot rely on Lockscreen notifications, its random that you will get notifications. An app (like WhatsApp, Messenger, GMail) may or may not show a notification; its completely random; phone's wish. 4) No accessories with the device; I've not so many devices in past. Even Xolo has nice set of accessories. I still love my Xolo Q800 X-Edition. It delivers to its specs and sometimes even surprises with nice features. 5) The phone is "too" light to handle, and also a bit too soft & slippery I've done the updates but no improvement in performance is noticeable. I do not recommend purchasing this phone if you spend or are planning to dedicate more time on a smart phone. I would highly discourage one from buying this, I would suggest going for Asus Zenfone 2
0|3|Swiftkey tends to stop working at times. 2GB RAM should be enough but at times I get warning about low memory. 1GB RAM is being used at all times, even if no apps are running on the phone. Rest all is fine.
0|3|This is fast phone and after 3 updates performance is better.There are many problems like heat problem setting menu stop many time and sound is less. Hope in next updates there will be more betterment. As on 17.6.15 I will suggest 3.5 stars. Camera is OK and wi is just normal because many IP DHCP is not working where other Samsung phones are using DHCP.
0|4|sometime phone got hanged while opening the setting , to revert back again we need to restart the phone
0|2|Phone heats up during calls and charging. RAM available 35% to 45% only 700 MB to 900 MB against 2 GB. Battery backup equal to 2m00 MAh compared to 3120 MAh. Software not user friendly. Front camera quality - very good
0|5|Great Display, fast, excellent camera specially the front one. No heating issues at all, don't know why people write false review for this. Fast Delivery from Flipcart as usual.
0|4|I have been using this phone for the past one week now. I am pretty happy with the product. It's user interface, though slightly different from my previous phone (Moto G 1st Gen), it is quite nice to use. Since I am not a gamer and use my mobile for calls and regular browsing, the battery life seems to be reasonably good. Only problem, I felt is that the accessories for Mi 4i, seems to be very less. I got the flip case from mi.com, though decent, is not that great as the moto g flip case, in terms of the quality and finish. Also there is no company screen guard available. Camera is really good. Overall a good phone and really worth the money.
0|5|Was using a phone 3 times costlier than this before. This phone is much better than that. Definitely worth the price.
1|5|Best buy at this price. A wonderful gift for Selfie freak. Nice Camera, decent sound quality and screen resolution. Overall performance is also good. The only con in this phone is that it heats during continuous usage.
0|4|Very Cool Phone with some good battery life. I faced few issues with the software and hope this fixed with the future patches.
0|5|Superb fon using it from last 15 days tested almost every game only one draw back is memory only 12gb
1|5|I ordered Mi 4i mobile and received it in 3 days. Had a problem at the charging point(Pin of the mobile). It is very hard to push out and in.So I kept replacement .The brand new mobile is replaced with in 3 days. Great Service by flipkart . And the mobile is Awesome. No heating issues.
1|5|Close your eyes and buy if 13k is your price range Not so much heating problem speaker could have been louder Rest you can compare with flagship phones. gud luck!
0|4|i was getting heating issues but after updation the problem was solved.its a wonderful phone easy to handle and the picture quality is outstanding
1|4|Over all a good phone at this price. Very good display screen. Con- No extendable memory No headphones
0|4|Well designed and very handy to use! Compared to other phone in this range, i would certainly rate it as one of the best! And as always product was neatly packed and delivered well before the promised delivery date! Thanks Flipkart!
0|5|Below are some of the Highlights abt the phone: 1) Camera Quality is superb 2) Design of the phone is very nice 3) Display is amazing Overall its worth to buy....
0|5|I have seen n number of mobiles but Mi 4i is the best among all. light weight, good battery time. all high end feature are in affordable price. what else we need. Thanks to Xiaomi.
0|4|Purchased this phone in first sale on flipkart. Mi 4i really awesome everything are good except heating. Phone heats if we use for gaming and calling more than 15-20 mins rest of this everything looks. Coming to camera its really really awesome like DSLR. Best buy for this price.
0|5|Best mobile experience! Awesome battery backup, fantastic front and rear cameras, amazing flash light overall, the most valuable phone in this range,
0|3|mi4i is a gr8 phn but not gr8 as its features shown....its camera n disply are outstanding but its bettery is not too good but satisfactory max 20hrs staying after a moderate use its speaker is very bad... But overall a nice phone a good resolution it should have been given a littele bit more battery backup n increase its performane on its speaker .. Thanx :D
0|4|this phone is the best phone of 13000. i like this phone because camera is best and feature is also best. phone is very slim and very nice look........
1|2|Pros- 1. Display : One of the best I've seen. 2. Look and feel - Great Cons- 1. Poor Battery - For a 3100 mAh, the battery drains out pretty quickly. The phone doesn't even lasts a day with moderate use and completely low brightness. 2. Slow Processing. - I do not have any games installed but even then the simple apps also open up slowly 3. Speaker Volume - Very poor. Mine is a faulty product for which I asked the Flipkart to replace. But they didnt and simply said that the dealer has rejected my request. The Flipkart First is just a way of taking your money. You dont get any extra privileges of being a flipkart first customer
0|5|Got product delivered on time and Flip-kart kept its promise as always. Slightly found phone heating initially but with upgrade issue has been fixed. And colors in phone you would love it and the clarity is superb. Thanks Vinay
1|4|The only thing which Mi 4i can be further improved on is the heating problem which still prevails but still manageable. Except this its an amazing phone to buy at this Price !!
0|4|Pros: - Awesome display resolution, crystal clear - I like the MiUI - Beautiful design, finishing is fantastic Cons: - Octa Core 2nd Gen processor performance does not match with spec, observed flickering sometimes in even scrolling the contacts list, not sure why. - Very sleek makes it slippery, must put the case/cover
0|4|I received the mobile 2 days back & very impressed with the features. The phone is working excellently. Camera is superb...the only problem is the mobile speaker volume is low.
1|4|Its really nice phone in this price range, i used about two month and never feel lack working with phone,just found small issue is that it's speaker which is on back side and when you play video sound not that clear because of speaker kept on back.
0|5|Cool product, This product is very nice, very light, remembering the Lumis 730, its the best one in its class,
0|5|i luv this product all features are great thank flipkart for selling this product i totally luv this product i have no word to tell about this product awesome camera both front and back battery also awesome
1|4|I am using last one month. Camera is ok. Mobile is not hang. battery is ok.One problem i am facing heating. Battery capacity is not like redmi 4G.
0|4|I like this product as it has bombarding features in mini amount.One and the best feature is its camera.Really a better HD quality camera than MOTOG2 at same price.Good Interface provided by the company really attracts anyone who sees the mobile.Also its Light weight make it something similar like iphone6.....:)
0|4|I had ordered this phone during the exclusive Mi4i sale on and got it on 18th May. This phone has everything, except the speakers. The speaker system is not as good as the company claims, but not too bad either. For a price of mere 13k, you get Lollipop, 1.7 GHz octa core, snapdragon 615, and a 13 mp rear camera, which is truly awesome. There are two different kinds of flashes, inbuilt filters and edits, brightness adjustment, focus, etc. Plus, the 2 GB ram makes the phone quite fast. The battery life is also good; the phone can last for a whole day, even when usage is frequent. The only drawbacks that I've faced yet are: 1. Speaker system is not as good as the Moto G2, so if you're a hardcore music listener then you might have to download some app from play store. 2. The phone gets just a little hot on certain occasions, but it's not a big matter to worry about. 3. It has started hanging a bit. When you connect it to a new wifi network, it requires a restart more often than not. When you allow the camera to detect age and gender, it hangs during your selfie time. These were the only reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars. Overall, I don't think you can get a better phone under 15k. So if you're thinking about this, then just close your eyes and buy it from flipkart. You can't get better features. P.S. Rest of the features can be checked in the website as well as flipkart. Hope this helped. :)
0|2|I bought it this mobile and using from last 1 month and I found the big problem is almost every app doesn't work properly, it stops app automatically for example the lock app after few minutes it does force stop. there are other good device available in this price. I thought it was good device but once you use it you'll know about the problems.
0|3|display is very very good butttttt camera very poooor picture quality..... my redmi 1s camera is much better than mi 4i very disappointed by the camera performance
0|4|Using Mi4i for past 2 weeks and found that this phone is good with nice camera on it. there are some advantage of this phone at this price range offering good display and good camera overall good user interface. There are some cons about this phone like no expandable memory slot, over heating problem , no headphone in retail pack , no screen gaurd in retail pack we need to purchase it online with added 50 rs delivery charge. There are other good options available in market in this price range of 13k.
0|5|Well built compact phone. Pros: 1) Good Form Factor - easy for single handed operations 2) Brilliant HD screen 3) Camera's really good - especially HDR mode. 4) Battery life - especially after the recent updates Cons: 1) Heating issues - though they have improved slightly after the recent update 2) Ringer volume is less especially compared to my previous moto e. Summary: A very good product in this price range
0|4|Goods: - Better display and good looking - Good camera quality - Better resolution Issues: - Heating problem - No memory card slot - No ear phone with phone Overall phone is good according to it's price
0|3|The product is satisfying but...... After 10 days of usage suddenly my phone stopped charging, so its a major drawback as only 4 service centers available in Madhya Pradesh. MAJOR DRAWBACK - less service centers and the phone will take a lot of time for service and replacement and all. MI if u r making so many less service centers atleast make the phone work. Period. Delivery - Before time( Well if u set the delivery time for 20 days its meant to come in 15). Screen - good HD resolution. Camera - nice and clear images with lots of options. speed - not good(phone lags on simple games) my mom sees it as an repacement to iphone, well given the fact they actually tried to make it so, its justified.
0|4|At first i thank flipkart for the fastest delivery . Mi 4i the best budget phone.. with excellent display and camera.
0|4|i have been using this device for a month. Here are some likes and dislikes of mi4i Display and body design and quality is most awesome part of Mi4i (excellent). very comfortable device to hold and use in one hand (especially 5 inch size screen). About battery backup i must say xiaomi did very good job, I am getting 1 day full and about 20% battery remains in the end. For casual user i may last long about 2 days. speed is excellent but after update i suffer little bit of legginess. heating issue solved by update about 70% but after some time device getting word little bit. And please use screen protector my device gets scratched so easily. I purchased back cover from mi.com and i must say it is best back cover at great price and fits and feel premium. so friends mi4i is great buy you will love display when you hold device in your hand. only just want to aware about heating issue . THANK YOU ALL
0|3|mi4i lacks the most basic function of a phone. it's speakers are very low volumed, lots of calls are getting missed bcz i just can't hear it ring!!! and also can't properly hear what the person on the other side of hone is speaking. there is lots of echo. otherwise the phone is good!
0|4|Good experience. Working fine till now. On time delivery was done & expectation was met. Hope they maintain this forever. Good luck to whole team working behind this.
0|4|nice phone by xiaomi.stands upto almost every expectation.beautify feature requires improvement.gorilla glass not of good quality.rest is perfect considering the money factor.
0|3|Got after much waiting during open sale.Good phone,But the phone heats up very much at times.not able to find out the reason.Camera is good.It takes about 2 hrs to fully charge the battery and it drains to about 30% at the end of the day even with normal use.
0|4|at the first instance was a bit disappointed by the product but after getting familiar to its system and the new device just gonna say one thing :go on ..... . there were a bit heating issues at first but now after software update its has got a lot better . its a real value for money and it maintained its manufacturers reputation in the market .best phone under the segment of 20k.
0|5|Reviewing after 1 month of usage- Pros- 1-Display is very vivid and bright, thanks to 1080p panel used in device and high NTSC ratio (really green looks more green , red looks more red). 2-Very slim and light, very comfortable to hold and dosen't feel using 5 inch display cellphone. 3-Camera is very good, produces crisp and clear pic. Cons- 1-Very low sound output, may be though because speaker grill is placed at backside. 2-Heats when using internet for some time, say about 5-15 min on 2g or 3g (not on wifi). 3-It somewhat feels fragile because it is very slim.
0|1|Stopped working after a month. Better go for a reputed brand than repent. And the service center was of absolutely no help.
0|3|its hanging and getting too much hot. Thinking about requesting for a replacement.. looking good in hand,slim piece and less weight
1|4|Loaded with features at very reasonable price...Good camera quality ...but no headphones in the box :( ....
1|2|So this being my first smartphone I will not be able to compare it with other smartphones Pros a good display, handy phone, pretty good camera Cons 1.Battery life is very less the fast charging is a gimmick as any phone will charge 40% in 60 minutes Plus the battery is 3030 instead of 3120 as shown on flipkart 2. The speaker phone volume is very low. Infact very Low 3. Could be better if the memory would be expandable.
0|5|The phone's working just fine.. The camera is better than I imagined it would be... no heating issues after the update.... it would have been really great if there was expandable memory and 3gb ram....... however it's worth the price.. and I am fully satisfied........
0|3|The Mi 4i phone Performance is good and looks nice as well. But is getting heated up easily. even with 30 min of gaming (like Subway Surfer) is making the phone heated up. this problem is making the user ignore all other good things about this phone. i think the company need to get this fixed very soon.
1|5|I have four Xiaomi phones,Redmi 1S.Mi3(2phones),Mi4i in my family.Though Xiaomi phones are well built,but there is NO AFTER SALES SERVICE in most of the states.Though software problems are solved easily online,a minor hardware problem renders Xiaomi phone useless,as there is NO AFTER SALES SERVICE.Neither do they respond to repeated email requests for help.This makes XIAOMI phones DISPOSIBLE ITEMS.Think about this factor before opting for Xioami phones.After sales service is as an important factor to be considered for delicate articles like cell phones, which are very prone to accidental damages. Recently Xiaomi has tied up with Gujrat based company QARMATEK for after sale service under the name"Pick Mi service".Whether your phone is under or out of warranty,you have to pay Rs 189 as courier charges(fedex).When your phone reaches to Qarmatek,they call you and for all minor or major defects ask you to pay Rs 9000 minimum,for changing mother board.Even if your phone has a microphone,speaker,camera,or a SIM slot defect,they insist on mother borad replacements on the grounds that they dont have a machine to remove defective mike,speaker or SIM slot.This looks funny.For Rs 9000 you can purchase a brand new high end phone from any Indian compnay with after sale service center everywhere in the country.If you dont agree to get mother board replaced(and rightly so),QARMATEK SERVICES PVT LTD AHMEDABAD,GUJRAT technicians allegedly replace your original motherboard and battery with a defective mother board and exhausted battery.Just visit www.consumercomplaints.in and see it is flooded with such complaints against Xiaomi and QARMATEK.Never purchase a Xiaomi phone.Else you will repent.Log into OLEX and see hundreds of Xioami users wishing to sell their brand new Xioami phones but getting no buyers.Flipkart should break its tie up with Xiaomi immediately.Take my opinion seriously.I have no bias against any one,but i have faced this problem and it is my social responsiblity to tell you about the consequences of purchasing a Xiaomi phone.
0|5|I always wanted to get my hands on Mi3 on flash sale but failed on every attempt in the past. This time I saw Mi4i freely available on flipkart I ordered without much hesitation. The phone arrived day before the expected delivery date hence kudos to Flipkart. The phone although having a 5 inch display feels good in my hand although one handed operation is not possible. The elegant white color back looks premium however will get dirty with daily use. Hope Xiaomi releases some more colors for Indian market. The package is basic with only power usb charger. No handsfree provided. Let gets started on my handon review :- Looks sober much better than in pictures Awesome display Full HD excellent viewing angles. Default theme and wallpaper looks ugly I changed mine. Lots of themes available when connected to internet. Dual Sim works well both are micro SIM. Network reception and call quality is decent didn't find any problem hearing and no network drops. Sound Quality is also decent although not great as Xperia or HTC Beats Audio. I hope the Mi Piston earphones will sound better. The rear speaker is loud enough however distorts at high volumes. 16GB internal storage is limiting only 10GB usable. No SD card slot. Rear 13MP Camera is awesome looks superb on the HD screen.Both daylight and night shots looks great. 5MP front camera is average ok for selfies. Interesting it recognize faces and age of people. Overall best android smartphone with a decent price tag. Only after sales service needs to be seen.
0|4|Over all i loved the phone but i am observing a bit of stuttering whenever i scroll the playstore. Is that how it is? Is everybody facing the same issue?
0|5|2 weeks of using this phone.. its brilliant!!! although you may take some time to get used to the new MIUI..... Pros:- 1) Brilliant Display... Best in Class....even better than Sony Xperia Z series phones... 2) Dual micro sim 4g enabled perhaps the only phone in india with dual 4g standby... 3) Extremely light weight....130 gms... 4) polycarbonate body.... feels like big brother of iphone 5c 5) Excellent camera... can take some fantastic pictures in HDR enhaced mode.... 6) Excellent Battery Life.... lasts 2-3 days with normal usage.. 7) Good external Speakers,,,, 8) Octacore 64 bit snapdragon processor...so multitasking is no more a problem.... Cons:- 1) No expendable micro SD slot.. although u can use the MI cloud storage.. 2) No earphones provided within the phone package.... was bit frustrating... Verdict:- Go for it..... best phone in its range.... and u can also avail freebies from the official MI store....
0|5|Unparalleled experience, total value for money,The feel holding itself pretty good, can use d phone in one hand, no fingerprints on the back,Appearance both of the hardware & software is superb,crispy display,good camera quality,after update battery backup awesome.heating is manageable.
0|4|OK, I moved from an iPhone5 to this one. The good first: For this price, it is an awesome phone. The MIUI in my opinion is better than iOS anyday. Some things I feel Apple should have had, MIUI has it. The bads: Speaker is located at the back. So if you keep your phone on its back on a flat surface, the ringer volume is compromised. Keeping it face down will attract scratches. The one thing I think might be an issue is that when charging the phone, the green light indicator (indicating the phone is charged) comes on at 90%. Something I hope is by design. Reported a bug to Xiaomi, lets see what comes back. Verdict: Buy! Tip: Buy the back cover from the Mi website, its original / not expensive / fits awesome / hides the cheap looking white back.
0|4|Till now its a very good experience and hopefully the performance will live upto the expectations. Speed is nice; Camera quality is also nice with clear pictures, Sound quality is ok but could have been a little louder. No space for extending memory so have to contain all data including the available space of 8 GB internal storage (effective space will be less). Nice uni-body design with durable battery. A miss is the headphone in the box which should have been an inclusion like other sets at this value. Would have loved this in black color though I have now purchased a black flip cover. :) Overall a nice buy and value for money I would say still. Go ahead and buy this..
1|4|Excellent graphics and camera, very light and well built. It does heat up a little on high intensity use but not too much. I am not a gamer so cannot say about gaming performance. Internet features works smooth.
0|5|this is my second product from Mi 1) Mi Power Bank is best for Me.2) is Mi 4i ,actually is good if u like iPhone or Nexus.so this is combo phone for u. all features are good but only one feature is missing in this Phone and this is Memory expend facility . after all this very good phone.
0|5|I have not faced any major issue with the phone. MIUI is also smooth to operate and fast. I recommend to buy this phone.
0|5|everything s perfect ! pros - screen 441ppi , pitch black awesome build quality dual sim bigger battery smooth UI cons - heating issues (being resolved) no expandable memory not same protection provided by gorilla glass 3 !! needs screen protector
0|4|I am commenting after 4 days of use.The product is good.the display is very good.Really worth for the money.Competitors should work hard to catch up with MI.
0|4|I bought this phone 2 weeks back. Here's my review: Pros: 1) Excellent display screen. 2) Excellent performance. 3) MiUi6 is awesome. It has all the required applications builtin. 4) Excellent value for money. 5) The looks are very beautiful (copied iPhone looks) 6) Battery back is good, lasts more than one day to me. Cons: 1) The phone is getting heated up too quickly. if you use 3G or any internet using application, it gets heated up quite too frequently. I have update all the latest releases, still the problem persists. once it is heated up, very uncomfortable to hold on to your ears during a call. 2) No earphones/handsfree provided with the phone
0|4|MI4i it's a good phone after the latest firmware update the phone's perfrmence is not up to the mark. phone's heating issue is resolved to some extent afer the update but it does get HEATED after playing some high graphics internsive games like asplhalt,nova 3 etc.. .Display and Camera are the major pros of the device you'll never get a better display at this price tag and camera is also AWESOME.... overall i like this phone but no totally happy with it. hoping that the problems will get resolved in the next update....
0|5|My mom moved to This phone after HTC one x PROS -Not very large (I hate the gigantic >5.5 inch models that have flooded the market) -beautiful screen with a very good resolution -light wt. with a good built quality -regular software updates from xiaomi -last easily for a day with a single charge -Nice Camera CONS -my mum is farsighted and The default font size is pretty tiny, although changing settings to "very large" does seem to make some difference with the letters but, the status bar icons stay microscopic -and maybe the speakers could be a tad bit louder
0|5|It's a fantastic phone. Robust, sleek and user-friendly. For 13k, it's a steal. I would recommend this any day.
1|4|The only issue I faced so far is that there is no simple method to sync outlook calendar with the phone.. Mi Suit should have this capability to make user's life simple..
1|5|mini iPHONE... masterfull stroke by xiaomi... MIUI 6.0 great interface. There is a lot more in this price-range. slim and light weight and android 5.0
0|5|Guys buy this phone without any doubt. Mi4i is gorgeous. My last phone was Xperia L and was confused of choosing b/w Zenfone 2 full hd 2gb Ram and Mi4i. Firstly i ordered Zenfone 2 and it reached courier office near to my home. But then i heard lots of complaints of Zenfone from my friends. Asus fans will tell that company will soon give updates for the issues in the phone but these updates wont solve those issues. New bugs or problems arises when updates are done. If you dont believe just ask zenfone 5 users how's their phone. It's been 1 year zenfone 5 launched and many updates were given to the phone but still there are lot of issues with it. Most of the zenfone 5 owners believed Asus future updates will solve the issues and now after 1 year is the zenfone 5 problems are solved?..If you are buying zenfone,you are making a big mistake and you will soon become fedup with your phone issues. Mi4i will make you a phone addict. I was seriously a laptop guy(full time browsing in my lappy) .I use my Xperia may be 10 minutes a day. But by buying this Mi4i now i dont use the lap instead everything was done on the phone. It's gorgeous display and UI attracts you and forces you to do something with the phone. Even when i dont have anything to do in the phone, i just simply unlock and just swipe left and right. What a phone requires is a great display that attracts anyone. If you are buying zenfone 2, then you may have better performance,but still the display is not great. A good display will make you a smartphone zombie. You will simply unlock the phone and stare at the homescreen. It's because of the display clarity. If you found any issue with Mi4i,the same issue will be there in zenfone 2! Only disadvantage of Mi4i is there is no external memory card facility.
0|5|Mi 4i is simply awesome and for the price range that it gets ,I call it the affordable apple. No heating issues.Its the best phone in this price range.
0|5|I have been using this phone for 4 days now. I have always been a user of a motorola or iPhone user right from my first cell phone. When comparing to those phones this one does not look or feel like a cheap Chinese phone. Display is very good and responds to touches very well. I have not experienced the heating issue yet ( I must admit I am not into gaming much) either while making calls or charging or even when reading stuff. The battery lasts me for more than a day. Every day I keep the phone for charging around the same time and it takes little over 2 hours to go from around 20% to 100%. Either the wi-fi or cell data connection will always be switched on on my phone and still battery lasts for a day. Another nice thing is the amount of customization one could do with MIUI. There are many videos in youtube which explains this. One gripe that I have is about the speaker provided. If you are more than a few feet away from the phone there are chances that you are going to miss that call because you will not hear the phone ringing. The music player is decent but felt that it is not as intuitive as the player in Motorola Razr may be because I am not as used to this one. Overall, I am pretty happy with this handset (till now!)
0|5|mighty beauty mi4i Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing (here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing, its quite common , i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating, gets warm during browsing) i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly.
0|5|I have been using this phone for a week now after the update there doesnt seems to be any problem at all. TOUCH is awesome, camera is gud too though the memory 10 gb seems to be low. Good battery runs a whole day with 50% charge for a normal user.
0|4|I have bought it few weeks back... with 10% discount on it.. thanks to flipkart.. 1.phone is really cool to look.. very light. 2.Nice performance. 3.No much of heating after the update.(heats up very fast when on call). 4.Dail doesn't work while your on call(may be defect in only my phone, not sure.) 5.Camera is awesome in day light..(Night its ok not pretty good) Worth buying it..
0|4|Bottom Line First: Great phone, well worth the money. Don't think, go for it. you wont regret it. Its a Great phone in this price range, i bought it for my wife and she really liked it. she is been using it for couple of weeks, and we haven't faced any major issues like heating etc. Like many said earlier, heating issue might be related to system update which you should do before start using your phone. I updated the OS as soon as i got the phone. Best part about this phone is, for almost 5" display, it's not that big and can easily fit into pants/jeans pocket. Pros: Awesome display, loved it. Thin and slim design, easy to hold and body is decent quality. doesn't give you a cheap phone look. Camera is decent, could be better but then again considering the price, its not bad. HDR works great. Cons: Sound, its crisp and clear but on low side. should have been bit higher. I would only say , go for it. in this price Range, i don't think any other phone can beat it.
0|5|This phone is really a great product from Xiaomi.. Just go for it without any doubt. The display is really fantastic with full HD. You can play games without any lag. The battery backup is not questionable.If I charge once,I need not charge it for two days even after using it continuously. Tip:- Never mix up two or more themes using the "Customize" button in the theme store.It'll just mess up your phone and give a black screen of death.Then you'll have to reset the phone all together. In all its amazing!!! Go for it and thank you flipkart.
1|5|Just one word for this phone. Genius. Loving the experience of it. + everything - could provide headphone with the box
0|2|I bought this product less than a month back, started facing trouble in charging as it stops charging abruptly , although I have enjoyed all features of this product, but what will I enjoy without charge in the phone! I need to visit the servicing center to get the issue resolved or clarified.
0|3|I HAVE USED MI4I FOR AROUNG 25 DAYS. IT IS VERY GOOD PHONE EXCEPT HEATING ISSUE. YOU MAY USE IT IN WINTERS AS BLOWER AS WELL AS A PHONE.
0|5|After the 800MB update its a super awesome phone with super quality camera, and the battery back up with moderate usagThe display is also amazing.,...... And with 3G ohhhh the speed simply switching to this phone gave me Amazing!!!!!!! Heating issue s not much... Normal amount of heating that happens with any other floor....
0|4|Has good specs nice touch and picture quality battery backup is also pretty for business users if you are in gaming you won't like this phone. It heats too much while while playing and charging. Its nice phone value for money :) Recommendations only for business user, I am happy with it. good Job MI
0|5|This phone is amazing. A phone with a 5" 1080p screen, 2 GB RAM, amazing 13 MP camera for only 13k. This is excellent value for money. My family has purchased 3 Mi4i phones.They are excellent. The screens are not well calibrated, and all three phones have slightly different screen temperatures. But overall brightness is very good. The weakest link of this phone hardware is its processor. Xiaomi should have used old Snapdragon 800 like they did on Mi3 instead of Snapdragon 615 which is not very good. Xiaomi should concentrate in better quality control as well as after sales service. Overall I am very happy with this phone. Especially its camera and screen are absolutely amazing.
0|4|This phone indeed delivers all the features that it offers. It is a great buy for a very reasonable price. The phone is at par (and even better) in comparison to its other contenders from different brands (including iPhone for its camera). I have been using this phone only for about a month now and it has been working perfectly well.
0|4|i got this in the flash sale on 4th. so this is my review after 5 days of use. first of all amazing looks n very light phone. camera is good. does heat but its reduced after 800mb update. battery lasts more than a day(i used it only for social networking, mild gaming and downloading other apps) screen is probably the best u can get in a mid range phone sound is ok ok no EARPHONES provided and no expandable memory is the only flaws i found in this phone but it doesn't really matter much to me cause all i need is space for around 400 songs, around 500 pics n around 100 videos n rarely some movie for which 10gb user memory is more than enough. but for earphones we need to buy the mi piston earphones again.
0|5|I am personally a gamer but i was not disappointed by its performance. Design and durability is where this phone scores the most and the cameras are awesome too. If you are a causal gamer then go ahead and buy but it is not for hardcore gamers. BEST DISPLAY IN PHONES UNDER 25K BETTER THAN ONEPLUS ONE. Plz like it so more ppl will be aware of the cons and pros of this phone. Edit:-The phone runs cooler now and i dont know how xiaomi managed it.The update seems to be working now and when i checked the stats the CPU Usage was only 3% when idle so that is great. Secondly the camera is a beast,not even xolo black comes close. And now it does get only slightly warm while playing asphalt 8 and BIA3. So now go on and buy the best in under 15k bcoz this looks more premium than Mi4.
1|4|Mi4i is a good product for the price offered, I am using this phone around a month and not found any major flaw, initially there is heat issue when we use the device for high end apps and 3G. Later the problem reduced, after installing the update.
0|4|VERY IMPORTANT Xiomi mentions that it it uses sony/samsung camera on Mi4i . How can I find out that a specific unit has the sony camera or not ? It not at all justified that initially for good camera reviews they will supply units with sony camera & then use cheaper samsung camera for later units...
1|4|Fianally got good phone after do research for 2 months 1.Battery backup :-2 days for normal usage 1 day for heavy usage(1 hr youtbe,1.5 hrs call,30 min video capture,1 hr wastup,1 hr browsing ,30 min music play) 2.it gets heated up only if u play games, play videos and camera and is nomal behaviour in all the phones 3.Very good UI 4.Light and compact
0|3|PROS- 1.Excellent design & display. 2.Terrific camera 1 & 2 . 3.Decent battery back up. 4.Good processor speed. CONS- 1.Poor camera in low light, even with flash. 2.Not a scratch proof screen, i got a scratch on my mobile screen. 3.Data enabling will not work occasionally. 4.Lack of accessories along with the mobile & service centers. 5.Low speaker volume. 6.Heats while moderate usage. I BOUGHT 2 MOBILES 2 WEEKS AGO AND I AM GIVING THIS REVIEW.
0|4|Its an amazing product from xiomi,before had heating issue but it got fixed after last update.The only -ve of the phone is storage capacity 16 GB is not enough it would be 100/100 from me if it had expandable storage.
0|4|I have purchased this mobile 4 days back.The first and best adv of Mi 4i is its camera clarity and screen clarity,which is really impressive. and second is it is portable,able to be easily carried, especially because being of a lighter in weight. but what I felt bad about it is there is no slot available for Sd card and getting heated while mobile is getting charged. Ofcourse apart from these two cons, I advise you can go for this mobile.
1|5|Expected a phone thats a cheap close of Mi4 but when I unboxed it the phone really amazed me. The build quality is good, infact it doesn't look cheap! UI is a little complicated when u use it first and it runs smoothly. No lags at all till now.
0|4|Phone is overall a great phone only it need some improvement like the battery life the battery lasts for 1 day but other mi phone even last for 3-4 days i think you all should resolve this problem no heating issues best camera amazing phone hats of to mi and flipkart ! Thank you mi for best phone ! Thank you flipkart for fast delivery ever !!! Only resolve the battery backup problem fix that and ensure that the then last up around 2 days enough giving 4 stars but if you will fix that battery backup problem then i am going to give you 5 stars !!!
0|5|After looking and comparing many mobiles below 15000rs, finally got the best mobile.. Fully satisfied with mi 4i.. The full hd display is amazing nd u'll definitely fall in luv wid it.. Cheers!!!
0|5|I bought this beauty a few weeks back. Since I haven't previously owned many high end mobile phones I can't really compare with other phones, but this is a great device to own. The basics are intact and delivered as per expectation - screen resolution is fantastic. Multi-tasking is smooth and device temperature issues have been finally solved by Xiaomi with their latest update (I got it ~ 7th June 2015) PROS - Everything you like in the specs :) + Exceptional variety of user-defined settings due to MiUi ROM I presume. CONS - - MiUi is not the same as stock and android, you need to play around a bit to get used to it - Battery life is not exceptional however it'll survive for a day with moderate use
0|4|Phone performance is too good. But I am facing one problem with micro phone during Skype calling. Person at peer end not able to hear my voice. I hope next software upgrade would solve this issue.
0|3|Performance wise phone is good but sometimes there are network problems and i am not able to open play store and Google drive.
1|4|Using this phone since last one month, this is really an great phone. Very good battery backup and i am not facing any heating issue, little bit heating but i think this is common. Off-cource i am not playing any game but i am using 3g or WiFi continuously. Overall i am satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!
0|5|For this price and feature Mi 4i really rocks + Andriod 5 + 2GB RAM + 4G - Loving the speed with the device and airtel - heats up sometimes Overall 9 out 10
0|1|This set is not at all worth buying. It get heat up very soon & software also not works speciafically in my handset. Flipkart image is on toss as they are not able to return Mi4i and give superficial reasons and solutions everyday. really got fade up talking to them daily. Never ever but Mi4i from flipkart as you cant do anything once it will be delivered. no Service centers.
0|1|Bought this phone 3 weeks back. Initially experienced some low volume issues but later with an upgrades this problem is sorted out. Camera is 13 Meg with great quality of picture but it's good only for stand still photos. Small movement in object will cause distortion. Touch has got some serious issues like some times doesn't work. While taking the phone out of pocket to pick up a call some times automatically rejects the call. Apps window traversing has got some issues. With multiple apps some times going back to previous window jump to another app unexpectedly. Good battery backup of 2 days - this is appreciated compared to other products in market. Lots of signal issues, many times caller get response as switched off /not reachable even if I am able to make a call / access data / receive SMS same time. Xiaomi should focus more on stability while dealing first time with Qualcomm chip sets.
0|3|I have recently bought this product smooth touch good battery backup awesome camera .Its overall good product but get heat up very soon
0|5|-The camera quality was shockingly amazing ,the images are better than how we actually see it. -The user interface is very good. -Got antutu benchmark of 39000. -Not much heating issues. -No lags. -This is a must buy for those who love to take photos. -Customizable themes are awesome.
0|4|I'm sure one must have read all good reviews and know how good a phone it is at this price so let me just point out a few cons in there which will help one finalise. 1. Gets heated up a lot. Even after all the upgrades it gets heated a lot. 2. Hangs for dialing calls quite often All other apps seems to be working great and in middle of all those apps when I try making a call, it simply doesn't respond. Then I need to dismiss all apps (which is a very easy thing to do) and then all seems fine Rest all is just great for a price even 5k higher than this. The best part I like is both slots are LTE. That means I don't need to switch my SIMs ever.
0|3|had this phone for few days.. Really like it compared to the current note 3. No heating problems. Good display. Decent battery life. I actually like MIUI experience. Best value for the money After extended usage - it freezes after a day long usage. worst thing is that contacts get messed up reducing it to 3 star
0|5|Thank you flipkart for delivering this in one day. This was my first android phone(previous to this it was Nokia Lumia). Purchased this product 2 days back and was thrilled. The phone looks awesome and also packing was good. If you are looking for a nice mid range android mobile, you should not think much and go for this. It is worth the price. Initially I thought there will be some issues with the speaker after reading some of the previous reviews. But now I think those were one-off cases, didn't see much issues with sound/speaker. Only problem that I noticed was it takes long to complete full charging. And also if you try to charge with car battery the phone gets heated up. But this problem won't appear if you charge it normally with wall charging points.
0|4|Goods: 1) Flip kart delivered before time 2 days before 2) Good Looks -Phone 3) Very good in touch 4) Best in class 5) good Battery backup ,Camera is also good 6) Processor is better
0|5|This is a good buy for 13000.I am not a gamer and hence cannot comment on the speed and stuff.This is a lightweight phone with amazing configuration for low price.The thing to remember is to update the phone as soon as it is unboxed,from then on it is a breeze.
0|1|Hi, I purchased Mi4i on the launch date, it worked fine for 2 weeks(very low usage), post that it prompted to install software update by Xiaomi, which i did and after couple of days, Phone is overheating, which is simply unbearable, quite scared to use this phone any more. between this my Phone is dead now, cant start/switch on, if this is the condition of a mobile within few weeks of purchase how can this last for a year. not worth the money, though there are few rich features, stability and quality should be priority. I am going to place the return, hopefully Flipkart acknowledges this and dont flea trusted customers.. looks like Xiomi has not learnt anything from their past performance issues over previous models :( Thanks Nagaraj
1|1|I have purchased an Mi4i, after two days the phone started to hang. im not able to make videos from camera, internet is not working. I placed a return request for the same your executive called me, i was busy and told her to call me after half an hour she was ok with it but didnt called and declined my request saying request solved but nothing is resolved. i wanted my money back from you people but getting no option to return it, so please replace it with a new one. I have again placed a return request, please action on priroity. Regards
0|2|Camera quality is very bad as it comes to 13 mp camera . Also the pixels splitswhen zoomed . Not worth for 13 k
0|5|Its a good phone absolute value for the money. in the starting it has some issues like overheating on the front and the back paneland some sound issues but after you update the miui which us about of 800mb all of these issues are sorted out.it is an overall good phone if you are not a gaming freak. a premium built . best camera in the 15k segment and a smooth running UI as it has lollipop which gives material design to the apps. it is a very good phone people should spend some time with their phone before writig the review I think everyone should buy this phone, an absolute vaue for money
0|1|Purchased mi4i . Within a week ,the touch stopped working . M returning it for a new one but would have been happy to get some other brand after this bad experience............
1|4|The phone is good to have for starters who don't expect much from the phone. No hardcore gaming and all. Just use it for plain old calling, whatsapping , skyping, browsing sometimes...it will do you good. Pros: - Decent Battery life as compared to other phones in the same price range ( decent and not great eventhough its 3100mAH) - Light weight , good for girls as they dont like the carry around boulders. Cons - Camera does not live up to the expectation that you think of a 13MP(rear) or 5MP(front), very ordinary camera. - Phone feels a bit cheap since its lightweight , maybe at this price range thats what we can expect i think - No proper accessories available yet
1|4|My Review is After using device 20 days and Latest OTA - MIUI Version - 6.5.6.0. - I just would to update the Main Plus & Minus of the Device and which may clear the concerns for those who read negative reviews. Pros : Look : Slim/Light/Handy Built : Good Quality - Doesn't look cheap at all Display - For This Price its super - Crisp clear - That too Sunlight Display works Neatly when we move to brighter area. Call Quality : Its Clear - Both ways - Loud Speaker/Normal Camera : I Feel Its a Very Good Camera - Both Rear and Front - Its give a very detailed images - (During Low Light - Switching Torch Gives good image) Touch : Very Responsive Touch Connectivity : SIM : I use 4G- SIM - Its very good for Both Call & Data connectivity ( Data connectivity till today never had a Lag WIFI Connectivity : WIFI as well as Hot Spot - Very Good - I never had any issues Performance : So Far So Good - (After - Daily Usage/WI FI/Games - Asphalet Airborne8/Temple Run - Web Browsing/ Switching between Apps - Only Once Phone got hanged -after that No issues at all. Battery : It lasted a Day after fully connected to 4G LTE/Wifi -(4hrs)/ Video(1Hr) and not much calls for Me. ( Stand By Mode - for 2 Days- 60% only Drained.) Cons : Storage - Available only 12 GB without any app downloads in Device Available only 8GB for Me ( After Downloads such as -4 normal gapps/Gaming apps- Ashpalet(1.5GB)/Temple run etc - Heating : While Charging - Slight Warm and immediately its gets reduced While Gaming : I haven't faced so much heat -that too normal only - Gaming I had compared with my collegues Devices - Moto G2/Iphone 5S/ HTC 816G - all gets heated while gaming Overall Main usage I have experienced and shared it here. End of the day for 13k its a good device - considering even cons - Storage issue can be skipped by using good OTG. Heating can be reduced reasonably by updating MIUI to latest Rom - 6.5.6.0 ( In these 20 Days- I got 3 Updates) which is the positive note that MI team is trying to fix the bugs through OTA Please Note almost all Smart Phone gets warm up while using extensively i.e. Gaming ( I have experienced in IPHone 5S also. Finally I am enjoying my device for usage like to Browsing /Watching Videos/Taking Photos/Gaming (I am not a heavy Gamer) and normal day to day usage . Those who are not heavy Gamers can easily go for MI4I.
0|3|- getting over heated at the use of only 10-15 minitus. - bettry life is toooo poor. - no earphones at this big price. - you can not "return" this product. - and flipcart has refused my repleacment. YOU WILL NOT BE SO STISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE. + but any other things are good.
0|5|Pros: 1) Good performance. 2) Excellent camera. 4) Bright display. 5) Good battery life. The packaging was good.No heating after updating the device.
0|1|worthless mobile, after 5 mts talking it will be 50degree C, complain for replacement they always argue with you net result they will not replaced, So before buy must be thought.................................
0|5|Purchased more than 10 Mobiles from MI & Redmi this one is also superb... Fully satisfactory products from MI
1|5|MI 4i is a good product in all aspects. Price is very compitative in this rang. Only there is no external memory.
1|4|me male of 56 yrs and not that versant wid android smart phones but came accross the same becoz of my sons and i happened to come accross the flash sale on 04th june'15 and accidentally placed the order and the same is delivered bon 5th june'15 at about 04.00 pm. I was really scared of some reviews in respect of draining battery, omlet preparation etc.... but surprising that : 1) display is too good 2) reasonable battery back up, 3) on an average 10 GB utility space after downloading number of applications 4) need to test the phone for other features; however as many said the audio output is feable is definitely a draw back and we do miss calls even if we keep the instrument in pocket........leave about noicy environment; lack of earphones is a draw back and xiomi would have provided by enhancing the price a little bit or would have compromised to settle for less profit margin......... overall i am no dis-appointed with the instrument and conclude that this is barely 12 to 18 months stuff and will be amazing if last the period of life for the Li-polymer cell provided...........
0|3|Everything was fine since 2 5 th of may and as of now facing issues with front camera wher e in getting dotted pink colour shades while usuong the front cam can any one please help for the same
0|5|First of all i would like to appreciate the excellent response and delivery of the flipkart. Later on coming to the mobile excellent device Good camera,Good touch response,Nice aspect ratio and i am completely satisfies.Coming to heating issue I was afraid of the issue before i brought the mobile but not much heat is developed after updation.Only very slight warming as in any other phones can be observed
0|5|am using it for past 10 days...it is one of the best mobile in this price range...display quality s tooooo gud...Camera is also another best thing in this mobile...battery backup is good...Overall worth buying it
1|2|many issue found in phone facebook doesnt work properly true caller as well charging issue cant charge my phone any more
1|1|Network Issue, Sound and Heat Issus Its got over heated when idle and while calling its getting heat. Very poor quality and sound quality is also very poor and not able to hear ringer. There is network issue, webpages is not loading, every time loading error coming. battery life also very poor. Kindly return money. No replacement. ASAP
0|4|I am experiencing intermittent failure to receive incoming ring tone, so missing the phone calls. Also when I called airtel and while selecting IVR options, phone restarted suddenly. This happened 3 times and battery is around 50%. Please note that I am using 2 4G SIMs. Above are the basic functionality of any phone and consistent behavior is very important. I asked for the replacement....
0|3|The first time , the phone had a smudge at the phone display.. Thanks to flipkart.. they had me replaced me without any hurdle...and the product was delivered in 2 days .. Cons: Heating issue , phone gets heated while 3g is on or while playing games. overall its worth for the price range.
1|1|From the time I received this phone, everyday facing some new issues..that's how amazing it is. 1) Initially Ringing volume was very low.. After multiple calls to MI customer support its okay 2) When I unlock mobile I can see all Icons in black. Don't know which Icon is what. I could only see black square boxes ...again this issue seems to be fixed as I didn't face problem from last 2 days 3) Now issue is with mobile speaker. I feel only 50% of speaker works. If I cover half of speaker there is no sound at all. Huh...Crazy phone... I don't know about heating issue as I never play games on mobile. I would like to return this mobile at any cost. Features are good but doesn't work..so whats the use
0|5|Great product with this price tag. Looks beautiful and slim. Great to buy this product. The screen is really full hd and awesome. Camera is also good but external storage is not there in this mobile. That is disappointing.
0|4|pros.. High Quality front camera plus dual flash at the back processor speed slim & sleek Light weight Dual 4G sim Compatibility Battery power Speaker is also good.. cons.. 16 GB memory only no earphones in the box.. In my conclusion, dont hesitate on buying this Mi4i... this is the best smartphone under 15 k. If u r worried about the memory of this phone, then dont panic, you can use On-The Go(OTG) flash drive for having extra benefits of mi4i's features.
0|5|I have been using this phone from one month as i purchased this on first flash sale (30th of April), till now there is nothing that i should complain about. Initially there was bit heating issue but after two consecutive update by MI now this problem is completely resolved. In one line i would like to say that this one is amazing and without ant second thought go for it.
0|4|It was pleasure to receive the phone as a gift from dad on passing 10th. Bought it on 14th May and received on 16th May 10:00 am Hats off to flipkart for such fast service with wonderful packing. Now coming to phone only one word " Fantastic". The phone is working superb . The camera is so great even in low light . The screen is 1080p which is better than even many phones in this range. By seeing my phone my friend bought it in electronics sale. The MIUI is like cherry on the cake . The phone also has some problems like it heats up and after the update it just gets a bit warm . The volume of the speaker is also low. Once the RAM gets 800mb you have to restart the phone. The main reason for replacement of my phone was light leakage from bottom of keys .
1|5|Product is Good One just be aware of flipkart it mostly sends defective piece 1st then a good one.. with good build quality..
1|1|Guys, please don’t go for MI 4i. Wasting money may not be the big deal. But this is about your ears. Surely you will get pain if you speak more than 10-15 mints. You can’t use this mobile for long period of time. Make a good choice. Don’t go for it. I'm also one among users who highly disappointed by Mi 4i and Flipkart. Sadly my return request also rejected. Don’t believe 30 return policy. Problems i faced: 1. Over heating after installed fix too. 2. Network problem. Though you turned on mobile and you have good tower, you will not be connected with internet. You need to restart your device to get it connected. 3. Poor loud speaker.
0|1|This is another flop show. I nought the phone which had display issue, which flipkart promptly replaced. The replaced phone is another big head ache. It heats up badly and just after using 10 minutes the phone starts to hang!!. Whats the use in shelling out such big amount and creating so much hoopla!! This is absolute waste!!
1|4|I used this for 20 days and feel there is some heating issue with this mobile. but performance wise very good. there is some hardware issue with my product that's why I returned this product. very nyc service by flipcart guys.
0|3|Good Phone as per expectation but i faced few problems :- automatic airplane mode gets activated when wifi is on then data is not enabled , data gets disable when wiifi is not available . sometimes hangs while cancelling the phone .. battery decent works one full day touch look camera above expectation little heating prob. if som1 is having solution for this auto airplane made kindly let me know
0|4|Best mobile in this price range but even after the software update it still heats a lot which is the only con i found out in this mobile. Its a best buy option at this features and specification @ this cost. You could buy it without any second thoughts.
0|1|This product was bought as a gift for my friend birthday, but unfortunately it was not working properly after the gift was opened. Have been 1 week since there is nobody to come and pick up the courier for replacement. The technical team is so busy that they only give time for call for resolving hardware issue over phone. Am i suppose to carry the non working phone all the time with me and be free for them. Kindly help us get the new piece as the left side of the Touch screen is not working properly. The mobile is still in packed condition.
1|2|Hugo Barra said that this product took them 18 months to get everything right..alas, so much time was wasted when the final output was tagged as "flagship" for India but turned out to be just a mid ranger with some serious heating issues. Right off the bat, I would say that Mi4i has hands down the 'best' 1080p 5' display I ve ever seen on a smartphone below INR 20K, and not to mention the camera is almost similar to the Mi4 and the Mi3... But the excitement ends there and then itself. Qualcomm thought of putting Mediatek to shame when they introduced the 615 Octa with 64 bit support...but really, its not their cup of tea and they should accept it that even if they try to improve it with a 2nd Gen, their best selling Quad Cores (S4 Pro,800 and 801) outperform this chip in almost each department. I even think that the S600 and S410 are nearly as good as the 615..anyway performance aside, heating is yet another issue which only confirms this theory that the design and the processor do not make a perfect match. As far as software is concerned, MIUI 6 performs as expected, but the skin is so heavy that I think a 2GB RAM is a must for lag free experience..but then again the processor doesn't compliment the UI and its all a very drab experience after prolonged usage. Even though it running 5.0.2, only glimpses of material design occur and feels like MIUI doesnt want to do anything remotely close to what Google wants to deliver through Lollipop. But that can be ignored surely. As for the other cons, the speaker volume is too low for my liking and 16GB storage can be a problem for some. Also I observed my proximity sensor doesnt work half the time. I had hoped that Xiaomi would offer a great replacement for the Mi3 in form of Mi4i because I have always believed in them and their ideology..But there is no denying that the Mi3 was simply the best phone that Xiaomi had ever made for such a compelling price, and now I am sure that they will never achieve that again after using the Mi4i.
0|4|greatest display ever seen awsum design great performance and very handy and light weight sound quality is disappointing overall a great value phone according to the money...
0|4|Hi friends, I am totally satisfied with the product and performance. I was using it happily for one week and suddenly my front camera got into trouble. It has faded out with lot of colored particles. Regarding heating issue, I haven't faced any kind of issues. Phone looks classic and totally awesome in terms of Camera Quality, Graphics, and so on.. It's worthy buying for money. But I am much worried about the quality consistency. Previously I was using Samsung S3 for almost three to four years and I haven't faced any issues so far. But within one week my camera gone. This is the only one hitting me hard. Requested for replacement let us see. Thanks!
0|5|its one of the best compact phone ever.best display,good battery backup,awesome selfie camera.i played asphalt 8,leo's fortune.it was it did not lag much.you have to compromise with expandable storage for this awesome phone. the only con is ram. only around 900 mb is available and also about heating issues.it did not heat up much.all android mobiles has got this issue so no problem their.i trust xiaomi will release further updates.
0|4|PHONE IS GREAT BUT I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AS DAMAGED ONE.the mobile phone is fast , camera is great , memory is also good and the speed is also good.
0|4|Ok so Iam writing the review a bit late, but anyway here it goes. The Mi4i is a genuinely excellent phone and worth every penny. The camera and graphics are superb . I simply fell in love with the looks, and the moment I saw it on the site I made up my mind to register for it and buy it . The form factor is good. It feel really nice in the hand, though I would suggest that people should buy the hardcase back cover with the phone since its a bit slippery and you can end up dropping and breaking it . Xiaomi have a real winner at hand. Special Thanks to Flipkart for delivering the phone 2 days before , so I was able to gift the phone to my father in person since the very next day I was scheduled to fly out for an official tour. Thanks Flipkart for making it special and Thanks for the Gift Wrap. Cheers.
0|5|Review after 3days use. I updated soon after getting the phone. no lags, no heating, very smooth touch. feels premium phone. i will highly recommend to others..
1|1|As I said try the Latest and Greatest in Technology world for throw away price , Worth for Money . I am a Great Fan of APPLE , I have APPLE IPHONE 2 , IPHONE 3, 3GS , 4 ,4S , 5 , 5S but before going for IPHONE 6 I was not ready to pay huge price . With lot of android phones in market , I thought to give a try with cheapest yet the full future rich mobile , so that If I do not like non APPLE mobile I can keep this for playing games . But to my surprise this XIAOMI MI4I surpass my expectation . PROS: 0) Battery is excellent even by continuous usage of 12 hrs batter shows 30% still remaining. 1) It has MIUI equivalent to Apple . 2) Capacitive touch is full responsive. 3) Hi Gamut display 1920x1080 is bright and brillient color experiance 4) Speed of Mobile with 8 Core QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON 615 is Awsome 5) I did not test the 802.11 AC WIFI , I do not have a AC router 6) I did not test the 4G speeds 7) Camera Photo clarity is Awsome 8) Display shows Brillient color with 100% brightness CONS: 1) May get easily damages as if it falls down accidentally ( not robust built ) 2) Phone is too much Plastic look , Even I do not expect Metal case for the price I pay . 3) Back Camera comes above and over the Plastic this is annoying as they did not consider this while designing .
1|5|Review after 2 days of use. Pros: Beautiful full HD display. Great Camera quality but a little grainy during low light but still decent. Feels good to hold. MIUI skin is very user friendly. Cons: Limited storage.
1|5|Product is so nyc within the price.almost having the features of iphone.Satisfied with the product . Cons: headphones are not given
1|1|Pros: Small in dimension, less in weight, great display and Camera is ok Cons: Highly unstable.. Battery drains fast, Available RAM is very less, performance is not great, heats up quickly, MIUI is heavy and its features are having enough bugs..
0|3|Overall the phone is ok , but 2 main problems I face is , 1. the phone lags and crashes some high-rated apps which worked without issue on my other phones. 2. The ringtone volume is a bit less and cannot hear if you placed the phone upright on table or bed, since the speaker is at the backside of the phone.
0|5|Guys this a great device from xiaomi.. FHD display is quite good. camera is the best, i dnt expect the camera to be that good.. it better than iphone 5s. if u want to have a premium feel just go for this device. Software is very snappy and fast.. i did my first update just after opening the box and today its the second update. There is a minor heating issue but its ok i will negate it for the dispalay battery and camera.. regular updates are availabe so its a plus point. The only con is the power button is not that strong. u cant get a better phone within this price range.. just go for this device its a flagship for the indian users who cant afford to buy premium phones.
0|4|only problem is slow charging rate and the usb cord is of very bad quality! everything else is just awesome. please update the phone asap.
0|4|Reasons To Buy Mi4i are: 1. Light weight 130g and slim at 7.8 mm 2. Display – FHD Sunlight Display 3. High strength glass 4. Good Camera Quality 5. Android Lollipop & MiUi 6 & regular updates from MI 6. USB OTG Support 7. Large battery of 3120 mAh 8. 4G Dual SIM cards 9. High value for money Reasons to Not Buy Mi 4i are: 1. No memory expansion 2. No earphones 3. Heats up while gaming
0|4|Its a very awesomest phone i have ever experienced,gud touch,both cameras(front & back) are exceptionally gud,great themes,with miui6.Overall it has a gud feel. But the only problem is heating,it heats while mobile charging,while talking,while playing simple games. And battery is Ok types as they have mentioned 3120 Mah,but is working like 2000 Mah. But Overall the phone is pretty gud.
1|5|Have been using this phone for 1 month now. I was initially apprehensive about all the negative views about heating of the phone, but after using the phone i realised that heating issue is very nominal, not as much as has been made out by others. Specially after the update phone is running super smooth with NIL heating complain. Display is super awesome, No lag at all, on moderate use battery lasts 30-36 hrs. it is totally worth the money and effort
0|4|I have been using the mi4i from last 3 days over all i am satisfied with the product except there are cons about the product: 1.Heating issue with out using the data also 2.There is no option for expanding the memory 3. other phones charger is not supporting 4.Battery also not removal other wise the phone is very good. camera quality is awesome.
0|4|Pros: MIUI 6 -Amazing UI ,Better Looks and user experience,and many advanteges Both Cameras are awesome!!!And lowlight images from rear camera are truely impressive and both better than any zenfone.... Amazing IPS Full HD display....best thing about the phone Nice Battery backup and 4G on both SIM ROOT DOES NOT VOID WARRENTY -best thing about MI,but check t&c. Very Nice build quality Cons: Battery loses a good amount even when power off and RAM is used 1 GB minimum already.... Both problems can be handled by changing ROM and UI.....And still 800 mb can be used minimum..so not a major issue Heating is a major issue for gamers....screen heats more than the back after half an hour of VERY HIGH GRAPHICS games in PERFORMANCE MODE ...not so much always as shown in some videos..and cools down after 10-15 minutes.... that's a downgrade of even 2nd gen sd-615...but it plays almost every game available... and benchmark values don't show values shown by officials after heating....cool down the phone and reboot and then they are similar... Though sd-615 supports many more platforms(like USB 3.0 ,4G LTE and more screen resolution) than similar processors,but heats and decreases the performance and lastly memory 16 GB-not fair for a phone called flagship'...thats a thing to thinkover but G-drive is now for unlimited photos and such clouds are there,only apps to store in that But still, Worth buying....everyphone has pros and cones. I loved this phone .
0|5|Awesome phone for this budget. some bugs still exist in miui which hopefully gets resolved.
0|5|First of all thanx to filpkart with great delivery option. B4 Mi-4I i used sony xperia ZR, Mi-3, Gionee S5.5, Samsung A7 i am using this phone from 30th May.. since i have no problem in phone.. Display is great .. very good contrast and vivid display... when i got phone first i update it and then use... after update heating issue is solved.. every phone is heat up.. in heavy multi tasking i must say that.. in Half of price of A5 and A7 u get better then this ..... only one disadvantage is 16GB internal you can ignore in 13,000/- otherwise phone build quality is superb and great fill in hand.. simply do not read bull shit reviews and dont get confuse go for it...
0|5|The MI4i is too good according to its budget, My phone does not heat up too much except while charging (but not too much , heats up as normal like others). The touch is awesaome and the battery back up is also pretty good. I love the Mi4i
0|4|Phone is really good but ring volume is too low.. otherwise overall phone is very nice. Battery backup is good, display is very good, gaming experience veery good.
0|4|Good Phone for this price, Ringing sound level could have been better. Mi Should do somthing to improve the Sound level...... Otherwise OK
0|4|very good screen, really crisp, battery is pretty good, get through to 1.5 days, worth it for its price,
0|4|very good camera, nice display, good battery, but do hang sometime, Not able to install Gujarati language, If anybody have successfully install Gujarati language then please inform me.
0|5|The most amazing phone at The most amazing price...It has got all what you need..Don't think twice, just go for it.You will never Ever find this quality at this price. And Flipkart Rocks!!!!
0|4|I am writing this review after using this for 7 days! Overall the phone is very well built. U all must be be aware of the qualities of the phone..I am going to write some of the issues I have faced. 1. Yes the phone does get heated up on extensive use. Sometimes i have observed it gets heated even for normal browsing. After the MIUI update, this problem has been handles quite a bit. But still i feel it gets heated more then the other phones, but is under control and it also cools off very fast. So i would say its ok. 2. Even though the battery is more then 3000 Mah..it lasts a day on moderate uses. if you are a bit careful about your backgroud apps....u can make the battery last for 1 and half day. 3. Although it has 2GB ram, u will see only around 800-900 mb available...and it gradually reduces on uses from the boot time. So if u see ur available ram is anoly 300-400 mb...then just restart the mobile once and u can see the difference. 4. The body is slippery. It tends to slip, But I got the back case from MI site and its great and fits well. Its bit sturdy and would feel great in hand and gives nice grip. 5. Speaker is nice but not loud. If u r in a crowded place then u might miss some calls. About the performance, I didnt notice any flaws...runs smoothly, display is awesome, camera is also great. I havent got a chance to flash a custom ROM. Once i do this would update the review.
0|5|pros Great processing power crisp display moderate battery backup Good camera clearity Good design Light weight Awesome touch cons Of course battery & motherboard Heating up this problem is with all MI Phones Lag in camera operation. There is vibrating noise in upper half of handset ie near rear camera mother board section as if something is loose inside
0|2|display is good over all its good, one major problem is of heating. even after software update it is getting hot i am using it since 8 days lets see if my problem is solved otherwise i will have to return it back.
0|4|I have brought this phone on 25th May and I received it on 28th May. Flipkart had delivered with in the expected delivery date. I would say that Flipkart always derives the Expected delivery date with enough contingency, thats good practice. Coming to the phone, I am very satisfied with the phone performance when compared to the price Vs features. Before I got the phone I had understood that I have to updating phone software to beat the heating issue to the maximum extent and I did the same. Update took me around 800 MB and approx 30 to 40 mins. After the update below are my observations, mind you I am not gamer, and I am internet user who can be rated from moderate to high. Pros : Look like premier phone, Nice design, Good camera with good resolution, Slim and Decent weight, Good Battery. OS Lollipop Cons: Slippery, Photos are bit Redish, Photos are average at dim lights, Ringer Volume is very low, Gets warm at long duration calls, ~10GB left after first software updates. I would recommend this phone to to the moderate users who loves to have good specs and good looks. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone based on my level of usage.
1|1|I have bought this mobile on May 21st in a flash sale & delivered on 25th of May. When i have checked this product came to know that there is a problem in the storage (i.e. Free space of 800 MB). Whereas the product is a 16GB stoage device & came with 800MB. Raised a return request in Flipkart on the same day the product is delivered. Got a call from Flipkart and they have accepted my request. Confirmed to deliver a new prodcut on or before 5th June. Received a replacement product on 1st June. List that i have checked after opened the package: 1. Checked whether there is any damage in the product (Exterior) 2. Storage (Memory availability 10GB free space out of 16 GB) 3. Data connection & Network settings Overall felt satisfied, atleast this time I got a perfect product. Here the problem comes, After all the lights been switched off in my room, a small amount of light is leakaged beneath the menu & back button of Xiaomi Mi4i. There is a panel gap in the mobile & it is not properly fitted. Once again I have raised a return request on 2nd of June. Today I may get a call fom Flipkart customer care & have to wait for the reponse. Here I'm totally disappointed in using Xiaomi Mi4i.
0|4|very good phone. great look,light weight . I think it has best display in this range. some time it heats. but its avoidable, I think there is no reason not to buy this phone.
0|5|mi4i is price for its features features are awsome been using it for 2 days...... so i will start from :- good: 1- awsome display 2- dual 4g is awsome 3- miui 6 is best custom rom with better performance then others 4- camera is just upto the mark , good low light pics 5- wifi / bluetooh are also good no problem yet 6- good gameplay in performance mode...lags in balanced bad; 1- battery is not upto the mark maybe not a 3030 mah but drains in 8-10 hrs with low wifi usage..... 2- heating problem ... it heats till 50 *C but still gives crisp performance , probably solved in new update 3- thr is sometimes flash colour tone problem sometimes gives yellow instead of white ... 4- 16 gb is pretty less for a movie lover / game lover even u get arnd 11gb for use thats all with it but its worth its price .... mostly heating,battery,flash problem will be repaired in next updates so just chill and buy it without any more thinks ...... just want to let u guys know i have been using mi4 64gb and it heats till 45*C easily so for a octacore 50*C is alright..... ty flipkart for delivery in 5 days ;)
1|1|One and Only Camera lets this great brands highlighted phone DOWN. At a price of 13000 and seeing a camera quality like Redmi 1s ,thats the most disturbing thing in this phone.
0|5|For me most important functionality of a phone is the phone call, which usually nobody reviews about. Trust me I have never heard so loud and clear voice call before in any other phone. In this I just have to keep it at 50% volume always while using headphone or earpiece during a call. 2nd most important feature is network connection, here also this phone performs very good. 3rd on the most imp. list is the battery which we usually keep looking at. Battery is good enough to support 2 SIM, great display and 8 core processor for more than a day without charging. With single charge I traveled out of state on roaming on Saturday night and came back on Monday morning with more than 25% charge left. 4th, build quality and looks. Its solid in terms of build. Of course you can find many better looking for below this price range. This one looks very sporty and handy. Show me 5" screen phone with such dimension? 5th, Camera. It is excellent even in a dark room with just flash on. Selfie is just great, everybody looks beautiful with it ;-) . Camera interface is also excellent and easy to use. 6th, display. It is too good. Deep black which make it very hard to find the boundaries of the display. What else to say for rest of the features when others have said it so many times. For heating issues, I haven't felt except during heavy gaming and camera usage. That too within expected usual limits. May be I am lucky. Don't hesitate choose this device at this price range. Yes, better phones as available in the market, but at a very high price.
0|1|i have purchased mi4i mobile thinking that it will be a good mobile but it is not . it is the worst mobile i have ever purchased . actually you can buy a chinese mobile and use it rather than using this mobile.....
0|5|I was very confused whether to buy this phone or 1+. Camera & Display: This phone's display & camera quality is as good as 1+. I don't know how 1+ camera is in night mode. Interface: Mi4i interface is different from normal android but actually speaking I liked it. I found it new & different. It is worth trying. All the changes which i could do in my previous phone Xperia SP are available on Mi4i. Also I found this interface better than iPhone. Speaker: Speakers are not too good but it is audible enough. People who claiming that they cant hear the ringtone is not true. If the phone is kept on a bed or sofa with its speakers facing down then u cant hear the sound at all. So always keep your screen down & speakers facing the ceiling. Speaker sound is slightly loud than Xperia SP phones but quality is bad. 1+ has the best speakers. Best Budget: I am very happy with the phone coz phone is giving me everything at its best expect for speakers that too at Rs.9000/- less than 1+. If Mi4i was for Rs.18-20K then i would have suggested to buy 1+. But at this price, this phone is the best and one can just compromise on speaker quality & save Rs.9000
0|5|Background: 1.this is my first smartphone 2. I am not a heavy gamer or app freak! 3. after reading the reviews i was worried whether to go 4 it or not with so much heating, speaker quality etc was reported 4. still went on to order the phone Pros: -Awsome Look and extremely light weighted! -Buttery smooth interface!! -Excellent call quality and sound -MIUI is great, excellent customization, simply beats any other phone in terms of it! -Amazing camera, both front and back, beautify option is actually good!! -16 gb is more thn enough. I installed few games and daily use apps such as paytm, ET, times of india, housing, twitter, facebook, you tube, flipkart, ola, uber, shareit, skype, dictionaries, inbox, truecaller, cricinfo, adobe, hotstar, bookmyshow etc and its taking only some 500 mb space which is less thn half gb. - Battery performance is really good reasonably ysage for full day consumed about 5-60% battery. Cons: Little heating yes, but nothing extreme as mentioned by some folks in reviews lock button are little too tight Verdict: Definately go for it!!! P.S. Speaker volume is little low but its sophisticated i personally dont like too loud phones.
0|5|Amazing phone I should say! 1) very good display 2) call quality is too good 3) 4G speed is great and connects quickly 4) phone looks great! very slim attracts every one 5) Camera is awesome, wonderful quality pics I got. 6) Good battery life, I charge one in two days for my moderate use. and charges 100% in less than two hours 7) No heating issues observed.
0|4|I have been using this mobile for 15 days. the conclusion is camera - 8/10 outlook - 9/10 gaming - 9/10 user interface MIUI 6 - 9/10 memory - 7/10 (only 10-12Gb is available to use with no expandable slot) battery backup - 9/10 sound - 7.5/10(quality sound but speaker sound is low and the output through headphone is also low) over all performance - 8/10. worth for money.you can go for it.
1|4|My wife has been using Xperia Ray for some time. The battery life was poor on Ray, which is acceptable considering it is a 4 yr old phone. So battery was my main concern. She doesn't use phone much. She is getting 3 days of battery life. Usage: Couple of regular calls WiFi for 1 hr Checking Mails Whats App And all those people complain about heating issues, I am using nexus 5 and if I make a call with Google dialer, My phone heats up within 5 mins.
0|5|nice and superb.. beautiful phone. soo lovely. worth. nice camera and battery and marvelour display. I suggest others to buy this phone
0|5|Quite frankly phone of this caliber and at this price has set a market standard for upcoming mobile phones. Do remember to update the firmware (~800 MB) before commenting or providing bad reviews. Pros : 1. Excellent Battery life .Lasts for than 1 day with moderate usage ( Wifi 3-4 Hrs , Calls 2-3 Hrs ). 2. Superb Camera ( Set Camera quality to High from default Standard ) . Front Cam is a killer for Selfie. 3. Crisp and Clear 1080p display . I am sure most of the people do not use 1080p in their TV's and Laptops so appreciate the display. 4. Good performance . Octa core does its work although bit of CPU management by Xiaomi would have been nice. Cons 1. Low speaker volume 2. Ringtone sound is not prominent and bit on low side. Although there are few Cons but hardly matter due to Killer pricing and performance.Happy buying..
1|5|Display, Battery, Camera, User interface, Features, Response times this light weight phone rocks in all departments. Getting 1.5 days for battery life with full on usage.! Heating problem got fixed with latest OTA update. Downsides I noticed are storage (no expansion and you have to live with 12gb internal storage) and sound levels are bit low so you may miss some phone calls if you choose a not so alarming ringtone. I would still recommend this to anyone even with these 2 cons.
0|5|I've got Mi 4i on 11th may it has a defect in its camera, and I requested for the replacement and the technical team from Flipkart responded well, and they approved for the replacement and I got the new one on 1st June.
0|3|sound quality of phone is not as good after one mnth automatically low in every player (mx player, music, Play music etc.) less star for sound
0|3|Heating is still happening after all latest updates, installed only 1 game and heats like iron box. the speed is ok, plastic pannel, low sound quality. Rest all is good. . @Buyers: buy this if you are gonna be at office or at home, cnt use this if you take this phone out.
0|1|This mobile has severe heating issues and the software update did not help at all. It feels like furnace within few seconds of turning on wi-fi and starting an application(twitter in my case). My fingers are feeling like roasted. Look and build is good but an unusable device. In fact I doubt whether they do basic testing before releasing this phone and they do guinea pig testing on us.
1|1|I bought Mi4i i am using of 10 days the mobile is heating and restart during the call i contact with the Flipcart but they dont return the product always they promise for return the product but the dont...
1|5|I dont write long reviews , cause i think they often beat the purpose . Phone does heat up sometime but look if your gonna record in HD @ 1080 phone will heat up , My nexus 5 did , which is 2 as expensive as this and thrice as shitter than MI4I Its a good Phone , Great Camera and Good review , Best Phone in budget in 13 k range which beats upto 30 k phones in Config Awesome Flipkart Service
0|5|"The Apple of China" very fit,small,slim,weight loss. **GOOD**PRODUCT*
1|5|working smoothly without lag camera is good sound quality is ok heating issue not there after lag gets heated during charging though overall a good handset at this price
0|5|First of all, the device is fabulous. This is my second Mi4i purchase and the device is more than expectations. PRO's: 1. Performance wise the device performs well in all the departments Firstly the camera. 2. The handling of the device was complained by some users but personally it fits the palm perfectly and the grip throughout the use remains consistent. 3. Hardware wise many users have posted reviews but here its about the feel of the device and feel is subjective in nature. My feel about the device is the one which you get with premium devices 4. Heating issue is resolved once updated to the latest software update.V6.5.5.0 which is just rolled out to users. CON's: 1. The device has poor RAM management even after the latest update, the available memory after cleaning is lesser than the other devices with the same configuration. If you can bear the less RAM then this device is definitely the best choice you've got in this range.
0|5|Very nice Display, Build quality, Battery, Very handy 5inch and Sun light display feature is awesome. Phone getting heat next to rear camera. Anyhow, MIUI V6.5.5.0 new OTA update is release now. Hopefully we will be getting soon. NO other problem found in the device. Go for it.:)
0|3|Although phone is good, display is very good, battery is also good but there many disadvantages also, sound quality is bad, even at full sound the ring is barely audible, if the phone is kept in pouch or drawer no sound at all comes. At times phone does not respond to Wi-Fi connections, Mobile Data and charging and does not show any error also. There is no option but to restart the phone. The battery is non-removable and the power button is of poor quality, don't know how long it will last. If you are short of budget you can go for this phone or else look Nokia or HTC.
0|4|This review is after using the phone for a week. I am a normal user. I do not play games. I love taking photos. Pros - - Light Weight - Great Size - Camera - excellent results. Even 25000 phones wouldn't compete - Excellent Screen - Absolute great experience - 2GB Ram - Enough is enough. Around 900MB free with installed daily apps. - Looks - The phone looks decent in hand. The plastic back cover is not cheap and feels premium more better than iphone 5c. - Sunlight Feature - works satisfactorily - Battery - 1 full day with normal to heavy usage Cons - - Heats up when in charging. Which phone doesn't ? - The Quick charge Feature does charge up fast, but phone takes 3 hrs to charge full. - Battery is quite a let down because i am just a normal user and 1 full day is not enough for me. Gamers would definately be disappointed. Overall the pros are much more luring to me and the phone experience is fantastic.
0|5|go for it blindly, its beautiful and powerfull, truelly a amazing combination. no heating issues after updating and user interface is fluent,
0|3|Mobile is getting heat whenever we are keeping charging, talking.. Radiation is high, this needs to be sorted out ASAP, apart from this everything is fine.
0|5|Excluding the Camera quality, I am pretty well impressed with the built, quality of hardware, wish if we had an option to extend the memory with an SD card. UI is absolutely wonderful. Battery goes with 4 stars.
0|4|Hi It's excellent value for money phone. Good camera, crisp display. Zippy performance with good interface. Lightweight and easy to handle with good battery life. I haven't faced any heating issues, it just gets bit warm, that's all. Only downside is too less storage and no expansion. I have zenfone2 also but mi4i outperforms zenfone 2 in following : Battery life. Camera. Ease of handling. Go and get it.
0|2|I have Purchased 4i through flipkart. It is getting heated frequently. I have read about the software update and updated the software given by the miui only. while installing the software update phone display is totally lost. There is absolutely no display. placed order for replacement of the phone.
0|4|Overall good phone.. pro: Screen is so good.. Smooth display.. cons: missing expandable memory heating a bit
0|3|I bought this phone 2 week back and I find that Its feature wise good, with great camera, performance and very stunning look, to hold in hand and in use. Till now some of the flaws I see is, even though with more battery power it do not even last for one full days. I try to reduce battery power consumption by using software settings but no more difference observed yet. Further, Despite having good charger output, It takes an hours to charge 15% of battery which is ridiculous, I don't know if any body else facing such issues.
0|4|Awesome device from Xiaomi.... Good build quality, very slim, easy to use single handed, great cameras front and back both, Awesome display Cons.. from back it's look little bit cheap phone due to plastic quality. you can feel little bit hot in long use. Overall awesome in Mid price range.
1|2|Using the phone for over a week and already raised request to change this piece with a new one. Flipkart not Exchanging the defective piece and recommending work-around. Reason 1: The Ringer sound is too low to be heard in a place of commotion Reason 2: The major issue is speaker ; the sound is very low even you keep the volume at max Reason 3: Noticed call dropping for few instances even the recipient is sitting in few yards Others please add your inputs related to call dropping issue as am not sure whether it is happening due to any other reason Software Bug: The Screen gets locked till the other person disconnects the call
0|1|PHONE GET HEATES SIDE KEYS ARE LIKE CHEAP CHINNESE PHONES SHARP CAN DAMAGE YOUR FINGERS VOLUME IS TO LOW AT THIS PRICE ALLTHIS SHOULD HAVE QUALITY AT THIS PRICE SPECIFECTION ARE GOOD BUT BUILT NOT GOOD
0|1|Dear Seller/Flipkart The phone is gud in looks and specification, but I didnt got the Headpone in the box and also the quality of charger and data cable is not gud..... Hoping to get a headphone
0|5|Phone is really awesome, Has awesome battery life and its fast also , I hope Mi 5 also will be best in class , really liked the phone , Only is it should have been in free registration buy . As we cant wait long .
0|1|Front camera not working after 7days, difficult to change the phone and to contact flipkart no authorised service centres in Mysore.......
1|1|overheating. not for multi purpose. no earphone with this. poor battery backup. 3g internet work like 2g
0|5|For people who complain on heating issues.. Please download the update which you receive...It could take a while to download depending upon your internet speed.. coz its 800MB but it does solve the heating problem. Pro Cam is very good. both front n back.... Call quality (thumbs up).. Themes (great...) Con - No Memory slot.. but as they say inbuilt memory boosts the performance.. Well.. I didnt experience any lag yet :) and hoping not to run into
0|3|Its been 10 days I'm using Mi 4i and I'm not really happy with this product. I would say they've had over promised about their product. Battery Life & Heat are the zero compromise areas where they're totally struggling. Again over promise in Camera quality. Its definitely not an 13 MP quality, may be its equivalent to 5 or 8 MP. Good: 1. Speed & Performance 2. Good UI & Display Bad: 1. HEAT 2. POOR BATTERY LIFE 3. NOT A GOOD CAMERA
0|1|Phone is overall good.Only disappointing things are 1.Low speaker volume (many times you may not be able to hear the ringtone) 2.VIDEO CALLING feature is not available.very disappointing.You must have good quality internet connection everywhere to make video call through skype etc... 3.After updating software of 800MB ...various apps like music,WPS office,gallary not detecting files in memory card..Unfortunately no help or customer care is available to sort out such issues. 4.Search internet you will get hundreds of problem people facing with Mi phones.
0|4|I have received the parcel yesterday and I dont find any headset included in the package, opened the box completely and found no headset. One more blunder from Flipkart. I want the headset...
0|5|i am using phone from previous 4 days ...It is a excellent phone. looks very cool and what an amazing dispaly .camera is also good at 13 k segment .no time lag. but phone got heat up on the first boot and the heating issue remains during charging or browsing or gaming .. but after the update heating issues also soved !!!. :) so now m overall happy ....and my friends,teacher, everyone who looked appreciate it... and thanx to flipkart for their good service . best phone i have ever used ... :)
1|4|over heating problem one has to download update of 800 mb for good use screen quality is good battery in 3030 ma not 3130 ma over all - satisfactory
0|4|Though people say this phone warms fast and heats to great tempratures, but after the update its great,,,,,, the heat can be handled otherwise overall great
0|5|best product in this price. i am using this mobile since 15 days and it is awsome. camera quality of mobile is very good specially the front camera with beautifly feature. Battery life is also very good
0|3|This smartphone is awesome and battery backup was so good but front camera is just good not too good . My mi4i battery charge 82% and then shows 83% to 82% not charged 100% .what can i do.
0|3|first cons than pro ! cons : - very hard volume roker buttons, not comfortable to operate - To music lovers - no surround sound feature available - Back speaker volume low not good as moto g Pro: - Excellant, brilliant display loved display resolution ie.440 ppi - Mind blowing clarity of camera which is 13mp (only these two feature I liked )
0|3|I had a Redme Note. I thought this would be better, but then I was wrong. Pros: - Excellent Display - Superfast phone - Damn good UI Cons - In spite of downloading the service pack, the heating issue is still there. Its a little reduced though - The battery is not as good as the Note. Gets drained completely by the end of the day. Also, there are 2 patches on the screen from inside, more like a water vapour. It looks as if the screen guard is going to come off. But sadly, its in the inside part of the display glass. I used it for 4 days, thinking it will vanish slowly, but I was wrong. Its still there. I have asked for return today. Let me wait and watch. I am sure, Flipkart will not let me down.
0|1|I purchase a mi4i and my review is below. Not a great phone speaker doesnt works. Hanging issue Heating issue Battery is not so great. Camera is not easy click Waste of your money if you choose this mobile I am trying to return my mobile and dissatisfied customer. Regards JP.
0|5|Nice handset camera quality is good little heat issue front camera is excellent but memory card slot is not avilable and headphones not provided by flipkart.
1|4|The phone has great specs but I a little doubtful after reading problems with overheating. I was told that the problem is solved once the software is updated but found out that it still persists.
1|4|Somehow the phone got better, i am really not sure how. I just vaguely remember that after the 1st day i just drained the battery and switched the phone off and did a full charge. After that it seems to be performing OK. No sluggishness in UI and normal operations, dint get any overheating with small and decent games. Heating is there still but only during games. I am getting very decent battery life of 1.5-2 days with regular usage like 10-15 photos and games for 30 minutes and calls for 30 minutes. Am getting Screen on time for about 5:35 hours consistently. But all in balance mode and i have never enabled performance mode. Camera is very good when taken during day time. Previous Review: ------------------------- This phone is getting heated like anything and just advise you all to just listen to the reviews and dont buy it. Screen and camera is good. But what the use, the battery capacity and experience is screwed by such a underperforming processor. Temperature of the battery rises very soon and you can see plenty of youtube videos about that. Dont even think about installing and playing games on this. I will never ever buy even a safety pin again from these guys. Return policies are very tricky. They will ask you to install smartchk apk and use it to upload results to their servers and monitor from there. In these three minutes they will easily fool you that it is normal and telling things like phone can go upto 45 degree blah blah blah. What can you monitor in these 3 minutes that tells you all about the phone and its problems? Just completely irritted from the day i bought this junk phone from here. There is never so called "return policy" in flipkart. Even if there are real problems with the phone you will have to stick with it. Thats the fact!!! Just don't even think about buying this phone, may be invest in some other may be costly but better alternatives.
0|4|some heating issues i found my phone. but its updating once no heating issues. but ear knows some problem in my phone. camera, call clarity are ok. just go for it.
0|4|beautiful product, the camera quality is owesome, when hand is on screen it seems like hand is running on a peice of butter. there is only one problem of heating which is resolved by 802 mb update
1|1|Please dont buy this product., There is only replacement policy if you get any defect. I am not able to play any MKV file ,when I try to play .mkv videos ,the phone is getting slow.
0|5|I bought the phone a week ago and I am loving every moment of using it. The display is insane and the camera is awesome! The processor works fast and I have not had any heating issues. I am yet to do the 806mb update. The only con is that I couldnt get fonts app to work on the phone. I'm working on finding the right app for it. But for this price and the features its a great buy!
0|2|Mobile is Good but this display touch screen ODI glass is worst quality. I bought this phone after 4 days, i slipped from my pocket just 1 feet fell down touch screen and navigation (home,back,option) buttons are not working. They show the video for mi4i lab test not trust that test they drop the mobile hardly but that mobile is not broken. This is not suitable for rough handlers. (one thing you buy the tempered glass stick on it then use this mobile)
0|1|i am using this phone from 20days, when you get incoming calls phone goes in silent mode, means you didin't hear Ring, During call phone restart automatically, apps stopped many times. i complained 3 times till today. first time they told me to hard reset the phone, second time they told me to factory reset the phone, now i will get their call tomorrow 30may15. Only good in mi4i , screen quality is good ,

1|1|Its not so good phone mi 4i and the space of memory is low and no external memory card apply on this phone, its hanging problem continuous and i am not like this mobile phone mi 4i
1|1|get this phone today. This phone is like buying a frying pan. It heated after 5min of use and you can't ear. So my request please don't go for this mobile.
0|4|Design & Style: Slim, Good Look, light weight Price: Prefect pricing for this model. Performance : Good battery backup (for 2 day), Smooth touch-pad, Speed connectivity, brightness of screen good. Hardware: Excellent camera picture, loudspeaker sound is low but with good sound quality, screen touch pad works great. Feature: all features as latest smartphone have (but some exceptions are there in basic feature like contact, sound, display setting is limited feature) due china product. Execpt All other disadvantage, i will recommended to buy 100% . i like it.
0|4|I purchased the phone in the 14th May flash sale on Flipkart and was delivered the phone within 2 days. Superb service !! Now, lets talk about the phone UI : Excellent, loads of themes and great level of customization available. Some keen android users might be disappointed as Lollipop traces are hard to find under the heavy Mi UI 6 customization. RAM: 2 GB as mentioned, though available ranges between 783 MB - 1 GB. Very less applications installed. But no lag in the phone so far. Speaker : I'm not satisfied with the speaker volume, if the phone is placed with the back down then its very hard to hear a incoming call. Final verdict: VFM phone. Go for it specially if you want to gift someone. Camera is superb with lots of features. and JDI screen with 1080 is awesome with special sunlight feature.
1|5|Value for money , it will heat when you play for hours thats all no other problem with the phone . used this phone for month working fine & dont forget to update the phone
0|4|Mi 4i is a good phone but phone become hot after some use and no external memory option in this phone. Only white color available only . this is not good.
0|4|can the phone be returned . its getting heated up very fast and there are also many other problems in my opinion camera is no doubts the best so far but i am not happy with overall performance as i have thought of
1|2|Lets start with some +ve. Screen for the mobile is one of the best and sunlight visibility is also excellent. Delivery from flipkart was also good and on time Now the real side of the mobile This is possibly the worst buy of mine in mobile,My phone started getting heat up after update and audio automatically started reducing from 4 sec and within 10 sec vol goes to min so i started missing lots of calls. and best part Flipkart kept me waiting for their service department calls for good 5 days Finally after the next update phone started heating up while sleeping too and audio problem remain unchanged. I have been told the i will get the replacement of this device soon. I suggestion to all the potential buyer not to go for this phone till they sit and solve these two common issues And looking at company software support its going to be very slow
1|1|As per the trend,flipkart was a step ahead in delivering before the expected date. A brilliant masterpiece the phone is.Extremely beautiful display,nice camera,lag free operation,and no heating effects(two updates solved it nicely).However i was BITTERLY SHOCKED,when in dark i saw LIGHT LEAKING from below the back touch key.! This type of POOR assembly is NOT EXPECTED from a Flagship device. Have filed for a replacement,,will update u soon.!!
0|2|the value of this phone is 10k not more than that . Heating issue is there . camera quality is average . battery is good . storage , again can be issue with 16gb and no extended memory card .
0|4|After using the MI4i for last 2-3 weeks, I am really satisfied with the product, never lags, decent screen, good camera, slight issue of heating but manageable. There is no phone in the market with similar specs at this price range. Worth Going for... The only issue with flipkart is they have offered a screen guard after the purchase, but never came, and there is no way to track it as well....
0|4|I ordered Mi4i first time in flipkar , i got it on before date but it;s a defect product i quires about to return, thank to flipkar to do this immediately to me, they accepted my quires to take return, thank very much and good & fast service to customer serves. only thing is XIAOMI Mi4i did not have ear phone, in this cost they need to provide an good valu ear head phone to us tis my quires to xiaomi and flipkar. thank u
0|4|i have update my mi4i, is nice, good looking but volume and ringtone volume is too low !!
1|2|Few things I like about the 4i: Shape Display Camera But these alone do not make a good phone. The phone lacks in more vital areas which are: Software - phone hangs numerous times Earpiece - poor sound Ringer volume - I miss practically all incoming calls Cooling - despite updating with the new software....it still heats up Network reception - despite good network by the provider, this phone has low/no signal
0|5|Display simple the best you can get under 20k Camera is also pretty good Battery backup is amazing last 3 days normal usage Feels very light High reception antennas- coverage everywhere Speaker is not very loud.
0|5|Initially i was skeptic about this phone because of the heating issues mentioned by several people. I put a facebook post asking reviews from my friends about this phone. All of them said that this is a great phone though they did notice some amount of heat in the phone which was manageable. I decided to go on with my decision to buy this phone. Trust me, I feel so happy using the product. There is no heating issue with this phone. Xiaomi has rolled out two updates (one with 805 MB and later on a 71 MB update). The camera is too good. I am a photographer and I am so happy with the results. The refocus feature is brilliant. You will get amazing selfies. The only issue which I am facing is the speaker volume output is on the lower side. Hopefully we will get an update which will fix it. Battery is good. Takes the load of a day easily.
0|4|Some Heating Issues, Battery is fine, Display is great, Performance is awesome, UX is smartly designed keeping the end user in mind. According to its value its worth buying this one :)
0|3|I dint find the ear phone in the box and i am highly depressed even the outgoing is not working and there is some error in the phone
1|4|Received the box with Mi4i phone and charger. The earphone was not there, when before ordering, the contents mentioned of Phone,charges, earphone. really bad that the earphone was not despatched, even though they mentioned it is there in the box, before ordering. Phone is good.
0|4|I bought this phone three days back. Let me brief the review 1.Camera is really good. 2.UI is also good(before buying I thought to compromise,but after buying it is superb). 3.Yes,there is SOME heating problem if you use continuously. 4.The speakers are not so good. 5.Rest,eveything is alright. Those who are planning to buy a phone below 15k,this is the best option.
0|3|cons: 1. Heating issue, even in normal usage (i.e.: calling and browsing), it is heating issue is there. 2. Picture quality in the low light (with flash) is worst. 3. In video, voice quality is worst 4. Average battery life 5. Didn't recognize my old SIM (I'm trying to import contacts from SIM card), Same SIM worked in Moto E. Pros: 1. Good Display and touch feel 2. Very fast. 3. Good MIUI 4. Phone size is correct size, easy to hold.
0|5|Nice design. Delivery time was quick. Greater performance and battery life. Mindblowing display.. Camera quality is also very good.....
1|4|i have a problem with my mi4i which is having front camera problem when iam taking a picture with my front camera the screen will get faded with small colored particles, and the clicked picture has the same small colored paticles faded... hope someone can help me
1|4|I just updated soon after the setup. So looks like they have fixed the heating problem in that update.. Good performance. Awesome camera & display. Memory should have been 32 GB.
0|5|After using more than a week, I found this phone is one of the best under 25K Amazing display........ yes you have to believe it, when I saw first time I didnt realize much but after using it I found its best specially in sunlight. Its really better than iPhone. UI - As always the best, I buy Mi for its UI and this is my 3rd Mi phone. Battery - Great, you can run full day will all kind of use. Its must for any smartphone Heating issues - I didn't face as I updated with its 806 mb update and a little warm after using net continuously but thats common in any smartphone. Its not like what others maintained their horrible stories. Not at all. Don't believe those stories. Buy update and enjoy Performance- Limited 16GB not an issue, you can use OTG pen drive if you need more. People don't complain the same for iPhone but here they do because they have the habit of getting Gold at price of iron. Believe 16 GB is enough for your use. RAM - Out of 2 GB , 1 GB is already utilized :( but not an issue, still your apps, games will run flawlessly. Overall - BEST. If your budget is upto 10K, then invest a little more and get this. You can't get the same specs and performance and super awesome display at this price range. I am even happy with its display alone. Verdict: BUY IT WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.
0|4|This is a great phone specially the screen and rear camera 5 out of 5. Heating issue still exist while browsing internet or doing Whatsapp, Facebook, Twiter Etc. It is totally wrong feedback that after firmware update, heating issue is totally resolved. For your information, I have already updated to 805 MB file which version is 6.5.3.0 and after again one small update was there about fix of voice, audio and thermal issue. Now my MIUI firmware is upto date which is version 6.5.5.0(LXIMICD). But heating issue does not resolved during the 2G or 3G voice call and 3G internet browsing. Only noticeable remark is during the idle time/Sleeping condition it is not heating. But all of us are purchased this MI4I smartphone for smart use like always on internet, browsing, whatsapp, facebook, twiter and obviously for calling and not for keeping this phone as idle/sleeping mode. i know all the 64bit processor are heating but this MI4I heating issue is not acceptable at all. There must be some design issue from Xiaomi either in the circuit design or in the body design. Because the same Snapdragon 615 processor are used in Samsung galaxy A7 then in ZTE NUBIA Z9 mini and those phones are not heating like MI4I during the browsing. So my rating is 3 out of 5 due to only this heating issue. Hope Xiaomi will resolve the issue in next model with same 615 snapdragon processor.
0|3|Everyone, I bought this phone a month back, below are my reviews * Heating issue (After updating the software also didn't solve the issue) * Network Issue (Call gets disconnected in the middle/sometime unable to cut the call, may be because of Android issue) *Speakers are of very low volumes (some times you will miss to attend the calls) *Camera quality is very bad(Take a pic and check it out in your PC) *Battery backup is good(Phone gets heated while charging also) *10 GB of memory is not sufficient. Please think twice before you buy *In the specification they say screen is scratch protected (But my phone screen got scratched) Please add screen guard.
1|4|it's good product. you don't need to register yourself here to buy any Xiaomi(mi4i) products. they are trying all silly marketing strategies to sell their products. wait for some time , you can buy all these products with 10% discount. I bought mi4i phone for 13k , the same product is on sale with 10 % discount. so dont rush yourself , just be patient.
0|3|Positives: --------------- Display Camera Performance Light weight Negatives: ----------------- Heats up after 3 hrs of usage Speaker is not of a great quality. Music through headphones is suggested Disappointment: ------------------------- So called cash back offers doesn't apply to this product. Citibank was offering a 10% cashback at the time I bough this phone. Flipkart representative later told me the Terms and Conditions mentioned on RedMi mobiles doesn't have cashback offers. But this is Mi 4i mobile. No convincing ans given by flipkart reps. It is an OK or decent enough buy for 13k.
0|5|I ditched Samsung favouring Mi and i can confidently say it was worth a buy. Good software customization and more than decent hardware specs. Now i have a phone that doesn't hang anytime and everytime. Bye Bye Samsung...
0|4|I ordered Mi4i on 21st May 2015 and got the delivery on 25th May, 2015. The following observations related to the product : 1. Build Quality is very good, product finish and feel is very good. 2. Display is indeed awesome and brightness /contrast level is at par as claimed. 3. Sound quality is not very good, as there is single speaker at the rear and volume is too low. 4. Charging speed is also very good, fully charged within three hours, battery lasted for more than 36 hours of usage, out of which about 16 hours of net through Wifi. Did not test over the mobile data network. 5. Call quality is very good.
0|5|I got this phone like 10 days ago and this has come out to be an awesome phone for the price I've paid. Really the camera is awesome, display is unbeatable, audio quality, performance, almost everything is "best in class". About the heating issue- those who post their phone heats too much must contact the company as it is a chance of faulty hardware, as much as my mi4i is concerned, there is not much heating, it heats but its tolerable. If you are a camera enthusiast, this phone is for you, if someone has 13000 budget for a phone, he's gonna have a hard time finding something like this.
1|4|Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage. Pros: 1.Amazing screen!: Its as good as any 25k plus mobile 2.Good looks: This phone is well finished and does not look tacky like the other mi phones 3.Responsive: The phone is very responsive and with almost no lag at all 4.Camera: Good but not great camera. Would rate it 4/5. Front camera 3.5/5 5.Weight: This is what impresses most friends/family. The phone is really light for its size. 6. Battery: The battery easily lasts 24 hours in one charge with moderately high usage Cons: 1.This is not a phone for gamers. The phone heats up considerably if you game for about 15-20 minutes. Note that apart from games the phone heats up while using heavy apps, but the heating is genuinely negligible. Not so while gaming 2.Lack of expandable storage: Enough has been written and said about this weird strategy 3.Charging time: Phone takes atleast 2.5 to 3 hours to completely charge up Overall, I would say that this is a complete value for money phone at this price if you are not into gaming.
0|4|It look awesome n UI wow Cool If who Simple Normal usage this phone fit well Only No SD card slot it quite disappointment Flipkart delivered fast with 2 days
1|4|This phone is the good enough.. Resolution is extra ordinary .. Camera is very good. Heating issue is there .. but expecting it to be there as its a new gen phone. Light weight .. perfect grip. Can face issue with 16gb memory as its not extendable. The disappointing fact is I have found that small scratches have been formed in my glass. It never fell from my hand . I used to keep it in my pockets without cover.
1|4|Its very good & worth for money. Explained below... Good features:High speed,new generation,easy to use,Light weight, Drawbacks:Memory not expandable,
0|5|-Best display for a mid-range smartphone – It’s a good looking device – Good camera – Performance will easily satisfy users – Battery life is more than other phones in this range – Gets warm easily. But doesn’t affect performance.Heating got fixed after the update. – External speakers are not much loud – MIUI 6 will take time to get used to – Storage will be an issue for power users – Offers great value for money
0|5|Really satisfied by the flipkart service and also the xiaomi technology update in this power packed fone. just go fo it guys witout any second thought in ya minds..... Thank You Flipkart.....
0|5|Guys, this product might have a few bugs like build quality and heating issues(which btw have been partially solved via OTA update) this phone is an absolute killer deal. Go for it
1|4|Its very good & worth for money. Explained below... Good features:High speed,new generation,easy to use,Light weight, Drawbacks:Memory not expandable,
1|4|After the last update the heating issue is resolved...which is by far the biggest problem for this phone. Also the software lag is well optimized with this new update. The sound of the loud speaker is also now quite good. Wait for more update in future which is eventually make this phone more stable and optimized.
0|5|This is an amazing phone at this price range. Infact all Xiaomi products are excellent in feel and use. Only one issue i hv noticed is the volume is extremely low.
0|5|Truly Worth and an Awesme Mobile!! An Awesme Phone! Go fot it without any delay! Its touch, its performance, its speed...jst mindblowing!! I dont undrstnd y people go fr 40k, 50k mobile phones when they can get the features and interface of those phones in this Mi 4i Mobile. Yes, It has all those features which can beat all higher prices mobile phones. Don't think much guyz n gals!! Jst go fo it and you will definitely be so happy that you wuld feel to tell others to buy this phone!!!
1|4|if u buy this phone, no need to buy an iron box. it can be used for both...no other issues i have faced wit tis phone...
0|5|The phone is really awesome with an amazing sleek design. The performance and interface is too good and battery is very long lasting, the only problem is the storage if you can work with 16gb then it is really the best phone in this price.
0|5|combination of beauty n beast...... My first xiaomi phone n it had made a great impression..... fully satisfied .... thank xiaomi P.S. do buy a back cover for extra protection from dirt
1|5|I got over heated when operate it and while calling its getting heat. There is network issue, WebPages is not loading, every time loading error coming. when I call to anther number and same time any call to me on my next number, I found Mobile hang
0|2|1. Major Heating issue on the ear piece during the call. Ear piece getting heated within a minute time during the call. 2. Network reception is poor, as the data drops very frequently. If I use the same sim card on other devices then there are no such problems. Webpages are not loading sometime due to connectivity. 3. Battery life is very poor compared to the Redmi Note 3G, even though it shares the same battery spec. Initiated Return and Got a replacement handset from Flipkart due the above stated issues and problem still exist on the new handset also.
0|5|it does heat but bearable for me...main advantage is screen...camera is good..buy quality is good...look excellent....fast charge...very very very fast gps...gps matter
0|5|Best display i ever seen... No heating issue in nornal usage superb 1 day battery back up with data packet ON, Overall good experince
0|5|Good product from MI. excellent Camera and Display. .
0|4|I would have given it 4.5 stars if Flipkart allowed fractional rating. I am upgrading from a 2011-era Nexus S, so my expectations from modern smartphones might be little outdated. Still, this is a great phone. doesn't feel oversized at 5 inches. Screen is great. MIUI looks cool, who cares if it's an iOS rip off. I don't game, but the experience so far has been pretty smooth, with me being able to open loads of apps and switch between them smoothly. Heating is not that big a deal. It sometimes does get slightly warm (everything gets slightly warm in North Indian summers!) but not too much to be an issue. Your mileage may vary if you want to run heavy games. The battery lasts for 1.5 days with always on wifi and moderate usage. The main camera is average in indoor conditions. The selfie camera, in contrast is great. I can't tell the difference between the front cam and the back cam in indoor conditions. Haven't tested it in sunlight but I think the main camera will truly shine in well-lit conditions. Operation is mostly lag free. So far I've been unable to use some obscure camera features (the app hangs if I use them), and the Google Authenticator app also crashes. But other than that, it's been a smooth experience and these issues should be solved in future updates. If you want an all-round phone for cheap, look no further. Special mention for Flipkart for delivering the phone in less than 48 hours, in a tier 2 city, with standard shipping.
0|4|i was purchased on 21-5-15, before updation of ui newversion it ois getting heating while charging, but after update of new version there is no heating . so many users facing heating problem, so update new version so there is no heating problem, over all product is good.
0|2|Phone is good. Drawback: Heating issue. Suggestion: In today scenario if anyone buy a 2K phone then it get headphone along with the phone on the other end I brought 13K phone and didn't get headphone. Its really very strange and it should be given by the company.
0|5|using this phone for 4 days now. pros;awesome screen, excellent camera, good battery back up, nice ui cons; heats up while charging, non expandable memory. overall good value for money phone
0|3|Xioami MI4I phone is good in features and display but it delivers over heat while using the phone and also takes over night to charge (atleast 8 hours it takes to charge full).
1|2|The Delivery was awesome at very speedy and in just 2 days of ordering it. Like everyone i was way much excited for this new phone for it has great specs but the happiness and excitement didn't last longer. Pros : 1. Great Phone at great this price . 2. Great Specs. 3. Screen is good. 4. the camera is awesome. Cons. 1. OS [ MIUI ] is very slow in making calls and disconnecting them. 2. Incoming call vomlume decrease within seconds and same prob with music player and all else. 3. Incoming call appears after few sec. 4. sometime changing themes makes incoming call disappear. 5. phone heats up a bit. 6. there are many bugs right now which needs to be fixed.. Please don't buy this if you don't want to suffer. Go for Asus Zenfone 2 way better with specs and performance.
0|4|Nice work by Mi for releasing such a mighty phone with excellent specs. Display seems to be awesome with brilliant battery backup. Camera quality is very good as excpected except low light feature. Audio quality is awesome but lacks a little bit in loudness. If loudness would have been a bit higher i would have given 5 star rating.Overall the phone is up to the mark. Thanx to flipkart for providing such an awesome service.
0|1|Extremely brittle... Once u drop it and its gone for always.. gorilla/corning glass doesn't mean break resistant. it might be scratch resistant. once broke company will charge around 7000 rs. sounds disgusting.
0|4|hi, first i faced a great delay in shipping about 15-20 days its big mistake of flipkart. it hurt me alot i never expexted such a thing from flipkart. Anyways the mobile is awsome and looks pretty. its best feature is its Camera which is great in its opponent mobile like samsung grand,yu yureka, moto g, lenovo. The big drawback of the mobile is its sound which is very less not even an average .it may be improve in coming updates and after rooting when available. its storage is also less then average 16 gb mobiles like yureka which gives 12.5gb user space, mi4i gives only 10.2 gb of space. its antutu score is awsome 39,000 im my side.it heats less then other mobiles even after 1hour gaming. i will suggest it forr all buyers who want a standard and good performance and wowlook (1980, 1080p) full hd display)mobile in this reachable price with advanced customer care and useful XIAOMI SITE .
0|3|THE PHONE IS AMAZING! BUT VERY BAD BATTERY LIFE! 3000 MAH DOESNT LAST HALF A DAY AND FRONT CAM DOESNT SEEMS TO BE LIKE 5MP CAMERA...
0|5|just amazed by the display excellent batry backup just one problem overheating issue rest the phone is value for money
0|5|PHN IS AWESOME AS COMPARE TO ITS PRICE CAMERA IS AWESOME TOUCH DISPLAY ALL ARE GOOD ONLY HEATING PROBLEM IS THERE
0|5|seriously guys ! please get this phone ! i have been using this for about 3 weeks now and there are glitches what so ever. and there are no heating issues unless you play games for hours together. those reviews about excessive heating are false. i would recommend this phone for any one any day ! the camera is also top notch !
0|4|I got my phone yesterday and didn't explore much but the look and feel is very good and the customized Android i.e. MIUI is also looks good which is similar to Iphone. worth buying.
0|5|Best phone on this range. You don't need to run behind apple iphone and torch your hard earned money for a greedy company. All features are world class. Full value for money. Camera too good. Very fast and smooth interface. Looks too good. Very brilliant display.
0|5|I have used this handset for 48 hours. The packaging of this phone is excellent, MI proved that its the best budget smartphones producing company. Don't believe any of the fake reviews here. The phone has some slight heating issue but only for heavy gamers. The phone's sound output and the quality of the sound is excellent. Call Quality is best among the all handsets I have used Let me come to the Pros and Cons of this mobile. Pros-: 1. The Display is stunning, Pretty sure you will love the display. 2. Call Quality is terrific. 3. Sound Output Quality is great. 4. Performance is Superb. 5. MIUI v6 is also one of the great feature in this handset. 6. I am a stock android user and I loved MIUI and the features the MIUI is giving. 7. Battery backup is excellent. (1.1 Days) Cons-: Hardly any Heating issue-: 1. Firstly update the phone, don't use it before updating. 2. I have used yureka and other octa core processing handsets. Yureka crossed 55 C. 3. This phone, I have used in Daily life performances like (Calling, Whatsapp, FB, Twitter, WiFi) there's no heat coming in the handset. Only 38 C (While outside it's 47 C) (You can check out my Pincode 522006). So no problem for daily users. 4. I have played Asphalt 8 : Airbone For 35 Min (4 Levels) It just crossed 45 C Which is hardly nothing for me. I recommend people like Daily users and alternative gamers to buy this piece of beauty.
0|4|Bearable heating Display is excellent Sound is good enough for this range Battery is good Camera is OK
0|1|Delivery process was bad. Looks like ekart delivery process is degrading. Phone is Bad, not as expected, touch responsiveness is not good. Heats up a lot. Battery is not as expected, cant even match Mi3 performance. I had Mi3 in past and it is much better then Mi4i. Power and volume buttons quality is cheap, loosely fitted buttons from corner is feels like loosely fitted buttons and shakes while you touch. Over all exterior finishing is bad, you can feel camera is not properly positioned. Built-in speaker volume is very low. Hardly audible from 10 feet distance. Very very very disappointed. :( Seems they have manufactured this phone in a hurry. I strongly recommend you to try Yureak or go with Mi3 then purchasing Mi4I.
0|4|Pros- Great display Amazing Camera Good Battery Bkup Handset looks rich (As good as Iphone) Good performance Easy to handle (single handedly) Cons- Speaker volume is very low Limited Space Heating issue will be resolved after the update.
0|4|Xiaomi mi 4i isthe best phone u can get under 15k. Along with znfn 2. Though znfn gvsa little better performance... But mi4i beats it in everyy other segment... Yes mi4i heats up.. But its the processor's fault.... Galaxy a7, htc 820 also heats up.. After updating the software the heating reduces but does heat a little bit.... Now to the pros.... U cannot get such display quality in any phone under 35k margin.. The came is also very very good.... I love the selfie camera... Performance is quite good.. Miui is lovely.. Makes the phone unique..... Everything in this phone is lovely... Except for a mild heating, no sd card slot.. N battery drains a little fast, but i think its my fault that i use phone all the time... Anyway, if u want to buy a phone under15k or confused between this and zenfone... I will highly recommend this..... And btw this is a very handsome phone... Looks elegant and very expensive...
0|5|To all those who have said that it is a bad product and with all those non sense things, I wanna say that it is a very beautiful product with lot of good things. First of all it doesnt heat up as they have said. Secondly it doesnt hang up....no sluggishness at all. Everything is so nice about it. It is a premium phone at such a low price. I am loving it!
0|5|I have been using this device for last three weeks, and I am totally in love with it. It has everything that a user would want in a smartphone. Pros- 1. Camera- It is a total delight to have such an awesome camera on a smartphone. Apart from the hardware, the software in the camera app really adds to the ease of capturing moments perfectly! 2. Screen- Whao.... U got to experience it to admire it. 3. MIUI- Although it is a resource consuming UI, and most of the times you never get more than 1 GB of free RAM, but it is very customisable and very user friendly. The animations and transitions are beautiful and I really like the concept of no app drawer which is something new for old android users. One does not experience lags, moreover Xiaomi frequently provides updates for various bugs and new features. 4. Battery- The battery is really a gaint at 3120 mAh. You get around 10 hours of continuos HD video playback (wgich is remarkable when such a big screen is kept awake for that long period) 5. Performance- The phone performs decently and does a fair job while handling heavy games like asphalt 8, frontline commando. 6. Call quality- The earpiece volumne is quite load and the quality of calls is very good Although the phone heats up with heavy games and while surfing on internet but that is normal and one just cannot call it a pocket heater. It is managable. Yes storage could have been more but then 16 GB (out of which 11 GB is available) is enough, when you dont store videos on phone. The GPS fixes really quickly and navigation experience is very good. At Rs 12999, I would simply recommend one to buy this phone if they want amazing camera experience, long lasting battery, good gaming experience and overall satisfaction!!
0|5|excellent built , ausm display , 5 inch with 440 ppi - nothing more you want at this price the only con is heating prob bt thats not a big issue a perfect buy
0|5|Well,I got this phone few days ago and I've been analyzing this new set from Xiaomi and I just can say this phone is best phone at this range. 1] Awesome Camera - I'm sure you'll be amazed with the primary and front camera of this phone..Just one word awesome....HDR awesome is there so no problem as it captures high resolutions images. 2] Long lasting Battery - I've not charged my phone for almost one and half days after I fully charged it and still the battery is 40% ..Great long lasting battery. 3] It has got many features like you can change the sound if you are listening to songs through headphones and earphones to other type of headsets available in phone already. 4] You can feel the power of Xiaomi from very first day when you'll buy this phone set. 5] Everyone are saying heating problem,but there's no any problem once you upgrade MIUI which u can get once you switch on your phone.. 6] Only one demerit I found in this one week is non expandable memory but Mi is providing Mi Cloud of 5 GB so you can overcome that problem too.. Now don't waste your time and click on buy now option else you'll have to regret....I am loving this phone .... Awesome work by Xiaomi...
0|3|After updating MIUI interface on my Mi4i, it never connects a call in first go. Volume outcome is very poor, speaker are very poor. Even you won't hear your phone ringing if you r near a small machine or in traffic. Music player is seriously pathetic.. no search feature in player thats awful. Limited memory. Not that fast. Lags many times. Hangs. Not customizable as many devices like one plus one allow 8ts user to. For me.. Its lIke one time watch movie. (Gabbar) hype jyada stuff hai but not competitive. Truth is u get more then what you are paying.
0|5|I am using the phone for the past three weeks. At last much awaited update has come today evening to address the heating problem. Now no heating problem at all. Pros: Very good display, both front and rear camera is of good quality. nice build quality and looks of an expensive phone and light weight. Cons: Speaker volume is low. should have included two digital speaker phones. Mukund R
1|2|looks good but is fervently heating...not sure if i wld like to continue with it.. screen size camera display all are good weight is perfect
0|4|If you are looking for a cheaper phone and dont wanna spend money then this is the phone you can look after. Amazing display, decent battery life and really good camera. I could not have asked for anything more than this at this price. Heating issues were there initially but after the update, I never faced heating issues.
0|4|This Phone is Good for Price range. Sound, Video, Camera all Features is good. Some heating issues. Otherwise phone is Best.
0|5|My rate is 4.5. I am using this ph for the last 3 days. Awesome mobile. Be it display or performance. The is a lot review I had read befor buy. they said ph does't have stabilization feature. But, I don't feel any difference. Rather I & my office mates are more impressed by camera quality. When I started the phone, it there was hit issue. But after few hours, my ph is usual. No hit issue till now. I am a game lover too. The only short coming is phone doesn't have memory card slot. Otherwise, I could have give 5 -star rating. Thank you MI (:
0|5|POOR, @ Flipkart service. - phone got heated @ Charging, @Surfing @ gaming @ even when it kept in Wallet. - Blurry camera - UI - depressing - Sharpness average 5 star to Xiomi for making superb return policy.
0|3|This mobile specifications makes it mouth watery for a purchase. But after that, the user interface doesn't support easy use of this mobile. I have seldom use this mobile, looks too delicate and browsing is an effort in this. I would have rather brought a Huawei Honor 6 with that price than repent. Pros : Looks good, thin (Women!) , Battery Life, Cons: Usability, Browsing experience, Interface, Heating, and everything else.
0|3|Nice phone enough features at this price,good display and charging is good with continues mobile data it woks for one and half day. processor is good, phone works at a good speed.
0|5|I received in 2 days ............found its very good phone. Processing is very fast, camera quality is awesome. battery backup is also gud........ overall is gud. Second Xiaomi product and i am happy with this Mi 4i.
0|4|THE PHN IS GREAT IN ALL ASPECTS,,,,BUT 1 MAJOR PRBLM IS IT LAGS ALOT ,,,,GETS HANG FOR COUPLE OF SECONDS
0|4|Overall great product, display, battery, performance.. Couple of things downside as many observed are,.. Gets heated [though doesnt have impact on performance], browsing on Chrome is not as nice as nexus phones.. FM radio has pathetic UI, very hard to use and even change stations.. Otherwise I would recommend to all... super VFM
1|4|I am loving this phone There are no Heating issues ( i don't really play games ) I've also heard that using camera also heats up the phone, well it does not! very light weight and stylish phone Only drawback is: the loudspeaker voice is very low.
0|5|Firs of all thanks Flipcart team and xioami team...... What a wonderful product....... please update the phone before use i must say ur heating problem is solved by 90%....... rather than this i am surorised with the guys who wrote in reviews, that the device is worst, but it is not... it is a royal device in this range..... Thanks Xioami an flip kart for that wonderful device.. Regards Rajesh Bhatti
0|5|It has excellent look and very good built. performance is good still i could not locate the complete manual.
1|5|Writing this review as someone who's used this phone for over two weeks now. Bought this is in the first flash sale. *The phone looks good, apart from great specs *The UI is great and there's no lag with normal operations *Battery lasts well over a day. In fact lasts 1.5/2 days with data pack/WiFi almost continuously ON *The phone DOESN'T HEAT UP while on telephone conversations, however long it might be. It warms up a little though, if the camera is kept on for extensive periods of time and of course a little during charging. But then it just warms up, definitely doesn't heat up. Haven't used the phone for gaming, as I'm not a gamer. So no opinion on that part. *The camera is quite good. Both front and rear *only complaint, the freebies (screen guard and extra sIm tray) havent been delivered till date. despite registering for the same on the very next day i received my phone. Overall, given the price point, it's total value for money.
0|3|After two weeks of usage, I found that the camera is not excellent. My Zenfone-5's camera is good when compared to this. Mi4i gives good pictures only in broad day light. Even in a fully lit room, the images look dull & grainy, and from the front cam, the images look artificial. I don't know why. Also 2GB RAM in ZENFONE 5 is superior when compared to this. Because, in Mi4i, all the times it shows only 500-800 MB available. In zenfone it is over 1 GB. Heating issue is there. But it will not bother you if you kill the apps frequently. We will observe lag even while opening apps and camera. I don't know about gaming as I am not much into it. Battery is excellent. For my usage, Zenfone 5 gave some 18 hours. But Mi 4i gave 48 hours. Really Great. For light users, MIUI is not that much user friendly when compared to stock android.
0|5|Been using this phone for few days now...overall the performance is excellent. It feel premium...design is too good..sleek & light. The phone looks stunning when the screen is off. MIUI on Android L gives a lot of options to customise the themes, but is doesnot have an app drawer. 1080p display delivers excellent colors deep blacks n whites. Camera is one of the best at this price point. phone gets a bit hot when i was charging but it manageable. Havent played graphic intensive games so far...but i think this is the only problem in this phone (battery). It supports quick charging the audio jack gives excellent sound output, speakers sound is a bit low and they are at the back. They should also ship headphones along with it. Overall, excellent phone display and camera. Only battery gets a bit hot while multitasking and charging.
1|2|Phone heats up a bit on charging, using WIFI, while using 3G. Even I dont play games, phone heats up just beside Camera Area only. Battery lasts easily for full day Phone is very light weight. Handy. User Interface is Awesome. Worth for your money. Excellent Camera
0|2|Using the mobile for last one week. Though display, camera and response is ok, but the instrument gets too hot while charging and thereafter gets dead. the screen goes off and do not respond for hours. So far used only basic phone functions, no gaming, net surfing, multi tasking, etc.
0|3|+Display good +Performance fine +Good UI +Camera is good Something once should be aware of 1) On first charge the phone heated to an extent that i was scared to touch it. Post that every recharge phone hits up. In normal use i did not feel any heating but can feel the warmth (may be useful during winters ;)) 2) Cannot hear ringer clearly even on full volume...and yes the volume buttons on side are very cheap quality 3) Battery life not that great as claimed
0|4|I have rated this phone 4 star only because of one reason that this phone some times gives blank screen is some applications, Don'e know really that it is a phone issue or app issue but it happens for few apps. But I must say according to the price tag this phone is a beast with all the good features packed into a beauty!
0|4|Display and Camera is better than its rivals but interms of build quality its not that great. Looks wise its ok but the device's soft touch back panel is very cheap. Some heating issues and battery draining are main problems.
0|3|I am using Mi 4i mobile.I am not satisfied with the performance.Frequent errors are generated. Harware is good but integration with software is very bad.
0|5|Awesome phone in this range, not even a single issue in this phone. no lagging, no heating..... excellent both rear and front camera quality.. very good sound quality.. good internet speed.. I was a sony user but now using this i m fond of this phone I m suggesting you all to cover your eyes & purchase this phone... You will really love it and feel happy using this as you cant get such a latest configuration in this range... so best of luck and dont hesitate in purchasing this phone.....
0|4|I was bit worried while ordering this phone, because i have used apple, nokia lumia brands only and this is a new brand for me. But features of this phone offers are amazing at this price. - Build quality of phone is amazing. - Super cool phone design and Lightweight - Good battery life - Best MIUI6 interface (actually this is the reason i am interested to buy android phone) I seen many ppl are complaining about heating issue, i never face that. yah it will get little bit heat when in charging mode. but otherwise no such issue if may have can be fixed after software updates. The only issue i found in my phone is connectivity with WiFi, somehow i am not able to connect it, i am finding solution for that, seem that is issue with some 5.0 lollipop. i am still not sure if anybody have same issue and got tht solution plz help me to fix that. otherwise, just LOVE it, buy it without hesitation.
0|4|This phone is great for its price. The screen is amazing, the battery lasts 2 days, the ui is quick and snappy and the camera is just outstanding.
0|5|This phone is the best in the market XIOMI is the mobile leader. Best features and good looks. Overall a very good phone by xiomi
0|4|The phone is really a class apart with richness in look and features. Worth the amount. But there are some points (not though very essential) which can restrict you from buying this. - The speakers are pathetic. You cannot even talk clearly on a handsfree mode, leave apart playing songs. Very very feeble voice. - Battery of 3120 mAh is high in number. With octa core and MIUI, it only lasts 12 hours for an average user. - 2GB RAM is purely for MIUI. What you get is only 900 MB of it. So gamers check out the performance you need.
0|5|I have received the product in the best condition. But the phone doesn't have headphones. Could you please check and tell me
0|2|Got this on the flash sale day, I have to say i'm disappointed. 1. Minimal phone use causes the phone to warm up 2. No "Extreme Performance" as advertised. the transitions stutter and the phone hangs. Games that my 1yr old motoG handled with ease crash on this one with entry level frame rates. 3. Battery is pretty average, maybe the heating and stutter causing the battery drain. Updated to the latest software after wiping cache + wiping data, followed the recommended trouble shooting steps, but no improvement. Display is very good, very crisp, but that doesnt help at all when it hangs and stutters. Overall - Choppy performance and warming up. device not recommended. P.S. I can feel my thigh sweating up when I keep it in my pant pocket, hoping this would happen in winters to get some warmth :D
1|1|guys do not buy products from Flipkart, they take customer's for granted. the returns for which they say are easy and fair is a total bluff. It seems, who so ever given Mi4i more than 2 star are Flipkart Employees. Because we have not seen quality of this product more than 1 star. I have faced issue with photo Picture quality is so bad, as you can't see exact color which you clicked actually , Red color show Bright Pink, Video sound quality is like, low grade small speaker phone, you can't recognize voice of person. Its a proper Chines low grade phone. With all of the above issue, Flipkart showing so much non-adjustive attitude with customer. As if they just want to get rid of quantity of these phones. Flipkart is all fake, over televisions they say "No question ask return policy", where as we already adjusted with Filpkart showing our phone to one MI authorized center to another, use all settings provided by Flipkart support executives. If still issue is not resolved, they should stopped buffing customer, Rs.13000 is not small amount. I have bought so many products with Fliptkart just in misconception Flipkart has some professional standard but they are behaving like cheap seller. If they don't listened to regular customer then i doubt they do something for New Customer. Customer support is fight with Seller for customer support, not pressuring on customer to keep product whatever they sold. I am not Happy with Product quality and even not with Flipkart Customer support. Now on I refrain myself buying anything from FlipKart. They ruined my experience with spoiling my money. So called Loyal customer.
0|3|This phone is total value for money.Camera quality is superb and the mi user interface makes it more valuable. it has some heating issue like other phones,but the look and feel is simple uncomparable
0|3|Disappointed with sound quality. Its very low. Even after using sound booster apps you can barely hear it. Rest of the features are good.
0|5|using for 2 days...... performance is very nice heating issue is there when i opened it started heating as i opened settings an all but i saw an system update as soon as i updated the mobile heating issue was solved nearly.... i would say its nice and very slim mobile go for it...
0|5|Do not have second thoughts in buying this phone. It is a beauty for 13K. Worth every penny. The display is stunning and the MIUI (modded Android) is simply flawless. Great Hardware with unmatched Software. Xiaomi has all the potential to become a reputable brand across the globe. The only way we can make sure that such customer friendly companies last is buying their product and supporting them. You might have read reviews of Mi 4i heating issues. I was apprehensive about this, before buying the phone. But, let me tell you, the heat generated is normal for a phone and it is simply exaggerated on the internet. To be frank, the heat is less than that generated in the HTC phones. So, you can very well imagine what I am writing. I bought the Mi Band as well. It is a perfect combination. The Mi Band apart from tracking fitness related data can be used for Call and other notifications. But, the feature I liked the most is unlocking the phone with the Band. There are no words to describe the build quality of the phone. It is better than all it's competitors. To put it in simple terms, it is extraordinary.
0|1|AWFULLY LOW VOLUME OF SPEAKER, CAMERA FC WHEN CLICKING STILL WHILE RECORDING VIDEO, UNEXPECTED LAG AND HANGING WHEN 3-4 APPLICATIONS ARE USED, HEATS AT TOP END WHILE LISTENING MUSIC OR USING CAMERA. NEVER EXPECTED SUCH N LET DOWN BY XIAOMI WHOSE ALMOST ALL PRODUCTS I OWN WITHOUT ANY COMPLAIN
0|4|Pros: 1. Screen is bright and beautiful 2. Good battery life 3. Good design. Good build quality. 4. Loud earpiece 5. MIUI is very good 6. Charges pretty fast on the 2A charger provided 7. Dual 4G LTE micro sim slots 8. Pretty good camera on the back when you have good light 9. LED notification color options Cons: 1. Octa-core? Why is it so sluggish? 2. Fixed internal memory, forget apps and other media, just enough to use your phone as a phone. 3. 2GB RAM?What? Where? only 800MB RAM available 95% of the time 4. Loud speaker sucks, lacks clarity and mid-range freq response while listening to music 5. Android apps are so buggy 6. I can never hear it ring Verdict: Best Android phone in this price range. (Note: Android Phone) Much much better than the Moto (shit), because moto doesnt allow Facebook contacts. Lighter than the Moto (shit) Note: No heating issues! After 1st and now the 2nd update, absolutely no heating issues I still think the Nokia Lumia 730 is a much better phone in that price range with a reliable OS and great specs. Lumia cameras even in the sub 10k price range can kick butt of any android phone out there.
0|4|Have used this product for about a month now. Pros: - sleek, light and good build quality (most other phones with similar specs/ pricing competing with this product are much larger and bulkier) - great screen (most other phones with similar specs/ pricing competing with this product are not able to offer such a good screen) - high capacity battery (3200mah) Cons: - Slight heating issue when used for long / while charging - speaker volume a bit lower than expected - some minor but important bugs in the MIUI version of the operating system like missed calls being labeled as rejected calls, etc - slightly high SAR value
0|5|Got this phone from flash sales on May 21. Using it for 2 days.Had to opt for Mi4i as Was disappointed with Asus zenfone 2 551ml version[worth 15k]. Got a pop-up for a update of size 800 mb.updated it My impressions after 48 hours of usage 1.Display is perfect and sharp.Comes as par with Amoled Screens.Viewing angles are also good 2.Battery Backup is good.Getting ample backup after watching movies and essential browsing.[lasted for 30-36 hrs] 3.well Build.. feels strong in hands 4.Call quality is excellent . 5. Phone gets warm but nothing to be alarmed off.done rigorous usage of wifi,3g browsing and watching full hd movies...temperature remained normal from 38 to 41 celesius.[Cpuz-id software was used to check temp][Regular for smartphones] 6. Less bloatwares compared to Asus Zenfones which literally was irritating 7.Themes and other software was good.[Miui6 looks like IOS influence] 8.Rear camera stills are impressive..expect in low light,also front camera came out to be nice. 9Games I did not check as I prefer Desktop gaming than Mobile ones.. Also there is no expandable memory but Usb otg is supported. I am completely happy with phone after using it.With 13k its a sure shot phone.
0|5|The Mi4i is a beautiful phone.Theres no doubt about it . Its smooth matte finish feels premium at first but feels natural to hold and augments the experience. the very thin bezels on either side of the screen make the display look that much bigger and better....and the screen Yours eyes are treated to a rich and vibrant 5" gorgeous looking display thats better than most phones in the premium price range (....yeah im talking to you i phone) MIUI isnt the best user interface out there .If your fresh out of ios ..no android phone will make you feel more at home than MIUI. Its pretty and relatively simple to use with very little bloat ware . The only disappointment is the lack of storage . sure @12999 your getting a pretty sweet deal here, but with only 10 gb of real space to work with....... to end things i have just one think to say if your going to buy a phone with a budget of 25000 or less... buy it ...any phones under this price bracket aren't worthy of being compared to it
0|5|I was well impressed by the specs shown on flipkart and other sites, and the phone performs to its promises. The phone performed smoothly on startup and the update was also available. It is very handy and light, for its size. I am really happy with it and it's worth your money.
1|1|Phone worked fine for just 2 weeks and later on failed in its access to apps menu or call menu or any of the menus with failure message 1.Unfortunately, System launcher has stopped message 2.Battery gets very much heated during charging and data usage 3. In rare case system reboots while on call encountered 3 times Using an high end Sony Xperia I switched to MI feeling great in its features, look and price but this embarrassed me a lot. Please check the system properly once you buy it
0|5|display is very good, decent camera, supports 2g 3g &4g network but no external memory slot,OTG support, Happy with the performance of phone and excellent service of WS Retail...
0|4|Delivery: I go the delivery of the product within 3 days time since bidding. As usual flip scores high points here. Packing & looks: Packing was simple and cool. The box contains handset, which has classy looks and feel very light in hand. Installation: Installation was simple though the GPRS setting part was little complicated, had to visit the Airtel gallery to get the settings right. Performance: Inbuilt 3030 mah battery works well even through surfing, enough for a day if you are not ardent high voltage gamer. Qualcomm processor, OS - Android Lollipop along with 2 GB RAM proves ideal ally for your 3G network. Processing is fast and makes multi tasking easier. Camera: 13 MP Camera with features like HDR gives a great picture quality. HD recording is a fantastic plus. Memory: Out of the 16GB memory, what you get is 8 GB. Doesn’t have external memory card slot, though they have given OTG drive option, which is not so convenient. Display: 5 inch full HD display is the main highlight. Gives the best impression and it is difficult to find such display in other cells in same range. Sound: Sound quality is OK. The box does not carry earphones, which is kind of downer. MP3 plays reasonably well on my Phillips stereo earphones. Great package in 13k range!!
1|5|Great Phone on such low price. Great Battery Backup. Nice Camera. Really like age telling feature built with front camera. Wished it should have a memory card slot.
0|4|Delivery from flipkart was fast. Mi4i is a beautiful handset, but has few bugs. It heats in normal usage but considerable. Sometimes laggy. Battery is not as good as i wanted, but it easily last a day.
0|4|Before I start writing the review let me tell you that I have bought this phone for my dad as his birthday present. I use Nexus 5 as a daily use phone and also have Xiaomi Mi3. First of all, hats off to Flipkart on the next day delivery without even opting for it. Now coming to the point, I'll try to categorize the review based on different aspects, in addition I'll also compare 4i with Nexus 5 & Xiaomi Mi3. Design: ---------- The device has got a very sturdy and beautiful design. Back panel is made of rubbery plastic which feels great in hand. Though I found the material bit slippery. My dad even dropped the phone once :P but without any damage. The design definitely is better than Mi3 when it comes to bulkiness but not as par as nexus 5. Screen: ---------- This is the most fascinating thing about this phone. Screen looks very beautiful with dark blacks and crisp and sharp colors. Outdoor visibility is very nice and over all it's a charm to watch HD videos and playing games on it. In fact Mi4i outcasts the display of most of the devices in it's price range and I feel it's even better that Nexus 5 and Mi3. Performance & Battery : ----------------- On paper the specs are really impressive with a Snapdragon Octa core processor(1.65ghz) and 2 gigs of ram. However while switching b/w the applications and while navigating to home page, I did notice some lag. Applications themselves were running smooth, but some lag is apparent. I guess the reason could be MiUi6 which consumes a lot of Ram. The device definitely is not as snappy as Mi3 or Nexus 5 but it does the job. Web browsing is smooth and if you switch to performance mode, then it might perform better. Talking of battery, I got the device with 3030 mah battery which easily lasts a day with heavy/moderate use. The charger is capable of fast charging and battery get full charged in around 90 minutes. Camera: ----------- It's a 13 mp/ 5mp lens on the phone but personally I don't like the quality of images it takes. HDR mode compensates with some decent images under good light conditions but a lot of noise is visible for images taken in low light conditions. Front cam however is a decent performer with good images and videos making it ideal for video chats. Though Mi3 either was not having a good camera, low light noise was less. I still love my Nexus 5 for the images it takes. :D Spoiler: --------- Only 12 gigs of usable space available. Now micro sd card slot. Need to pre-register. Gets out of stock quickly. Verdict: ---------- Overall at this price range, this phone is a very good buy. This could be the ideal phone for one who is upgrading their device from a low end one. Storage should not be an issue if you know how to dump your stuffs on cloud. Thumbs up for the readers who are planning to buy it.:)
0|3|After using it for couple of days, here are few cons:- Cons: 1.There is a heat isuue, not while charging but while use for about even 1 hr. This issue is not resolved by updating as suggested by many. This is not too major. But still, it an issue. 2.You can feel a slight shock while phone is charging and you touch phone from back side near camera. 3.Though it has 2GB of RAM on paper, but available is only 1GB even when you start phone for the first time. This reduces to even 600-700MB when you install or open even 1 application. 4.Camera on paper is 13MP, but when you use it, it is not more than 8MP. 5.Camera flash intensity is too much to take. Still, phone in this budget, its a good phone. Feels good in hand.
0|4|This Mobile display excellent, Slim, good looking & Workig but not a expandable memory slot, and not support regional language,support only English & Hindi
1|4|Barring some minor MiUi quirks, the interface is surprisingly responsive. Given that I was used to Apple and Samsung phones, I was initially a bit sceptical about buying a chinese phone. Took a calculated risk which actually paid off! Xiaomi Mi4i is positioned and priced perfectly for the Indian market and will be a big hit soon! Just buy it. Period.
0|5|I am writing this review after around 2 weeks of thorough use -----It's my 1st Xiaomi phone and truly impressed I am--------- - First thing first, the overheating concern, i NEVER faced any issue yet, updated my phone twice and it looks cool & remains cool most of the time. While charging/phone call while charging/gaming its get heated alright and that every phone does, without an exception. - Excellent look and feel, UI and unmatchable resolution. - Performance of the phone (games, apps switching, multitasking) is good, heavy gamers will find a lag here and there ,its manageable though and it shouldn't be the dealbreaker. - Both front and back camera takes superb pics (though MI could have made it better, as I have seen sharper images from similar priced phones (or I am expecting too much , I am not sure :-) ) - Very light and slim (one might find it difficult to hold though, should buy a back cover i suggest) - Voice clarity is good, speakers are ok. - Network connectivity is something I am not really very happy about,it take really some time to switch between various modes (2g,3g or 4g) ,can also be due to deteriorating Airtel network in Bangalore, didn't try with other operators. - Battery life is great, with 2g network and wifi(plus normal phone calls, little bit gaming), i had used my phone continuously for 2 days without charging. With 3g...it will last a day easily. Battery gets charged real quick. I had recommended all my friends who are looking to buy a new phone.....go with this one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0|4|i bought my mi4i on 7th may and flipkart got it delivered on 11th may (as per the expected delivery provided by them.and the delivery boy could have atleast asked for some ID as it was a paid product.) 1)The phone has a great back as well as front camera.(the refocus option is great) 2)The 5 inch screen is extra sharp and the colours appear great.I played games like frontline commando, overkill 3 and N.O.V.A. the device does heat up after about 15 minutes of gaming making even the gaming stutter. 3)The mi store provides great themes and personalisation options 4)The sound quality is pretty good for a budget phone.Please bear in mind that NO HEADSET IS PROVIDED.although its not an issue.please try the mtv fashiontronix circumaural headphones (with mike).i bought them a while ago and the sound quality is great. 5)Please note that "OCTA CORE" is a pseudo octa core which means it has 4 PERFORMANCE CORES+4TIME SAVING CORES.It does make a difference when playing heavy games. 6)The battery life is pretty good and comes with a 3080mAh battery instead of the 3120mAh battery specs provided which lasts as much as 1 1/2 day with around 2-3 hours of gaming,with mobile data on all the time,which is pretty good for a budget flagship. 7)It comes with lollipop and MIUI6 out-of-the-box.and mi4 comes with kitkat 8)It does not have an IR Blaster like mi4 8)All in all its a great device in this price range and if you can't move around with a charger like me,it's worth the money.GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!
1|5|Overall good but not fast as compare to mi3. dislay and camera quality is good but slightky slow in processing. This price range its a good choice...
1|1|Overall the phone is good within the price range but within just 15 days I had faced 4 problem; 1) Battery is not getting charged over 50%. I am in touch with flipkart to find its resolution. Once the charger gets re-plugged it starts charging over 50% but not at the first instance :( 2) Ph has 2 GB ram but not so good at it.. Even moderate games like subway surfer is getting stuck sometime 3) Mi Ui interface is good but the calendar shows declined event. If you are a g-mail calendar lover, this phone is not for you 4) Mi website is offering free screen guard but when you place the order nither you would get the free screen guard nor you would get any update from Mi team.. So better to buy the screen guard with ph itself...
0|1|phone is nice , have good features BUT biggest draw back is heating issue.. phone heats up like hell. if any one like to buy a hot phone then buy mi4i.. :D
0|1|The issues with this phone are: 1. Heating problem while charging and talking for long hours. 2. Its not able to connect with mobile data when the apps try to access it. It works fine with Wifi. 3. Camera quality is ok. 4. Very low speaker volume.
0|1|Guyzz I ordered a mi 4I and after delivery when I opened the box I was completely shocked as it was not carrying my phone, and there were two pieces of cinthol soap, all my money wents into vein. Don't buy please.
1|4|Hello All, First of all, thanks to Flipkart for delivering it within 3 working days. Having said so, the packaging was not at par with flipkart's own standards. I opened the package while walking with nothing but just a key after getting the product. FYI, this is my 3rd smartphone after HTC and Lumia. Here is my review after spending 4 days with the phone. Pros: 1. Stunning design and amazing screen display. It fits perfectly in the hands because of light weight and compact design. Be careful though as back is little bit slippery. 2. Great battery performance. Will last more than a full day with normal usage. 3. No heating issues. I dont know why so many users are complaining about heating. I was also a little bit skeptical after reading the reviews here but trust me this phone gets heated just as any other smartphones do nowadays. No more. I tried playing games for half an hour, long time on wifi and data network, spent one hour on call to test the heating but it looks good. 4. No performance lags whatsoever. Although I didnt try any heavier games like Asphalt as of now 5. Awesome camera. Both front and back cameras take very good pictures. 6. Corning Concore glass - It enhances your touch experience while providing same scratch resistance same as gorilla glass 2 solution. Cons: 1. MIUI seems little bit sluggish, complex and takes heavy RAM. I would have preferred stock version. Hope, I'll get used to it. 2. Camera performance. Pictures come great but taking a picture is a pain compared to my lumia. 3. No earphones with the package. I dont know why my existing earphones ( 3.5mm sennhieser and skullcandy) are not working with the phone. To add to it, MI Piston 2 earphones are out of stock for now. 4. Only 10 GB storage available with no ext SD support. OTG supported though. 5. Loudspeaker sound is not that good. There is a high chance you will miss a call in slight noisy environment. 6. Only white colour variant available. For all people, who are on two minds after reading the reviews like me, just go for it and you won't be disappointed. :-)) I had been waiting for a phone like this since past 4 months and had explored all other possibilities e.g. - OnePlus One, Moto G 2nd gen, Honor 6, Honor 4X, Lenovo A7000, Yu Yureka, Asus Zenfone 2 and many more.
0|5|Bought it in the 22nd May Flash Sales, delivered in about 22 Hours. 5 Stars to flipkart. I read a lot of reviews before buying this phone and was worried about the heating problem. I guess the new batch has been rectified with this problem. Pros: 1. Compact: No other 5 inch phone in this segment is this compact. Very high (>72%) screen to body ratio 2. Camera: Excellent rear and front facing camera 3. Display: Display is just amazing 4. Battery: I am a moderate user, decent battery life last 1.5 days easily 5. UI: First time using MI UI, looks like it has borrowed lot of animations, look and feel from iOS, overall a good experience. Cons: 1. Build quality of back case feels a little cheap 2. Volume rocker and power buttons are not sturdy and doesn't quite fit well in their slots Conclusion: Just buy it without second thought.
1|4|Got it on 16 May.Great buy at 13k. Great features some specs almost comparable to Moto X and Samsung S5.HD display.Long Battery life +3000 Mha is more that enough for a day work.The site says dual sim ( standby ) but its dual sim active. Another added feature in the phone.Back camera is good...Auto focus is great.Front camera of 5 Megapixel is OK.No headphones in the pack and also no sim card pin , the only drawback i would say personally.Rest all iszz well. Go ahead and buy this.....great value for mney....
0|3|gud device with good feature but its got Over heated while using. can't expand memory not able to find the screen protector for the same on flipkart, MI website as well as in Market it's my suggestion to company if they are launching any new product so pls launch with required accessories like tempered glass, back cover, flip cover etc....
0|1|I got some issues with this product. Heating problem just in 10 minutes to click images. Picture quality is very bad. Zooming problem with picture. Flipkart service with this product is very bad. Need a pin to carry with you so that you can change the sim. I am getting more on this charging problem.
0|4|It doesn't lag... in one word.......healthy and wealthy... :) but would have been better if would had external memory slot....rest is awesome....
0|4|MI 4I is overall a good phone. Good Camera Quality in light but blurr images in night and low light condition. The phone got heated initially once it get updated it perform well no heating problem. 1. In flash sale flipkart has not giving option for choosing color. 2. Phone promises for 16GB memory but only offer 10 GB with no expandable memory. 3. Battery perform well last for one day. 4. Display is the best thing this phone have, crystal clear display with great resolution.
0|3|+Display Full Hd +Battery Life +Front camera +Customizable UI -Heating issues (your Ear's gonna heatup like anything and you cannot continue a call for more than 30mins) -No headphones provided by the company Verdict: Overall apart from heating issues (which is one serious issue if you use your phone extensively) rest its a great phone under 13k
0|5|pros : excellent display light weight excellent camera great price miui6 is superb cons : only 16gb
0|4|Typical Chinese .....the screen not that sensitive as claimed,operating software ? don't know how long will support. Do not justify the price......it should be in the range of 4 to 5 thousand only. 13000 rupee phone without headphone....
0|1|Totally Disgusting phone ever, don't go for this. Phone temperature goes to 46. and battery stops charging.
0|2|I have purchased this phone on first flash sale , lookwise it was nice but when i start to use this phone it become heat after 10 minutes ... get hoter after 20 minute it was the first concern and second was Battery life as per Xiaomi its battery is more than 3000 mah. but practically it is working like 800 mah just 2 hours on screen display . presently I am Using MI3 with same battery features and its working well , by the way i called to flipkart customer care at 12 may and at 13 may they agreed to replace then story became to start flipkart send me a message regarding scheduled pickup at 15 may and no any executive came receive they scheduled my pickup 16 may ,no one came 17 may, even no one came till 20 in spite of that i was was daily reminded the the pick of same day it was a mental harassment now i am waiting for new and replaced MI4I. hope new one will be fine. one more thing i would like to write in spite of above problems everything is fine in MI4i, both cameras are really good , display is fine , Processor is not very good but its like OK. its will be a good deal if above issues will get resolved .
0|5|Some' Features ( There is a lot more which you can experience on your own ) -Amazing Display -Excellent Brightness -Very Good overall performance ( incomparable with any other brand ) -Good quality Camera -Fantastic graphics overall phone is good and Value for money.
1|2|Hi guys, Everything is awesome but battery back up very low, when i play a game then bettery going down within 30-45 min, which is very bad. Otherwise good phone.
0|3|Major issue is it dissipates heat abnormally, finding it tough to handle . Flipkart claims that it is normal if CPU temp doesn't exceeds 45 deg C. CPU temp in One plus One too shoots up more than 40 deg C, but it doesn't dissipates heat like this device, which shows MI has poorly insulated it owing to the price tag. Secondly speaker volume. Very very low sound, couldn't hear the ringtone even when TV is switched on. MI wants me to sit with this phone in sound proof room to hear the ringtone ? Display, camera is all good. If the above mentioned faults can be rectified by an update, then i can consider this phone as worth buying. Can MI make me to consider like i mentioned ?
0|5|I am using this phone from last one week i am happy with this mobile. A littile bit heating is there but now days in every phone heating problem exist.Even Htc gets produce more heat then MI4I,... Recommend this phone
0|4|First of all quite surprising to receive it on Sunday. Good camera, nice crispy display, easy to handle. The only thing was heavy software update of 650 MB, with no headphones in the box.
0|4|I am writing this review specially for those who are confused about buying this product because of the mixed reviews. Initially i was a bit worried about the issues mentioned in the reviews like heating , avg rear camera and all. But i haven't faced any such issues and i have been using this device for week now. pros 1.battery is very good if not the best. (4/5) 2.rear camera shoots pretty decent clicks in daylight however in lowlight conditions picture quality is not so good (3.5/5) 3.even though it has a 5 MP front shooter but it is really commendable. (4.5/5) 4.sound quality is normal. 5.premium looks. (4.5/5) 6.no lagging issues. 7.Display is pretty sharp with good color combination. (4.5/5) cons 1.only 1 GB RAM availale. 2.gets heated on prolong use of wifi/calling but only to the normal heating level for an android phone and not as much as bragged in some reviews. 3.not sure whether sunlight display feature really works. 4.no gorrila glass protection, However they claim OGS lamination tech used for this device makes it as strong but i doubt that. 5.no accessories whatsoever even the manual guide is cheap having no detail information about the functions/features of the phone.
0|4|Quite satisfying....a bit of heating, only after gaming and prolonged downloads, which is tolerable... fast processor...screen resolution brilliant. Easy to handle and user friendly. Low internal memory can be tackled with inbuilt OTG support.battery of course drains a bit fast..24 hrs is an average duration...The screen of course picks up smudges, specially in humid Indian condition when hands are greasy due to sweats. Not heavy at all, which is a bonus. Tatas have taken a stake in the company...which is why I preferred it all the more.
1|1|Battery is very poor after 3 hours 75% battery down ,& i have 3G data plan but its not work properly so please be aware from this phone 3g plan Speed as 2g i want to return this phone but flipkart not responding. phone heating during the handset uses regular 30 minutes.
0|5|Have been using it for more than a week now. Very much impressed with the performance. Positives: -. The display is sharp & detailed -. Build quality is very nice. Despite being mostly plastic, gives a sturdy feeling -. Battery usage: Amazingly long running... the charger is surely missing me !! -. Camera quality is very good. the pictures are sharp & colors are also impressive -. Music output is really good, especially with Mi engine enabled -. MIUI6 is a good change from regular Android launchers/UI. Many nice & handy utilities. Negatives: -. Speaker sound output is low (as compared to galaxy S3, loved it) -. Both buttons (power & volume adj) are on same side. Yet to get used to it. -. Notification LED is very small Overall, a great purchase !!!
0|3|Ordered on 21st may 2015, got the phone on 22nd morning , thanks to flipkart delivery, but the product got damaged due to the damaged box, feeling unhappy for this, applied for Return, Eagerly for Return, First Impression Superb Display Good design good Camera
0|5|Over all phone is awesome. Only one software update required during video calling front camera algorithm (which enhances the picture quality according to age) is bypassed and normal video come.
0|2|Superb phone. Only short coming is heating issue. Heats up near front camera even on normal use... unbearable while you are on phone....
0|4|My Galaxy Note2 suffered a fatal fall - just when mi4i flash sales started - what a coincidence! I gave into the temptation - more so because I was tired of Samsung TouchWiz ugliness and lack of timely updates. And I did not want to spend a lot of money. Pros: You get your money's worth. The phone is smooth, and works quite well. In our new apartment, call qualities on Vodafone is far better from my Mi4i than on my wife's Moto G (1st gen). I also get 3G more often in the new apartment where as the Moto G shows 2G signal. I was worried after reading critical comments about heating issue on this phone. I have not noticed overheating at all - I suggest you OTA update your MIUI as soon as you unbox the phone. It gets warm with extended usage - but so did my Note2. But again, I am not playing CPU/GPU hogging games - just moderate phone use, mostly wifi enabled internet and the occasional cute puppy videos on youtube. I guess many users in my age bracket would have a similar profile. There are some nifty gestures which makes life pleasant on Mi4i - but it takes a while to get used to it. The display is awesome - and colours are vivid in sunlight. The Cons: I have noticed that the bottom right corner of my screen bleeds a small amount of light (go to a dark room and touch the screen buttons). I guess it is a manufacturing defect. I should technically return it back in lieu of a new perfect phone - but its too much hassle and most of the time I don't see it at all. So I am thinking of not returning the phone and living with this slight defect. The ringer volume is quite low (compared to my Note2) as a result of which I have missed a few calls. It's too gentle and quiet :) I guess its an introverted phone, which is a misfit in a world where phones can't talk loudly enough (pun intended). Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase - apart from the screen bleed and the low ringer volume. I guess it's time to visit my ENT specialist. Take care friends.
1|5|Quite happy with the phone after a week's usage. Had an early hiccup when the MIUI 6 had issue connecting to internet while on mobile data. I got an online solution - reset the APN settings to default. Simple enough to fix the issue. Camera does the job, display is good ... there is a bit of heating but nothing alarming for a uni-body & sleek phone. Feels good in hand ... Scouting for a good back cover to protect the phone now.
0|4|I am happy with the product... Sound quality and Camera quality need to be improved.. MIUI is nice and battery backup easily stands for a day
0|4|it's just awesome phone. good camera quality. good performance but some time it restart automatically. good battery but it heats a lot. it goes 42 to 47 celsius temprature while using this phone. it's a big issue i found while using it but it's nice phone.. it looks very nice and comfortable while holing it. superb color quality. in this price you'll never get this kind of quality & features.
0|5|I buy mi4i and Very Happy about it Quality.. Very Fast And Good looking Phone.. the phone is Very Strong.. I have 3 time Drop but Not any Effected Phone... Best to buy.. plz hurry
0|2|1st model i faced audio problems on call some quirky sound is coming from the speaker so replaced with new handset other that that no issues In replacement handset I faced two prolems 1. Volume and Power button is so hard to press and its finishing is not good (Which was good in the first phone) 2. Right bottom of the display below menu buttons display light is coming out of the screen.. noticable only in night in dark room...I asked for replacement Customer care guys said its KNOWN ISSUE some handsets will have this issue which was accepted by company itself .(Which is also good in the first phone) Other than that Phone is Good. Flipkart packaging and delivery also good.
0|1|My usage is very high. whenever I use the mobile phone more then 5 minutes its heating, if I continue using & it's over heating. some times i use wifi to update the apps that time also i am facing heating problem apart from this Mi4i is value for money. heating, over heating
0|5|The Phone is really amazing. But Main problem of this phone is there is no SD Card slot to increase its memory Externally. It have 16 GB internal memory in which 10 GB is available to use. You don't get earphone with its accessory.
0|5|The product is very good and quick charging mode.I am fully satisfied.It is having latest Android OS and good quality of voice while speaking on the phone.
0|5|This phone has a fantastic display and good battery life.The rear camera is good too but not as good as u expect from a 13mp camera.The front camera is good for selfies. All in all its a great phone!!! I got the phone the very next day from the date i ordered ,the packing was good and delivery was swift .Accesories include only charger no headphones
0|5|I have waiting a long time and purchased this phone. Pros : 1. Display 2. Performance 3. Camera Quality 4. Automatic contrast 5. slim, light weight, superb look and many more Cons : 1. Sound Quality and less volume 2. Not expandable memory Note : I have not experienced the Heating problem after updating the software today 5/22/2015. I recommend this phone, Go for it.
0|4|awsm phone......very handy n attractive.very good battery back up n exellent display which is 441 ppi n full hd 1920 1080. n also a very good service from flipkart.
0|3|I booked Mi4i phone on its first sale and received it in short time. The box though contained phone charger, but No Head Phones, no service or instruction manual and no free screen guards. Mi4i has awesome battery life, very good display, and very good camera. Competes best in the market today. One main issue that I am facing now, is that it looses 3G connectivity very often. Have to manually turn mobile data off and then on again to get 3G connectivity. Its very irritating. Secondly, sometimes during a call, the voice drops and you cannot hear anything, which gets back to normal after some seconds. If this continues, then, this will be a very big problem. Xiomi needs to find fix for that at the earliest.
0|5|excellent touch , good speed , stunning stability , elegent , people have mistaken seeing it as apple phone , i am overwhelmed with the price i have payee . good phone at that price
0|3|There is Heating problem which is not bearable, otherwise features are good in this phone. I requested to return the same because when i have to received the call, can not put on my ear, i have to speak on speaker .
0|4|hats off to its display very slim and light weight lags and stutters at multiple times looks stylish camera average when compared to my grand 2 whose camera was better
0|5|The Handset is great and feel Excellent in hand. The display quality is awsome and crisp. Its a top Phone for that price segment . Many fools are complainting abou xiaomi but all are fake . the phone which i got is awesome. I had also ordered a Xiaomi MI4 and its in delivery . will post the feedback of that after recieving.
0|4|if we get any problem in phone how should we return the phone and you are not providing headset .please provide headset for all the phones.
1|5|excellent smartphone in budget range, little disappointed on speaker(slow sound output), very good IPS technology, excellent front cam.
0|5|when I opened the box I haven't expected for such a beautiful model. every thing is perfect but sound is some slow
0|1|JUST GOT MY PHONE A FEW DAYS BACK . HANGING AND HEATING ISSUES. CPU TEMPERATURE HAS GONE UPTO A WHOPPING 65-67 DEGREE CELSIUS. FLIPKART HAS RAISED ITS HANDS AND SAID THAT THEY ARE HELPLESS AND THEY HAVE FORCIBLY CLOSED MY COMPLAINT WITHOUT RESOLUTION. NEVER EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AND NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART. TESTIMONIALS CAN BE HAD @ 09953141516. I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS PRODUCT AND FLIPKART "ZERO" BUT THAT SCALE IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT ITS A BIG ZERO.
1|1|Please don't get mi 4i product because i am already perched and facing many problem like hanging problem while installing many application . another one while i am playing 30MB game that's generate heating problem after 5 min. and after that you can not hold on your hand also while playing 30MB games it's hanging problem issue are occurred . Battery Problem also are main issue. after 30 min 50% battery gone out . So If you want to choose that product just think about it. Flipkart also doesn't Support .
0|4|The first thing I would like to say, I'm very happy with my MI4I after spending more than 2 weeks. I have not faced any so called heating issue after intensive gaming and browsing through internet. Display quality might be the best feature of it. The improvements which it needed: The sound output(for both external speaker and heaphones) could be better. MIUI is gorgeous to look, to feel but when using the phone intensively; it makes the phone to lag. It lags even with its octa core and 2 GB RAM(Though not everytime). If you want to buy this phone, just do it, you don't need to think about harsh reviews cause other than the improvements I mentioned here, the phone is exceptional in every other cases.
0|3|Push notification not working. Checked with the Mi Service Centre, they confirmed that this is known issue and would be solved only on next update.
0|4|I have bought this product on 14th May, and it got delivered on 16th May in Trichy. The delivery is really fast, keep up the good job flipkart :-) Mi 4i: Nice phone under 13k, good build quality, except that back cover feels like a cheap phone. I suggest blindly go for it.... Performance: Lighting fast multitasking and no lag, not felt any heating issues during normal operation Excellent display with vibrant colors touch is very smooth, could recognize very slight touches as well Pros: Camera is too good, and its better than the one present in iPhone 5s & One plus one MIUI6 feels very good, and more user friendly Awesome screen resolution with vibrant colours, feels like a samsung S5 display Good build quality Audio quality is good Cons: Slight heating issue when playing games Rear plastic feels very cheap, and makes the overall looks to be less attractive. Conclusion: Just go for it!
0|5|After using Mi 4i for 4 days, I can say that it is the best phone in this price. Flipkart service is excellent, as always. Before putting my SIM card in, I updated the MIUI as it is available. And believe me, heating issue has been resolved, well almost. Touch sensitivity is good, battery backup is also good, MIUI experience...Great. The only thing disappointed me is that the loudspeaker volume. It is not low but also not loud compare to even Redmi1S. I hope and guess Miui team will solve the issue in future updates. Overall Go for it.
0|4|Display was Amezing. Clear brighter and shar. Baattery Power was awsome. Long Life Battery Want to purchase again. No hitting.
0|1|Most wierd sound that i have ever heard in any phone.Heating issue while talking to anyone. Battery charging is very slow.Phone is lagging and very slow while opening applications.
0|5|I recommendate to all who think to buy cell up to 12-15k Rs it's batter than Samsung and really nice in design and features. Money worth.
0|5|it is a perfect buy the display is awesome the phone is so light and the front cam is brilliant ... its have some heating issue but after the update the heating is lower and ram consumption is good MIUI is just awesome battery performance is good ...
1|4|The phone is overall good but does'nt seems like an octa core processor. Only 1GB of RAM available out of 2GB.Althoug its performance is good and nice built quality.
1|1|It Is Very Hang While We Disconnect From Charger. Performance Also Not As Per Expectation. Camera Not Work Properly
0|5|GREAT MOBILE ,OTHER THAN HEATING UP, CAMERA IS NICE ,UI IS BEST , ONLY TO CONNECT USB IS TIRYING, HONOR 4X IS ALSO GOOD AS COMPARED AND HONOR 6 IS BEST COMPARE TO MI4I
0|4|In one line i can say value of money phone. great picture resolution sound quality is good. but if xiomi also give the accessories even one screen guard or headset that makes it perfect package.
0|4|I recently bought this phone, fantastic display, overall quality pretty good, though some scope for improvement. 1-Volume and On & Off keys quality is very bad, these are sharp, do not give you a great feel of a phone with such a price tag, seems to be loosely placed on the body. Have submitted this feedback to the Mi.com as well. 2-The middle home key does not give you the option to switch on the device, you will have to use on & off key every time you have to use the phone. Bit of disappointment as this should have been there. 3-Option for selecting photographs for deletion is not there when you are in the gallery section, it either lets you select all or you have to select each snap 1 by 1 to delete. Quite primitive when you look at the high end smart phone category. 4- Speaker of the phone was really a disappointment, on full volume, it does not really give you great sound output. Company should clearly update on the brochure / specs of the phone that these are not really the loud speakers as company claims. 5- Overall phone performance is good, though SD card option should be added like Redmi-2 and also cloud storage should be around 10 GB instead of 5 GB being offered by mi.com, specially when you do not have SD card option available. 6- Simple operations also eat up the RAM quickly, even 2 GB seems less, MIUI 6, I guess is not supporting optimum usage of RAM.
1|4|Received this product on 12th May. Everything is OK except sound which a bit slow, but manageable. I was frightened when I found from review that the phone is heating while use. This is totally false or at-least I am not feeling like that. Even Mi authority after purchase, offered free Screen Glass cover which is in transit now. Worth of price.
0|5|This is the finest phones I ever had! With world class battery stand by, the phone provides super quality display, colour balance and crispy sharp images. You will find one of the best rear and front camera with impressive aperture and shutter speed. Now, what can you expect more out of a smartphone under 15000! Heating is something very very negligible as I'm personally using this phone for a long time. I suggest for good gaming experience you can go for well configured PC's or Xbox but not on smartphones. We as users should always judge a product basis the need to have factors rather nice to have factors (which are never ending).
0|4|Missed call notification not showing many times, apps crashing sometimes, Many other UI bugs as well. Also Xiaomi promising and not delivering the freebie items for mi4i. But over all a value for money phone with awesome display,performance and camera. Does have the heating issue though.
0|4|1. Phone Heats a lot. 2. External speaker volume is low. 3. Phone Without Headphones :( UI is Good.and not very happy but only satisfied with it.
0|4|prons 1. good battery. 2. good camera only day light. 3. excellent screen. 4. heating issue solved after then update. cons. 1. only 650 mb ram remaining without use any application. 2. spot and noise in night in camera and pic are good in phone but when transfer in my pc its convert in low quality. 3. memory only 9GB remain after software update. 4.speaker sound quality are very bad even you update receive. So this phone are not excellent but good in this price.
0|4|It is a good phone as per the cost. UI is too good. Mobile design is superb, battery is good. No question on camera. So, overall it is an excellent smart phone.
0|5|This Phone is awesome. I liked the camera Clarity and the battery backup. Previousliy i used to charge my samsung every 5 hours when all time data is switched on. But now am charging MI4i after 24hrs with full time data on. Super phone. I recommend this for my firends and i have bought 3 more for my firends and relatives.
0|5|This is the best smart phone at this price, rather in all price range.I am using it for last 8 days and found no issues whatsoever...Camera superb, smooth operation, with heavy use the battery last for one full day.
0|4|Really shocked to see mi in my hands.... Hey guys its true that its a chienese manufracturer but trust me i m using..... No complaints at all guys.... Rocking best performance and camera and no heating issues too guys.... The heating news were rumor by haters.... Love mi.... Compared with my samsung galaxy s6 but really i do like mi4 more..... The ui is also a great task to play with.... Happy with u mi.
0|3|Pros: Good Display Slim design Cons: Heating: Phone have heating issue. Unless you make calls/Browsing etc.. battery will have backup. :) After installing regular using applications left RAM will be 100-200MB Bug in Exchange active sync cause block for Enterprise users. Collection of pre installed bloatwares I could see 1000+ bugs in MIUI repo active and not fixed [Priority 0 bugs included.]
0|4|The best in class screen Amazing Camera Great sturdy body Decent Battery Back-up Yes! It is an amazing phone in terms of hardware.However, the Mi UI kinda destroys the good things about it Consumes around 50-60% of RAM most of the times and hence ruins the performance over-all The security App in the Mi-UI is another weird App where it blocks many Apps and you've to manually sort it later If you're not a hardcore gamer, i will recommend you this phone.
1|4|I bought phone in Sale on 7th May.The phone piece was defected.I switched it on and started checking features, while I was checking youtube all of sudden display gone off, then it never displayed anything. Flipkart expert told me troubleshooting methods to charge and reboot etc but that did not work. Finally the phone got replaced by Flipkart. New phone is good.Display quality of phone is superb, you will love it.Touch is smooth. Software UI and phone design is very good.Phone build is perfect and it is very light weight phone.It feels smooth using the phone. But disappointing thing is heating.After half an hour of browsing and using apps, upper part of phone gets heated; after that you can not touch phone to ear if there is any phone call.It gets heated only in upper part not in the lower half. Sound of phone is low.Volume keys and power button edges are sharp. Camera quality is good. Video quality very good and photo quality good. One BUG in the phone I noticed, if camera flash is on and you press back button come to desktop out of camera app but flash does not get off. All these things are minor, only major irritating issue is heating in this phone, rest everything is good. If there was no heating then I would rate 5 of 5 this phone.
1|1|there is only one best xiaomi phone and it is Mi3.................................................................................................................................................................
0|4|Cons: - No extendable memory - Rear camera is good but not exceptional. - MIUI 6 - will not let you feel that you are using Android L Rest every thing is just great. I am using this device for more than 2 weeks, no heating problem at all. Pros - Good Selfie Camera, - Good Battery backup (better than asus zenfone 2) - Great screen - Very hand (I feel 5" screen size is idle) - Good build quality If you have a budget under 15K.. go for it. Better than ASUS Zenfone 2. 551ML
0|1|I was bought a phone with full of expectations on first sale itself 1. 1st time I received the product with led light leakage problem from side of the screen and over heating issue phone reaches 47 degree with in 10min of game play, returned 2. 2nd time I received the product with dead pixel on display, this time over heating have some improvements it reaches 52 degree within 10 min of game play, again returned now refund was approved, totally disappointed with mi4i looking to go for honor 6 with exchange of my old phone
0|1|very less battery back up it requires daily 5 to 6 times charging and also sound not good ,FM also not working its giving full noise .
1|1|This phone looking good but have technical problems. 3G internet not working properly.With 3G some application not working like google play store, website also not working getting mobile errors. with wifi working fine. I purchased for mobile internet. Battery is poor performance when using internet. Even using phone application also battery poor performance. when talking on phone or using any application getting too much heat. I am not recommend this phone.
0|4|I am satisfied with Mi 4i. Build quality is excellent, excellent display, good performance, good camera, no lags & excellent battery backup. It heats up a bit while using the camera & playing games but that's not a big problem, heat is easily bearable.
1|5|THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT. VALUE FOR WHAT WE SPEND.... camera,user interface,sound quality,build quality,speed,graphics ALL ARE PERFECT.... PLEASE CLOSE UR EYES AND BUY THIS PHONE. IT IS COMPARABLE WITH IPHONE 6.....
1|2|I ordered this phone with full excitement and enthusiasm. It is my first order for a mobile phone online. No need to tell about specifications as already mentioned on website. I have this phone with me since three days. The phone is good but if you are in need to use 3G internet network then search any other phone. You need to reboot your phone every time for using 3G internet. After each reboot, phone will respond for 3G internet network for few minutes (around 5 minute) then again you have to reboot your phone. However, if you shift setting for 2G internet (slow one) network then phone will respond continuously. (one of the requirement for me).. Sound: The loudness of speakers is low and not clear. It is not properly audible as well as not clear for music at loudspeaker mode (one of the requirement for me). Heating: After updating software, the heating is less (but present) specially during charging, I am not game addicted so i can't say about it. Screen: It is nice and appreciable. Camera: Ok ok, as color contrast is not much good. Overall, i would say that I have wasted my number of days in waiting to purchase this phone and then updating and for getting used to it. A lot of time have been wasted to check 3G network on this phone but as i said, it does not support 3G network. (It is a 4G mobile and the best thing is, 4G network is not available in India. Why companies are launching 4G mobiles in India).
0|4|good batter backup for normal use 1 and half day cam quality is good but low voice from speaker output picture clarity is so good
1|4|Phone is good and is value for money but it heats regularly.
0|5|I ordered the mobile and got it in two days as the normal delivery. The delivery of the product is nice. This phone got all the features that are to be accommodate for the price. I really like the camera and both are working good. The processor speed is good and is working very fine for me. I used to play games in this and found not much heat. Graphical interface of MIUI is very good and is really awsome. But some of the themes are having the defects. Over all it is a good product to buy. :)
0|4|UI-5/5 battery - 5/5 performance - 5/5 camera - 5/5 setting options are great Samsung + apple double treat. charging very quickly not like apple. speaker is bit low but very classy ... just go for it.. I'll update if I face any issues.
0|5|A very good phone at this price. With decent camera and display. One disadvantage is that it has no memory card slot you will have to purchase a otg cable if you want to connect pendrive or memory card.
0|3|I purchased Mi4i a week back and writing this review. I was using iPhone 5s since last one year and before that Samsung Galaxy S2 and now Mi4i. Overall device is good. - Good UI (MiUi 6) - Good features(Specially when coming back from iPhone 5s) - Touch response is good - Good camera result front and rear both - MiUi messages function(same as iMessage) - Good battery back up (almost 10 hours) with 3G on and regular usage of apps and call Cons are : - Most important heating issue after 20 mins of constant use device. - Speakers volume is quite low. - Device lags some time (i have installed more than 70 apps , so think that is quite okay.) - 2GB ram is not enough for hardcore smartphone users - Device doesn't have extended memory card slot. Overall needs to improve on some parts but good with lots of feature in this price range. Would recommend to an average smartphone user. I will update review based on further usage.
0|5|Excellent phone, packed with many advance features. Flipkart service was fast, packing was also nice.
0|4|Hi I was using windows phone earlier, then i bought MI4i from Flipkart. Delivery was fine, packing was impressive. Now for review below are the comments:- 1. Display :- Awesome, very bright. Sunlight readability is good. 2. GUI :- MIUI is petty good thing to try, very much customized, even one can control data usage per app and permissions for apps can be changed at any time. 3. Battery:- quite impressive. At the end of the day with full day 3G internet and few games it will show around 20-25% battery remaining. 4. Touch and keys:- Response is fast. 5. Camera :- Average performance by primary camera though it is 13MP. Front camera adds auto brightness in your pictures, but pic quality is average. 6. Weight :- Light in weight, which makes is quite handy. 7. Value for money :- purely a value for money phone. and back of the phone does not look cheap. 8. No SD Card slot:- a fully functional phone with nominal apps will give 9 GB of free space only for music and files etc.
0|4|I like this phone. As a person who is using Windows phone for the past couple of years, I truly say this phone is superb.
0|5|True Value for money phone.... Mi has done it again by launching its masterpiece 4i. No lagging Problem....smooth interface... highly customizable options...
0|5|Its a awesome mobile at this price. just a problem with inbox charger nd cable.:(... not charging fast with that charger. u need to buy another good charger. overall a good phone.. great front camera. i like that age detector. :D
0|5|Used this phone since past few days. Great features.. Before purchasing phone read reviews of flipkart regarding heating issue and low quality speakers, but after using it i DIDNT FIND SUCH ISSUES. (Though i dont play games but i use internet ) Some heating is normal just like my previous sony xperia S & samsung grand 2 phones while speakers are better then xperia. Camera quality and battery life of MI4i - better then my previous xperia and samsung. Memory is 16 gb but that is sufficient for me.. Overall better then my previous phones - sony and samsung that are double the cost of MI4i.
0|4|Beautiful Design, Great Specifications specially the camera.. it is just amazing.. even in dark situations it produces very clear images.. Just 2 Problems.. Heating issue and 16GB Memory bt we do have n OTG as a solution
1|5|Battery Backup Very Slow over all good phone, not expandable memory,Dassu screen display but one major problem gorilla glass not built in phone
0|5|Nice mobile for the price, thumbs up for display clarity, battery, camera. missing external memory slot is drawback.
1|4|i have recently purchased the Mi4i in the second sale. the device is extremely good to use and hold. light weight and looks premium. display and camera are outstanding. cons - The phone has a light bleed issue below the touch buttons which can be seen in a dark room. i am getting a replacement done that should hopefully fix, lot of other people reported this issue in the first sale. Heating has been a concern but is it general to moderate heat similar to other devices. the fast charge option does heat up the phone but that is expected.while using the device in a/c environment you hardly notice any heating. Storage as expected in a 16gb version - you get 9.5gb post the updates, need to use OTG usb drive for my music and videos as you are left with balancing app installation and free space on the device.
1|4|I have used this phone for a week now.There are absolutely no heating issues. Please update the phone before using it.Update is about 850MB. Now the Pros and cons. CONS 1. The loudspeaker is awfully slow. Its difficult to hear the Google maps directions if you are in a car even at full volume. You will definitely miss a few calls. 2. MIUI although looks very polished, its a little heavy. The phone doesnt lag at all but we wouldnt call it blazing fast. 3. No headphones along with the Phone. 4. Camera is average. 5. No microsd slot. User available memory is 10GB. Just like the iphone:) PROS 1. Display. beautiful 5 inch display. good sunlight legibility. 2. Battery. Many reviews say battery is poor. I switch off GPS, Mobile data and wifi when not required. I am a heavy user otherwise. Battery lasts full 1 and half day with some juice still left. 3. You can delete even apps like Google play and Google stand if you don't require them.There are two options for keyboards apart from Google. get rid of them. they consume battery. Swift key and Flexy. 4. less bloat ware compared to my S4. 5. Design is slim and elegant. the matt finish gives a feel of lumia devices. not plasticky at all. 6. No issues with mobile reception or data connection.
0|4|Product is really good, high performance with very good Camera and display quality. Only thing is that it does not provide expandable memory facility which i didn't observe before buying it. Overall very nice product. I'll rate it 4 but only for the product but not for flipkart's delivery service. This time I am not happy with the delivery service, because, delivery was already delayed for 2 days and moreover i had to go to the courier center and receive my product from there only
0|5|it's an awesome phone, though it has some heating issues which is the only con i faced. other than that it has amazing display plus gr8 camera both front and rear.
1|4|1) voice from speaker is quite low but i expect an update soon to improve it. 2) voice from microphone appears to be muffled and not appreciable at other end when kept at a little angle away from mouth . (what i observed) 3) ofcourse heating is an issue but it is hyped more than it actually is. 4) fast charging is just a bluff. 5)............ still testing it.
0|3|I got jst two days before but its has heating issue from the first day while using camera , charging , surfing internet via wifi or mobile data and also while talking via voice call also ... Looks is good but heating is a bigger issue so i have emailed to flipkart to return it asap.
0|5|Fantastic product. I have been using Iphone 4S and this product beats Iphone heads down. I have been loving every moments of its use but unfortunately my phone got stolen on 17th May. It is locked so whoever stole it wont be able to use it easily. Any way I have registered for the sale on 21st and hope I will get another of this wonderful phone this time too
0|1|As per Filpcart services concern is good at last they have refunded me the money for defective Mi 4i handset/s. But not at all happy with mi 4i, In 1 month I had received 3 nos. of hand set from filpcart & all 3 hand set had a same issue (1) hand set get heated up not only whn u r charging / playing game, even if u speak for 5 min. is heats up like u r standing in a 40% direct sun. (2) The handset get hanged up for which u can't do any thing unless the battery get drain out. (3) Can't able to send SMS, even service center was not able rectify the issue. (4) Display keep on fading every know & than. I had visited the service center at Borivali, Mumbai, Maharashtra for 4 times in a month to resolve my above issue & I was shocked to see 6 out of 10 client were having issue with Xaomi Mi hand set which were less than 6 month old.
0|5|Great Product with price offered, love to have this phone, slim product with good speed, ...........
0|4|Plus :- 1. Slim profile 2. Good build quality 3. Beautiful Screen (Smooth touch, High contrast, correct white balance, black actually looks black and white looks white, colors look pretty good. Looks as beautiful as like an Apple retina display) 4. Good camera for price (High details, if you use focus properly you can get Bokeh effect, two tone flash helps keep the colors natural in low light, front camera is also decent enough ) 5. Long Battery life (with light usage on 3g and WIFI without games around 2 days easily, with games and heavy usage will last at least a day). Minus :- 1. No SD card slot (I would not have mind paying extra 1000 bucks for 32 GB device or SD card option should have been there) 2. Only white color available at the moment, I wanted to buy the black version. Should have been launched with more colors. MIUI is a both plus and minus depending on preference, It is highly customizable but even though running on Lollipop does not have all lollipop features.
1|4|all the features are greate at this price only issue with the heating problem ..but now a days all high performance phones have common issue i has been using this phone since 4 days.. mi gives this phone a very profession touch.. really a value of money at this price
0|4|Overall, value for money, premium look, great quality photos, excellent display. We'll feel heat after using for some time (30 min) but it might be common in thin phones. Excellent processing speed, never felt to install some optimization software. Lack of memory card may give trouble for heavy data usage people otherwise available 13GB should be fine (3GB used for OS and other apps) Nice packing, and as usual great delivery service by flipkart. People who love to have a premium look phone below 15K can happily go for this.
0|3|Good light phone.Without earphones was very disappointing. Not started using it. Excellent delivery timing by Flipkart.
0|3|All I would say phone is OK but not the best Cant be connect to window xp without having Mi PC suite even does not support as mass storage Better to go for redmi Note 4g
0|5|I got this mobile 2 days back Value for money, MI4i was selling good products.heating problem was solved by after updating 800mb thanks to mi4i. Its selfless was very good. it seems to like apple. Friends comparing to my grand2 MI4i was too good. Thanks to flipkart and thanks to MI4i team ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|4|Best Phone to buy in the price range. It’s just a good one, which I got yesterday. It is way better then my old Nexus 4.
0|5|Mi 4i is going to give a tough competition to other mobile brands, the UI is refreshing and better than the stock android or the ones on other customized UI's
0|5|Best phone you can get in 13K! Don't worry about the heating issue at all! I have a nexus 5 and the same thing happens when I use 3G. The more powerful the processor, the more heat it generates.
0|5|hi users, if u wanna buy this phone don't see the others review. blindly buy this phone. i guarantee & challenge you all this one is the best of the best mobile from Xiaomi. & too much thanks to WS Retail i booked my phone on 14/5 & recieved in two days i got my phone delivered to me on 16/5. The best thing / feature of this phone is. 1) its sure it heats first time but after updating it it never heats. 2) process is 100% two times better than any other phones. 3) 2GB ram works like a rocket. 4) 13MP DSLR camera is SUPERPERFECT HD Lens. you can keep torch on & capture Clicks.dual flashlight brightens & makes clear HD clicks of your images at night. 5) its a lovely light weight-slim mobile. 6) if your display brightness is 0 (zero) then also in sunlight you can use device without any problem. 7) it has 16GB internal memory no ext memory. so 6GB system ROM uses & left 10GB for user. i think 10GB for me it much enough. 8) sound system is much good its effect is like DoblyDigital while playing/hearing music or watching videos. lets the user say that sound is at average quality. but the fact i say is sound must be at that level only. if you hear too loud with support of Earbuds then loud sound effect affects your earholes & skin too. so my review for you all is don't worry about this phone by reading other users review. blindly buy this phone for you.
0|5|Didnt face any issue after using it for 2 weeks...No heating. Super fast charging. front camera is awesome in low light but rear camera will disappoint in low light. Still pretty awesome in day light. Touch and sharp interface is awesome can rate 4.5/5
1|4|Really a good phone. GOOD: 01. Design, Look 02. Camera 03. Display 04. Really feels good BAD: 01. Heat
0|5|1) I'm using this product around 2 weeks and its very good in terms of display, touch & less weight. 2) Pros - Display quality Supports OTG Phone features like tweaks in camera(beautify), calls( Automatic recording for all the calls) 3) Cons - No external memory Overall good phone who looks to buy as budget phones below 15k...
1|4|Overall product is good but it gets heated up while gaming. Heating issue is not there for normal use. Sometimes slows down during gaming. Limitation of 16GB internal memory is there. Rest it is Rocking Xiaomi is not providing screen guard and headphone with this.
1|2|Received phone in first sale.....Extremely well built and beautiful phone. But experienced frequent hanging between applications, abrupt shutdown of applications and complete shutdown of phone on 5 occasions during use of just 5 days. The phone also completely hanged on 2 occasions, even didn't respond when charger was connected and started only once the battery got completely drained off. Only plus point is built quality, finish and Battery which is relatively good. Was using Yureka Yu for 2 months before this phone. But never found any problem with the phone...Phone gave great results with no lag whatsoever. But had changed the phone because Yureka comes with 5.5' screen and is little bigger in shape. Guys if you can manage with bigger screen phones, I advise Yureka Yu. Its beautiful, has great response and is cheap also.
0|5|Nice product, The hardware is too good . Very smooth , good for money Nice camera,look -Amazing The phone is awesome, have all the facilities we need. Nice sleek phone, weightless. Cons-No MMC slot No Headphone No User manual
1|2|Its bad experience. I used this mobile for 2 days and facing lot of issues. Over heating and call quality is not good.If you browse for some time, its heating like anything and if you call at that time, lot of call drops are there. Please take action on this
0|5|PROS : good display good form factor great camera great battery no lag CONS: plastic body feels weak chrome key edges could have been smoother additional memory slot option should have been included
0|4|SLIM YET POWERFUL GOOD FEATURES NO HEATING ISSUES SO FAR NICE CAMERA GOOD USER INTERFACE GOOD HANDLING BATTERY LIFE IS AWESOME SPEAKERS ARE BIT SLOW GO FOR IT ITS GOOD IN THIS BUDGET
1|5|According to the pricing the phone is best in specs and performance, Screen is just awesome and Battery is working flawless and longtime. Sometimes on heavy usage Heating issue is the problem, but negligible
0|5|I bought this phone and received it on Monday 11 may and now i use this phone but there is some problem occurs which is "popup window"when i use the phone suddenly an popup window open and stop my application this effect bad to my phone.if possible so please solve this problem.do you have any updates for it.overall phone is awesome and front camera is so good and image quality is very very good its good for Selfie. and battery backup also good.if there is also a slot for external memory it makes phone outstanding.but no problem over all my phone is awesome.i m happy with it....till now...
0|4|Its a pretty nice mobile with grt specs at the price tag it has....hope the latest (6.5.4)OTA update does resolve the heating issues. Worth piece to use it.
0|5|Does this phone overheat a little? YES Is MIUI a memory hog? YES Is the music volume 'low' on external speaker? YES Are their any minor bugs yet to be fixed? YES Is this still the best phone to buy for the price segment right now? HELL YES. Stunning display, awesome camera(s), nice battery backup, good performance, excellent build quality and beautiful design makes it a worthy heir.
0|5|Have been using this phone about a week Pros: 1: Best screen around 2: 2 Day battery back up with normal use 3: Great Form Factor 4: Latest hardware Cons: 1: Only white colour available No heating problem as suggested by some of the users...go for it
1|4|The product is very good for this price, it is a killing. good camera's, good processor etc. etc. only issue that i have faced is that excessive use of the mobile for playing games heats up the device. I think they need to fix this at the earliest.
0|5|If anyone buy this pls follow these instruction after recieving phone,, connect to wifi and update the MIUI software (806mb) after updation do full factory reset. after reboot update google play services. thats all Now Mi4i has reduced 80% of heat. i prefer 2g signals for more efficient battery life than 3g If not following these instructions with out update, then ph temperature will be very higher and battery also drains fast.
0|2|It is getting hot while we play games even in A.C. So if u love gaming do not buy it. And battery is non removable so it get stucked you can do nothing much than restating your device.
0|5|Phone has yes heating issues,but please update your phone software in MiUi after phone work very smoothly and heating no longer in phone...it will work try it.
0|3|Hello, I have been using BlackBerry from last 4 years, so it was a difficult decision to switch to Android. Flipkart delivers this phone in 4 straight days. When unboxing, the phone feels great and it doesn't look like a 12999/- phone. Built quality is good for its price. Thin and sturdy. So during installation and setup, the phone started heating unbearably and it was difficult to hold it or hear it. I even posted my rage to Mi guys on twitter. But hey, there's a 800 MB update with it. Before installing any other app, give you phone that update and eventually heating problem will be resolved. I got this phone 4 days back so yet to explore a lot of things. I quickly state the pros and cons of this phone Pros 1. Great built quality 2. Awesome camera. 3. Good 1 day battery on 3G network 4. Great Mi support ( these people hear you very carefully) 5. This company has the potential to be next Apple 6. Great touch Cons 1. Sound (Speakers on back!! What have they done?) I bet you can't hear your phone ringing in streets. 2. Lag, I have seen some applications do lag. 3. 16 GB only. Big drawback. You actually get around 9 GB only 4. No headphones with the box. 5. Available only in white color Verdict: Its a good phone in its price range. It surely have some lags which I believe Xiaomi will come over. Its major draw backs are its storage and sound. People will love it for its built quality and touch screen. A good phone for females. Good Luck !!
1|2|Pros 1. Camera is very good. Clear pictures. 2. Video recording is great Full HD 3. Very light in weight 3. Display screen is excellent. Bright with right contrast Con 1. Even after installing wireless printer plugin i can't take prints. MIUI stops it. 2. App association with file extensions overruled by MIUI. even if i want to open a file with a specific app like Acrobat reader it will not by default. 3. Download speed is very very bad. I used by old MotoG to download an app on wifi (8mbpd line) and it took 23 sec. But with Mi4i it took 40sec. V slow 4. Unable to download big apps from PlayStore on 3G network (only works on wifi). Keeps giving error "Server Error" 5. Heating is an issue.
0|4|I am using this phone for 3 weeks and realy I am Satisfied with this product instead of one thing That is it doesn't have external storage if it has then Its a really superb phone. Few peoples are getting heating problem but I haven't got yet. I played very Huge games on my Phone nut it runs very smoothly and no heating problem I faced yet. Camera Quality is really Good.
0|4|i m using this for 7 days so far i am not facing any problem with this phone, every thing is good, awesome camera both front and back i dont think heating issue with this phone while charging the phone is little bit a heat otherwise ok awesome phone u can go for mi4i instead of yureka lenovo etc
0|4|i am used this for 3 days.....this review from 3 days exprience...... first pros:- 1. mobile look is unbelievable.....super....... 2. display,speed also well 3. camera omg chanceless....front and back superp quality in day and night....... 4. miui is also good......with lot of option....automatic call recorder is one of that. i like it... 5. Display quality awesome.... now some cons:- 1. little heat issue 2. battery should be high.. i am use 1 hour whatsapp and facebook battery reduced 20%....
1|2|The Mobile has very good user interface, however it's not a reliable phone. I faced several issues that include Battery not getting charged, network problem, screen lock doesn't work. Speakers are average, you can't compare with Samsung or iphone.
0|3|Was surprise to see that product of Rs 13K does not offer Headphone. Average Battery life. When net is on Battery is consumed faster.
1|4|I used 3 days and writing this Review Pros 1) Good Build 2) Smooth UI 3) No heating issue on standard mode 4) Good Battery Cons 1) A very little lag (we can ignore) 2) No earphones 3) While talking over phones, it gets somewhaat heat
1|2|1st problem - Heating It can be ignored by me as i don't play much games and if xiaomi and flipkart say that if battery temperature goes upto 50, its fine, then absolutely fine 2nd problem - Volume calls come i dont come to know. Vibration not strong enough. Now new problem, when i play the music volume too low. switch on the phone, its fine. Use it for some time. it's too low at times Another thing. u play music at highest volume, say 15 turn it to 8 and place phone on ur ears to hear the sound. Pictures in dark r too bad. if u click with flash or torch on, yellow images Pros - Sunlight display and quick charging Nice pictures in bright day light
0|5|Phone is really good....(used for 4 days) no heating problem Camera is amazing(front and back) multitasking without any problem few apps already installed No head phones :( not expandable memory but 12GB usable ...not a problem screen resolution is good Over all for Rs.12999... its worth.
0|4|I bought my Xiomi mi4i before a week and everything is good. Perfect design, light weight, good performance with gaming, videos. And when come to camera, clarity is very good especially the front cam, it works fine,with some defects. It came with MIUI V5 and i updated to MIUI V6,after MIUI 6 update, the front camera captures only the mirror image and not the actual image. After applying manual settings, it doesn't work, may be a problem with update, need to check.., if you are going to use the front cam for video call, the person chating with you can only see your mirror image. And little defects like overheating even for 5 minutes browsing and battery wont last a day if you browse and chat continuously. If you are going to buy MI4I, please check with front cam, other than this the phone is pretty good and awesome, its like using a iPhone at low price :) If its not for front camera and overheating i would give 5 star for this. Perfect phone for best price.
1|4|Overall the Phone"s A Beast ..Good Looks ,Nyc body desgn ,good camera , a big battery and a solid full hd screen... the only thing whch i didn"t like is that the audio output is a bit low
1|5|Bang for the buck. Does not get heated up for day-to-day usage. When playing high end games for long it does get heated up a little. In a nutshell awesome phone. loving it.
0|4|Its is a best phone in this price range. I bought it from Flipkart and got the phone within two days. The best plus of the phone is its camera. It is having an amazing camera special the front camera. The only negative point is storage capacity as you cannot put external SD card.
0|4|I got this phone from the very first sale, so i am writing this review after considerable usage... To start with the phone has delivered to what i expected on most of the counts. The display is top notch and the phone feels premium as soon as the screen turns on. The cameras are impressive considering the price range, may not be as good as those on a top notch samsung but handsomely beats most of the phone in its price range. The touch is good and the toggle between screens is smooth. I tried a couple of 3D games and the graphics and the response seems perfect. Yes the phone heats up on with the clock ticking but which phone doesn't? Initially the phone used to heat up even on normal usage but after the 800MB Update of the MIUI this problem has been completely taken care of. When one looks at the number of 3000 mAh on the Battery front you probably end up expecting too much... the battery life is good for a day(14-16 hrs) of medium use with data ON for the whole time. The overall built is strong enough, i have manage to drop the phone twice till now, no marks/scratches yet ;) Given how slim the phone is one gets the feeling, is the screen strong enough but so far so good, i have my fingers crossed on this one. The Network reception is good, call quality is also good. The 3.5mm jack gives out enough detailing on a good quality headphone and i find it impressive as compared to other phone at this price. Finally the BUT(T)... at the bottom on the back side you have the loud speaker and this is probably the only count on which the phone really disappoints... i work in a factory environment and coming from a chinese manufacturer i never thought that the volumes on a loud speaker could be so low. I would go ahead to brand this as the lowest sounding Chinese phone!!! Overall it has been a good buy for me and i would strongly recommend this phone.
0|3|The mobile is looking good and the camera is tooo good. but only issue is that the mobile gets too hot while charging and also when using more than 15 min. i have upgraded with the new update but the same issue is seen. this heating is due to the 64 bit processor, which cannot be rectified.
0|3|I am really sad about to purchase of MI 4i , becz i am having motog2 with compare to moto MI 4i is avg in all categories. Specially camera ,MI have 13MP but with compare to moto (8MP) not gud pic quality. And no need to talk about sound also bez it has a worst sound system i never used like this low sound phone in my life...........screen rotation also very slow compare to other devices..........i really upset with this phone ...........i used so many phones like Samsung,Nokia,Moto & HTC....Compare to this phones same budget also low budget than MI 4i , Mi 4i is a avg phone. i will give 3/5 rating for this device.....
0|2|Beside storage, earpone and heating issue with this phone. The audio sound output is horrible. Ringtone are hardly audiable in crowd and music sound can only be heard in forest. Also the 3G internet speed is so slow HSPA 42.2/5.76 Kbps. Other phone 3G speeds starts with Mbps whereas this phone speed is in Kbps.Also rear camera is not 13MP Dispointed with this point
0|4|Overall Phone is good with excellent features, however I am disappointed with Phone doesnt have Bluetooth Calling feature.
1|4|Display Touch Battery Backup Cam ...................................................... - Sound ...................................................... Overall #PaisaWasul#Phone
0|5|This is my fourth Xiaomi purchase after Mi3, Redmi 1s, Redmi Note and now the Mi 4i! With this device Xiaomi has hit the winning formula once again like it had done in case of the Mi3. The Mi4i is a fantastic phone with great build quality, best display at this price point, an out of the world camera and absolutely superb performance. If you are waiting for a device as good as the Mi3 this is it! The budget the phone the screen the camera everything is superb! Only con is the non expandable memory. But if you have a OTG pen drive that isn't really kill deal.
0|3|Overall the phone is very good. Pros Touch is amazing. (can be compared to iphone 5) UI is also very good. Battery is above average Doesn't hang - Even while multitasking Cons The back cover is rough and slippery Loudspeaker is pathetic. PHONE HEATS UP LIKE A VOLCANO
0|5|really it is a mind blowing smart phone in this price range..i love evrything in this phone, basically its slim design n its screen resolution.cam quality is also awessmmm.
1|2|Hanging during play game (Not proper proccessor and ram). Hanging problem during call. not show properly which person u calling. Ringtone volume very low. I am rating only for Front camera.
0|5|Mi 4i is awsm phone..I use this phone..great looking,great performance..over all is "paisa vasul phone"
0|5|feels like a premiuim device, fluidic performance and great front camera, the built is also good, rugged enough for this price.
0|4|I have used this product for 2 weeks now, When I had switched on the phone after unboxing it started heating, after updating the phone to the new MIUI version the heating issue is solved. It still heats during gaming/when camera is used for slight time, but heating is not so significant. Sound quality is good, not too loud, camera is good, Best part is the sunlight display. Few cons are like No earphone provided in the package,Ram available for use is only around 900mb of the 2gb, Cannot embed photos in contacts. May be the new version of MIUI should include this feature and even decrease the amount of RAM used by the phone.
0|5|In a nutshell, this is one of the best budget phones ever. All credit goes to Xiaomi for the precision engineering. Very handy for one hand use, amazingly crisp display and a good camera, with a long lasting battery. Doesn't heat much with everyday use. A Micro SD slot would have been a cherry on the cake though. Full brownie points to Xiaomi.
0|3|I think following points would be an honest effort towards clearing some doubts among the prospective buyers: 1. Heating is not that much. I am using Lumia 730 dual sim and even with NOKIA brand, my 730 was getting equally hot in Ahmedabad heat. After receiving the phone, I updated the phone (approx. 806 MB file) via WIFI and then downloaded all the Google play applications which were there in my Google play account (when I was using Note 2 or MOTO G 2nd gen). But really what I felt that heating was just like any other smartphone. You cannot expect as 7-8 mm thin smartphone to remain ice cool with all your activities and that too with outside temperature touching 46 c. 2. Display is very good but not like amoled. If you are used to using phones with AMOLED displays, you will not get impressed by the quality of display. But it is not disappointing. Blacks are not as black as in an AMOLED display. But compared to all non-AMOLED phones, display is really classic. 3. MIUI is very intuitive. But few things are really clumsy. Sometimes you get confused due to so many features. Sometimes you do not find the required feature. (e.g. when I tried to assign ringtones downloaded from my dropbox as my sim 1 default ringtone, I could not do it.) I could not find battery charge complete alarm, you have to toggle through various menus to switch off any one of the sim, etc) 4. Phone looks good, though I did not get impressed with its look so much, my wife liked it very much. Keys for volume rocker and power button, which are silver in color are not as smooth as we would like to have. If you pass your finger on that edge of the phone, your feel for the key is not as good. So finishing is not as good as APPLE or even NOKIA would give you. 5. REALLY BIG ISSUE is volume output. You just tend to miss every other call if phone is in your pocket. Even when outside, with ringtone volume set to maximum, you barely hear the ring. So if you are always working in an AC office, it would be okay, otherwise you would definitely miss few calls everyday. 6. Last and final thing, the software is not as intelligent as Windows Phone 8.1. If you have never used Windows Phone, just try it, you will never like any other phone.
1|1|I bought this phone yesterday. Shipment was before delivery date. I dropped phone just 1 feet above ground and display cracked. While using phone I felt lag in operations. I have Zenphone 5 which have same spects and better display compare to Mi. I mean touch is smooth and lo lag at all. I personally don't feel much worth for this phone.Go for zenphone5 rather. I am using 2 zenphones from past 1 yr and no issue at all.
0|3|Perfect model for the price, but.. overheating problem even after updated version of MIUI6 and slight performance degrade w.r.t the competitive models.
0|5|The phone build is excellent phone comes with a matt white colour which looks premium and decent the phone is very slim for the specks and battery it has UI is very practical and useful camera is decent for the price
0|4|When you are looking for a phone in this range: then 1) Camera Quality Perfect 2) Battery Talk time: Perfect Got the phone & First thing i did: 100% battery fully charged: then based on my usage: Skype Usage avg. 2 Hours usage, Whatsapp Usage Avg 3, Hours browsing (You tube: 1 hours) , 4 Hours phone use, In parallel background Processing of Software Updates: 7 Hours Continuous updates done while surfing to skype) After 8 hours of first time usage: Battery Remaining: 55%. 3) Heating Effect: Even my HTC used to get heated up So based on that, this moderate heatup and is ok. Overall Go For this If you are looking for any additional Phone to carry
0|4|Its a good phone , infact a unique phone at this price level, both the cameras are good and the presets are quite ok, i am happy with inbuilt 16GB memory because my needs are less. I havn't tried heavy gaming but sooner I'll download APSALT 8 and WWE IMMORTALS. I am not happy with 3 things - 1. Battery drains quickly like without internet , not too much of call nor sms, not gaming, 100-0% -2 days. couldn't be a problem. 2. phone heats up quickly when some extra usage is done like watching videos. this a problem 3. i am not happy with the volume of the speaker, not that audible in streets, this is the only thing i suggest improvement.
0|4|writing my review after using this devise for 3 days pros-1) light weight, 2) excellent slick design 3) nice themes by xiomi 4) good processor. 5) excellant camera quality. 6) fast charging 7) android lollipop, 2gb ram cons- 1) nonexpandable memory 2) non removable battery 3) no accesories given except charger 4) screenguard n case covers are costly, available only on flipkart (heavy delivery charges) neutral- 1) battery life not that great, good for 1 day use
0|5|ONE OF THE BEST SMART PHONE I HAVE USED EVER,EXCELLENT CAMERA ITS BETTER THAN SAMSUNG E7 SUPER SELFIE FRONT CAMERA. VERY EFFECTIVE FOR PRICE WORTH TO BUY THIS MOBILE.
1|4|To overcome heating issue pls update it with latest MIUI update & keep ur GPS, WiFI and other powerhungry function when not in use. I tried it feel the changes in the heating & battery issues. Finally there is not completely chilling effect but feel lot change. After all when powerfull CPU runs with unbeatable speed gets heat up its a fact.you can find in the all phones having heavy CPU & frequency.
0|3|good display at the time of launch event of Mi 4i, they introduced VISUAL IVR (VIVR) for Mi 4i. But the VISUAL IVR is not working. In the mean time, phone charger is not working from this evening (15.05.2015). I contacted the flipkart, for replacement. They sent the message our team will contact you in two days.
0|5|pros: Display ,camera, interface and performance is very good. cons: low sound gets warm a bit while charging n playing heavy games for 30 min conclusion: Compared to price of 13k cons can be neglected Overall performance is good !
1|2|Pros: (i) Brilliant display. (ii) Good Aspect ratio. Cons: (i) Will heat up if you play games and use youtube or any other games more than 10 mins. (ii) Frequent reboots. Not sure if other are also facing same issue. (iii) Some apps like Facebook, Flipkart are not loading up. (iv) Volume is very less. Even if you are on speaker, it is sometime not audible. Final Conclusion: At the same price lot of other phones are available with more stable operating system. It is better to be away from this phone as they are promising more and giving less.
0|5|yes! I received my Mi4i. Very beautiful and extremely impressive phone.What a great touch!! Stunning camera quality. Its a storehouse of great specifications indeed. The only problem i've faced uptil now is that it get overheated during charging. Why is this so? I could not have got a better phone than this at such an affordable price.
0|4|Good phone , worth for money . But Hangs sometime and low volume
1|2|In a single word i can say it's wonderful, but i am not happy with the phone which i have received. there is some problem in charging, it's not getting charged.
0|3|Pro- excellent camera, good battery back, no lag on lots of application at a time, good in performance. look is pretty good, light weight, fast charging, in just 15 minutes it charged 18-20% which sufficient for next 2-4 hours. around 6-8 hours talk time battery back-up. Cons- Heating issue faced during, but in every new launch phone such issue repeated and surely resolved in 2-3 months after getting updates . Over all phone is best in such price. in comparison other phone it is best light weighted phone. suggest to all if can wait for a month please so finally heating issue will surely resolved.
0|5|I had a L520 until last week and only a windows phone user can realise what I could have possibly been going through. Multiple 'pulling the plug'- forced removal of the batteries in a day being the least of problems. When I did my research to buy a phone with a price range of around 12k, i was considering motog2 and mi4i. Moto g2 being discontunued, I thought will turn out to be a not-so-great buy, as I might stop getting updates in a year or so. Only con I heard from multiple people with mi4i was the heating problem and the higher SAR and of course the non-expandable memory. I loved the miui6 interface when i checked it out on their site. Went for it knowing I was taking a risk with the heating problem, especially when reviews here in Flipkart itself had pointed to the problem specifically. As it turned out, the battery problem is a non-existent problem. I am not much into gaming and have not tried out any processor intensive games yet. But normal browsing and even while charging, the rear side is only luke warm. Unless of course you think that the non-expandable memoru is a serious CON for you, this is a strongly recommended buy. I love the MIUI6.
1|4|I was worried only about heating based on the reviews, but I got the phone today and there is no such problem I played games and browsed still it was cool and also even when charging. It is very good one at this price. Battery performance is little lower for 3120MAH. Video quality is good. Rear Camera is good. Front camera is not so good Overall can go for it who all looking budget mobile phone.
0|3|concerns, heating problem, battery back up problem there is no head phone with phone & screen guard. pros, good display stylish look
0|4|this is my first xiaomi phone - only one word for the phone - awesome and also this phone has only one big big big problem - heating issue . i am using it for 3 days i have updated phone but heating issue is not solved it heats up lot during charging and calling that's not normal . all the features provide in this phone are great camera , screen, body but comes with problem of heating . if you want to buy this phone you should ignore heating but you can't it's good for winter but during summer it's unbearable . i think xiaomi should really fix this problem if they do this will be the best phone. till then a big "NO" for this phone . don't buy this phone till they the solve problem .
0|5|Used it for just 3 day - Initial Reviews are very positive ! Pros - Aweome Display, lightweight, sensitive touch, fast processor, excellent camera (front and back), value for money, excellent themes. Cons - 1 day battery life....surely no heating issue experienced till now. Had a pathetic delivery experience with flipkart. Better to order via COD.
0|5|Got the device delivered today at 10:30 AM (within 24 hrs). Opened the box and was impressed by the looks and design, prepared the SIM card for the device and starting playing around, very much satisfied with specifications and the performance of the device.
0|5|Awesome mobile. Running Smooth. User interface better than other Flagship mobiles. Battery backup one day for moderate usage.
1|2|After using of 10 days I am scripting this Pros: Display is good Very handy Interface is good Build quality is good Cons: Heating problem Voice is very low when ever incoming and out going calls too The main problem I faced in this device is heating. Still now I am unable to use the phone for calling more than 10 min. I am using the speaker phone every time if the call is more than 5 min too. The problem was persistent even I downloaded latest updates provided by mi. Earlier, I used lumia 620. I never faced this kind of problem with that device even though if I talk more than 1 hour.
0|5|I’ll just point out some of the features that I notice in this handset Pros: • Specs are really amazing for the price. • Very lightest and user friendly handy. • Display is vibrant and viewing angle is awesome. • Camera is too good for the price both front and rear. • Very good gaming experience butter smooth UI experience despite of some minor bugs [hope the update solves it] • Battery is simply awesome and simply better than expected. You can except almost 2 days battery backup if you are a moderate user. • Heating: doesn't heat up usually, but i gets a little warm on using certain apps and games but i think it’s normal • Battery charge decent but through USB kind of slow. Cons: • Biggest con is its 16gb internal memory which cannot be expanded further with MSD CARD.. • Can’t set own ring tone look like some bug.
1|2|The look and feel, the performance, configuration as claimed by everybody are awesome. Apart from that the phone does not connect well on 3G network. However, 3G works better in sim slot 2 than slot 1.Poor 3G network holding is a concern. No headphones was provided with phone.
0|4|complete bang for the money! Overheating and all.. chuck the crap. Look for what you're getting at this price point. Excellent display plus great camera setup makes this phone more worthy. Worth a buy! Let the phone settle once you unbox it and its good to go.
0|5|Received the mobile in good condition. Although my mobile was lost in the transit, flipkart arranged to send a second phone. Fortunately I received the first one and flipkart cancelled the second one. The mobile reached 2 days later than the expected date of delivery. The box packaging was good and mobile was in good condition. Xiaomi Mi4i is a mobile which offers splendid features at a small price. I am very happy to receive this phone. It performs and outperforms other chinese handsets. Its tieup with Gadgetwood gives one day mobile service. The mobile is working without lag and the screen is brilliant. The touchpad response is quick. Camera and video quality is superb. The mobile is handy, sleek and light weight. It's loaded with some pre-installed applications.
1|5|Bought this phone through flipkart sale on 30.04.2015. Initially encountered heating issues (too much), but once the update was done, no heating issue. Also surprisingly a fully charged was discharged without any usage by evening. The problem has however not re-occurred. Good buy at this price.

0|5|Very Good camera is awesome performances to good so slim go for it we can buy there is no heating problem we can update this to miui6 then no problem
0|5|Xiaomi has once again done some marvel through their new device mi4i. It provides by far the best android flagship experience on a budget mobile. With decent specs and nice build quality powered up by excellent display and great camera output, it's surely the leader in its price range. Here you can lick Lollipop along with MIUI 6. For a mid user, it's a perfect phone with a handy and trendy display area. Considerable light weight makes it even more beautiful. Thumbs up for xiaomi for making global launch of the device through India. It has captured the pulse of the mobile ecosystem much better than the market bigwigs like Apple, Samsung, nexus, Nokia etc as their new devices are available in India only after months of global launch. Here I won't explain about the device features & functioning. I straight away recommend it and advise to have a bite, you will not repent for it. Vacate your mind from all the preoccupied mobiles, start exploring it, soon you will start to love it. It has all the potential to fulfill common smartphone user needs. Above all it supports my mother tongue Kannada everywhere in the device, which is awesome.
0|4|bought this phone in the first flash sale of flip kart on April 30th. Flip karts delivery was very fast. The phone is very good, lightweight and convenient to use. The user interface is beautiful and very customisable. The camera is brilliant. Although the screen did hang up a few times and had to restart the phone to resolve the issue, I still think the device is totally worth the price of 12999/-
0|5|Great product for 13K, Pros Great Display, Battery lasts for 1 full day for an average user Sleek Design Cons 16 Gb is too less, actually u will get approx 9.5GB I have being using it for a week now, it hung thrice, where in the phone becomes unresponsive for 3-5 minutes, i have raised the issue with flipkart, they told to do sw reset, will try over the weekend
1|4|Good to have great specs at this cost. Heating problem while in use and charging.
0|5|Beautiful phone... The thing i luv most are the display, cam and the design.... No much heating.... I haven't updated till now.....
0|5|I have changed 2 phones(YU-Yureka & Honor Holly) before settling for this ultimate beast of phone. I get more than a day's battery life (mild Wi-FI use and continuous 2G Usage all day long). Dint find any heating issues. Lollipop is well merged with MIUI. UI feels permium, The Ultimate attraction of the phone being its Camera. The selfies taken have a very crisp and clear images and the rear camera is excellent. Guys incase u need a phone with best in class camera and good battery life , go for this Mi 4I.
0|4|In this price, you won't get such specification in any phone in market right now. Review after one week use: Pros: 1) No heating problem faced till now as raised by other buyers. 2) Look is nice and performance is very efficient. 3) Gives a very good battery life(Initial few days). 4) Good camera. Cons: 1) Sound is on bit lower side. Overall its a very good buy.
0|5|qualities : good looking slim good performance good battery backup. But one thing i want to say company should also provide headset. without that it seems to be half package.
0|5|MI MI Mi really amazing phone on 13k.I dont have any other phone which is compare with this phone. Amazing. Be live me no heating issue.
0|5|1st MI product with such a gr8 camera Love the looks and design. some battery issue like 1st 50% battery drains very fast but rest will remain whole day :P
0|4|To be frank, I was a lil confused where or not to buy this mobile. But after seeing the working of the other Mi mobiles, I went on to buy this one. I was not dissapointed after buying this mobile.. not at all :D The first thing that blows your mind is the clarity of the camera. Both the primary and the secondary cams are really awsum. and with good lighting sense, you could click some amazing pictures with this phone. the calrity, music player clarity will be the other things that will WOW you. final statement. Overall this is a Good buy. The device does gets heated at times due to overusage. in my case, i was using the internet, downloading few songs, playing an online game, and the device was on charge as well on the same time. It didn get heated if the usage is minimal.
0|5|Let me tell you this phone is Simply Excellent & value for money. I am beaning using this phone from last 4-5 days & I have charge only two times battery backup is great! along with display. In all good package in 13,0000/- Team MI congratulation for this invention!!
1|1|Pros - Good battery with normal usage - V good screen under both normal and sunlight - Good size for one handed use - Camera considering the price range - Average heating during normal use like 3G usage or calls. Gaming will heat up any phone Cons - Speaker sound output is horrible- most of the times cant hear the ringing if its in slightly loud ambient noise like a street or if your tv is on - Phone appears slow in everything compared to my Google nexus 4(which is 3 yrs old tech) - If you are used to stock android experience like Nexus series or Motorola, MIUI will be a big let down. - RAM management is a disaster, am sure due to MIUI Overall its a good choice in the price range. However having said that we purchase and trust Flipkart because of its excellent return/replacement policy apart from the pricing. In my case I wanted to return it, because being an avid biker its unusable as I cant detect the phone ringing whenever I am on the road whereas my Nexus does. But they refused flatly. Then what is the point of buying something online without even checking it out personally.
0|3|The phone has a splendind look that attracts everyone.The miui user interface and display is absolutely superb.The camera is not that good as u expect for a 13mp but u can adjust with that considering the price for which u get the device. but the only problem is that the phone get heated while making the calls while using the camera
0|3|Great Phone with heating issues Pros: Unibody Design, Ultra-compact Frame 2nd-gen Snapdragon 615 Processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB Flash 12.7 cm Sharp/JDI 1080p Display All-new Sunlight Display, Corning OGS Glass 13MP Sony /Samsung Camera f/2.0 aperture, Two-tone Flash 5MP Front Camera with Beautify 4.4V 3120 mAh Battery, 4G Dual SIM MIUI 6 on Android L Cons: Heating issues No expendable storage
0|2|Bought the phone on first day's flash sale. The phone looks good in specs perspective, but, if you talk for more time for single call you will feel the phone getting heated. Overall, the averge phone. Given the price bracket at which the Xiaomi sells, the phone its ok to be bought if you feel that you can ignore the heating issues.
0|5|So, i am using this phone for about 1 week now. This is a greeaatt phone at this price range. The unified body is very compact. U can stay relaxed if it falls from ur hand. Trust me, Nothing will happen! Not even a scratch! Pros- 1.One of the best Battery Life among all the phones i used (I keep on buying phones every after 6 months) 2.The high ppi Display makes it look premium 3.Heats up very less (as compared to the iphone 6), which is again pretty decent. I have seen some negative reviews on heating issue. Now u cant expect a high end featured phone to heat up at all! 4. MIUI 6 is definitely the best UI in the market right now. Use it to know it. 5. Snapdragon Processors are Trust worthy (dsnt lags up after prolonged usage for a long time tat mostly happens with mediatek and other cheap processors) which are often used on high end phones 6. Camera is insanely Awessome! No 13mp & 5mp Phone camera can be better dan this Cons 1. Available in only one colour. Cud have looked more premium if it is black. White looks a lot dull as compared to Black
0|5|good delivery by e kart .. mi 4i great phone ever camera 10/10 both front and rear proccer 10/10 battery life all most one and half days over all mi 4i is such a great phone and it a budge phone there no heating issue....... this 13k mi 4i is like a 31k........
1|5|Most liked things about the phone are build & design(compact & light weight), camera quality,display clarity(441 PPI),batterybackup, Some smart interface in MI UI. One thing complain about is heating slightly so don't know about the durability. Giving it 5 stars just because its the price at which its being offered
0|5|BEST DISPLAY, CAMERA, BATTERY NORMALLY HEATING ISSUE PERSONALLY RECOMMEND..... ...............................................................................................................................
0|3|HEATING ISSUE, even you charge this phone or navigate/access applications for 15-20 mins, you will feel the heat at front and back both side. It's light in weight and have excellent configuration in 13K range though.
0|5|This is the 11th xiaomi phone i am buying for my friends and family. Worldly looks and top-notch specs make it impressive. Love the mi theme store. Many talk about heating problem. As i dont play much games i did not encounter any such problems. Service and repair yet to prove..
0|4|It is my first smartphone and i have bought it after 2 months of research.To say the least,Boy i'm impressed.Though i was a bit skeptical about it as many have reviewed it as a frying pan which gets heated up a lot.I would say they are talking shit.I have not played Asphalt 8 on it so far but i have used 10 apps at a time and it works pretty smooth and heats up slightly.The 2 GB RAM makes this phone a steal in this price range.The display is amazing and the videos look superb in the 1080p screen.The only thing bothering me is the 16GB ROM as i know i would want to have more when it runs out.And about the heating issue, it gets heated up while charging and while using numerous apps at a time, but just slightly and that happens with every smartphone. The back camera is good and the front camera is something you can compare to that of iphone's.This itself says a lot about the phone.The build is sturdy and glossy.And with a regular use, it gives me a battery usage of up to 16 hours. P.S. -Just register and go for it, it is worth a try and i assure you that you won't regret it.
1|4|Nice phone under 15000rs but speaker sound is not good.. screen and display is good ... it is good for normal use but don't expt that this phone compete the other phone which have same config.... this pone have very limitd space that is 10.88 gb that's not good for heavy game and apps user's........
1|5|I was concerned reading reviews about heating issues. But I bought it anyhow for it's good camera. I observed that the heating is normal. My Moto G heats up more !! When you keep the phone on charging or Do continuous downloads or play heavy Games, the phone heats up. It's absolutely normal!
0|4|Best Phone at this price range. Camera is too good. And i would like to thanks Flipkart for delivery at next day of order.
0|4|This is my second xiomi phone,previous was mi3, iwanted to buy a second phone and after various decided why not xiomi again. SO got my mi4i delivered within 3 days. fabulous phone..... easy to hold compared to the mi3... the dispaly is superb love the front camera as well. the body contour is well designed ...not edgy as the mi3..but curvaceous. overall a superb phone and value for money. go for it.
0|5|Got my mi 4i on 9th, so superb delivery time by flipkart. First of all people who are complaining about heating go buy nokia 6600 because you still live in 2003. Pros: on comparing with current smart phones with latest technology there are no heating issues. superb speed. no lags Good camera under 15K good battery. got 30hrs backup on 3G lightweight and superb quality. No network or connection issues. people who are saying there is problem go get your sim cards replaced. Super Awesome screen with best Contrast even galaxy S6 dont stand a chance. Only CON: light was leaking from bottom right corner of the screen near back touch button. got the handset replaced today. couldn't find out till now lets see if there is leak or not.
0|5|phone is awesome but there is some issue with miui 6 cause some apps stucks..... but anyway performace is quite impressive in terms of camera and battery life. nice phone in this price range
0|5|This phone has the best camera atleast, it can compete against much costlier phones with ease. To enjoy no lags in performance go to settings-additional settings-battery settings and set it to performance mode. only problem is that it gets heated up but which phone doesn't? Hell even Iphone 6 gets heated up. BEST IN THE PRICE RANGE.
0|5|The device has very nice display, performance is very good, camera gets more points as it has amazing capturing quality, Very cooool device even if sometime heating up (not so much....) Heating prob may be occur due hot summer i think so...... Please provide accessories as soon as possible....
0|4|Pros: 1. Network 2. Slim Body 3. Smart Pricing 4. Smooth Touch 5. Smooth operating System Cons. 1. Phone gets heated while using bluetooth, using under sunlight. 2. Phone available only in white background. Please release other variant. Overall value for money, but Xiaomi should work fast on the heating problem.
0|5|its awesome but i faced a slight heating problem while downloading asphalt8 and playing stick cricket 2 at a time. apart from it its really awesome n its really good in competing with apple features @ base price..
1|4|the phone is getting over heated while on charging and net browsing. No ear phones are provided with the phone
1|4|I had serious doubts about this product when I ordered it.I must say it has surpassed my expectations in the past few days. Pros Good battery back(Last ones full day with wifi on) amazing screen response Customizable themes Light weight Camera with in built instagram features Cons Heats up sometimes(not too hot though) The hardware is not upto the mark.One of my friends dropped it a day back and on contacting service centre,He was shocked to know that the screen alone would cost an approximate 7000 Rs. Service centre in Indranagar(Bangalore) had negative responses when I approached them on just getting my sim slot opened as it got stuck.It was jus 10 seconds of work ,which they refused to do because their server was down.Post sale service is an issue unless you get the right service centre.
0|4|Pone is nice and cute, the problem is phone is getting heated after net usage. face detection is useless camera is also good. taking time for full charge of battery
0|4|Have been using this for a weak now - Except the battery - Rest everything else is superb and classy. for a 3100Mah battery , it lasts only for a day and with only 2 apps running. Otherwise the phone is awesome in looks and classy to use . Looks , color , touch, user interface all *****. Battery - ***
0|4|i purchased the mi4i in last week i got a phone in Saturday afternoon thanks ekart from trichy mobile quality and stylish good looking call quality super themes and ram speed good and i think memory spece is poor compare to another mobile external card i load tamil apps some logs will occur and heating problem in continues talking and wifi mode on. this is first week review
1|4|Awesome Phone but Heating Problem. phone is very hot in charging time and when we use phone. and latest updation not show.
0|3|i received mi4i device may14th . product is very nice but there is a leak in the display. When i'm in a completely dark room, I can see light from the capacitative buttons leaking from the bottom edge of the phone. i requested to flipkart for replace the device.
0|5|Looking at specification I had lot of expectations on this phone. It didn't met all the specifications though great product to buy. As they said display is superb but lagging in brightness compared to one plus one. Also sunlight display doesn't have much effect. touch is awesome. camera is excellent under good light conditions and average in dim light. camera features like magic focus are good. there are no much changes in user interface. Sound is a bit low in this device. call quality is good. battery also stand good. Build quality is good, very thin and light weight. Many users complained about heating issues, but handset i received didn't had any problem with heating. Finally MI4I is a good gamble at this price range.
1|5|Great build quality. But like everyone else is saying, there is some heating problem. Most of the things are good.
1|1|NEW review - Right half of the screen is blackish if u see in low brightness...looks like some problem in the screen. OLD review- looks are very good feels good in the hand no lags back camera is very good outside,,,,,above average in low light front camera is very good no lags in game-play.... there was a bit of heating on top back and front.... after update (810mb) the heating is very less....i recommend updating ram available is 1 gb (i think the other 1 gb is is reserved for the UI...and ui is very fluid) speaker vol is above average.....not very high... sound is good overall very good experience
1|5|Just received the phone yesterday. So far So good. Just heats little bit but i guess that can be resolved with OS update. Nice service by flipkart and good phone by Xiomi
0|5|I thing this phone is the best phone in this price segment Pros: Display: Unparalleled full HD display with sunlight technology Camera: Very good cameras (both front & rear), much better than many flagships Flash: Good flash with dual tone Battery: Good backup Call Quality & Network Reception: Very good LED: Optimum light for notifications etc. Dual SIM: Both SIM cards can support 3G or 4G. Build Quality: Very Good Cons: Slight Heating: Normal in octacore processors Sound: Average
1|4|using it fora past couple of days no heating issues as such grt cameras nd display but rom only 12gb overall go for it at this range
0|4|A Good Phone under budget, although i do believe there are a few areas for improvement visually, battery life is commendable and decent for a person who is online most times, there are no hanging issues which i'm pretty happy about, however i would like to point out, would appreciate if the software was already updated rather than updating afterwards. The user interface is very simple just like its predecessors, very lightweight impressive, sound quality needs improvement very low and not so clear in terms of listening to music over the speakers, voice clarity is really nice and smooth, would like to recommend a few point outs would be helpful if multi-window would be a feature for multiple usage of apps during calls especially. Over all i'm happy with the product for now ...
0|4|Best phone under 15k Excellent build quality. Excellent display. Camera fine in outdoor. Phone will heat up while using camera and gps. Battery back up also good. But Strictly no for gamers.
0|5|I received this product on 4th May; however I was not allowed to review it till now because the courier guys didn't update the status of delivery. Luckily this helped me test the phone thoroughly. Earlier I was using Samsung S3 which has been one of the best sellers from Samsung; so the expectations were high. Review of the Phone: Box- The box has phone, charger cum USB and a pin. This was a first time that i was using the pin to insert and open the Sim holding tray. After much fiddling, I somehow managed. Phone - As given in descriptions that entire front body is monocoque. The 5" screen displays colors brilliantly and the much acclaimed 441 pixel density is reflected in the beauty of the display. For display I would review it complete 5. UI: The user interface is the latest MIUI 6. Its buttery smooth. However I was surprised that there is no MENU button. All apps are stored in the subsequent screens. And to uninstall you have to just drag them to the top, Pretty handy ! 4.5* Sim: I have been using only one SIM as of now so the duality performance cant be described Processor: One common problem which everyone has written is heating of phone. I have been using this in the heat of Delhi's kind summer with temperatures hovering around 44. I have had upto 4-5 apps opened at the same time and I dint find the overheating problem at all. And kindly note these apps dont go light on the RAM. The process was smooth and I didnt find much of a lag. However even though the stated RAM is 2GB, the free RAM for usage is only around 700-800 MB. 5* Battery - This is the process I followed. Previous night I had 100% charge at 11 pm after which I slept. Next day I used the phone for calls, intermittent Wifi, bluetooth transfers, games and 2G all the time. Till 7pm i had 45% still remaining. This is far better than S3 which I had to charge twice for sailing over a day. 5* Storage - I am not much of a extreme stuff ur phone guy. Inspite of all the apps that i need and all the songs that i want to listen to, I have around 8GB of space in this. If you are a bit on the higher side of usage of space, kindly refrain from buying this. This phone provides only 10 GB usable space and it is non expandable. Camera: I compared the light and dark photos of S3 and Mi 4i and there is a huge difference. The photo qualities are way better. However You wont find much in built camera features to tinker with the photo. You would need to install secondary apps for modifying photos. 5* I am like the majority of the crowd here... no expert or geek in cell phones but I do know whats a good phone when I use one. The S3 lasted with me for 3 years inspite of rough usage. This has been only for a week; however I see leaps and bounds of improvement in phone half the cost and twice the performance. You wont regret buying this phone; however if you have serious reservations against the Chinese brand mindframe thing, Asus Zenfone may prove to be a strong alternative.
0|4|Want to appreciate sales and after sales service by FLIPKART. Delivery was made before promise date. Also guys are co-operative and understanding. Now coming too the product: At this price range what Xiomi offering is very good. Camera quality is good. Phone is light weight. It has 1 GB RAM for user and 1 GB is for phone. Overall it is a value for money product.
0|4|Using it for 2 weeks now. Things I like: 1.Very compact and lightweight for a 5 incher 2. Brilliant Display 3.One Hand use is a charm 4. No performance issues 5. Both SIM LTE Capable Things that need improvement: 1. The earpiece gets heated so gets uncomfortable while taking call especially if you want to sneak it in your Helmet. Long duration calls have to be taken via a headset because of the heat. 2. Battery life not all that great even with such a large battery 3.Lack of accessories from MI Yes, I would recommend this phone to my friends.
0|4|Received it yesterday...so far so good, heating problem 'yes' but not much as it is described in some of the other reviews...yes its getting heated(mild) while charging and continuous online gaming. good looks...functions are as proper and up to the mark as per config... Display,Camera, Music player and MIUI are simply fantastic (could be brilliant...would it have been equipped with infrared for mobile-remote like use and expandable memory...obviously with a higher price tag...should not much though) Flipkart-team... a big HUG to you :)
0|5|firstly would like to thank flipkart for their superb service , received handset in less than 48 hours with no extra pay, coming to device - its awesome display-9/10 ease of use 9/10 camera rear is good , clicks good pics, front camera is superb like everything about this device heard alot about heating issue , the moment u power it up u can feel the heat but as soon as its updated to latest version it settles down to normal , note- i dont play games , so user experience might vary for others only regret is low memory, but still can be managed,
0|5|first of all IT DOES NOT REPEAT DOES NOT HEAT. i had a xiaomi note 3g bot just 6 months back and very content with it. but when i saw this beauty immediately registered and got it. sold of my note 3g costing 8999 at 7500. what a beauty this phone is. doesnt compete with any 30k phone but mayb the flagship ones. superb full HD screen. stunning camera with beautification mode which has to be seen to be believed. only negative thing is of course no SD card. but if can live with it just GO FOR THIS BEAUTY. best value for money ever.
0|5|Pros: # Light weight # Slim # Good battery # Feels value for money # MIUI has not obvious bugs # 2A charger in the box Cons: # Heat up when the processor is busy or is getting charged
0|4|Got delivered in 2 days. Good phone if not great. Using Galaxy Note 2 hence not as smooth as note 2 but good for the price. Camera is Ok. Heating is there but not that much but you can feel that. Some lag here and there. Light weight. Great Display. Battery will last for a day easily.
0|4|Best buy in its price segment but i facing some issues with internet connectivity let me check it out whether its company fault or with the carrier not yet sure !! . Else its the best buy
0|5|Excellent product complete value for money, its worth a buy and would like to recommend it. Perfect size, perfect weight and very light in weight
0|2|After long struggle with my redmi2 I bought mi 4i . Overall its a brilliant design , camera is decent , interface is very good , battery is also compromising . When it comes to network it cannot cope up with a normal phone also . Phone is getting heat like hell !!!! afraid to keep in my pocket . out of 16gb internal memory only 9gb is available for user which is disappointing :( And when it comes to RAM out of 2GB 750mb is available and rest all acquired by running application and in my case I didn't installed any new application in my phone except whatsapp and wechat ...
0|5|Considering the price range, that this phone falls in, i found this phone to be very pleasing. One true fact, this phone does heat up, not very much though..its manageable (although i haven't used it to its full) but its feature and performance is flawless! Anyone one who is a general user will find this phone to be awesome, but if u want really heavy gaming and multitasking (please mark the word HEAVY) then u might b a bit disappointed as it heats up a bit. Highly recommended, is best in its class and best for average and above average users. My experience with this phone- Its awesome, m happy after buying it :-)
0|4|Hey guys I am very happy to tell u all that those who have still doubt for purchasing this phone then I tell don't get confused just go for it. Its so light weight and really eye catching device.Let me tell u why this phone is truly awesome bcoz it gives best ui,good camera,battery is really getting charged so fast u want believe when I charged it when battery from 10%-100% it got charged in just couple of hours say like 2hrs 15 min. The company proved it.!!! The only con in this device is lack of expandable memory those who can manage by 16 GB internal just purchase it. Its a great deal @13K I am so much satisfied thats why wrote this review. And last but not the least those who are saying that heating issue is there I tell u that as a high end device when playing high graphics game will make phone heat otherwise in normal usage its totally manageable. Thank you xiaomi for making this kind of phone and flipkart too for getting me delivered in quick 3 days.
0|5|I bought the phone on 30 April .I have used the phone for 15 days. Its performance its good . It heats up very much but it occurs rarely , when i work all day .Its battery is very good it stands for 1 1/2 days.It has a very good camera it is great to take photos with it.There are a lot of themes so we can change it as per our thoughts and mood. i love this phone . It is the most suitable phone for me. mi 4i is a phone value for the money given
0|5|I am absolutely convinced that this phone is the best value for money. The hardware it has to offer is available in most premium flagship phones, but you get the incredible hardware at less than half the price of any flagship. The MIUI 6 makes for a smooth software experience and the hidden cherries keep you interested in what the phone can do. Yes, the Snapdragon 615 warms up a little bit under HEAVY usage, but it is nothing inconvenient as such. It is not expected of any smartphone to be cold as ice anyways. Design: 5/5 Hardware: 5/5 Software: 5/5 Overall: 5/5 If you are looking for a phone under 15,000/- look no further, as THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PHONE you can purchase at this price point.
0|4|Much better than Mi4 and Mi3. Processor is very fine for working, front camera absolutely osum, best buy with compare to Samsung Galaxy and GOOGLE nexus.
0|3|I not received my headset in package, delivery service is good packaging is bad sent my head as soon as please give my extra money for headset
1|4|there is a heating issue in this redmi 4i.but i think redmi will improve this problem by providing software update. light weight phone,good camera quality.after using it for one day i think that battery is good.sound problem is there as it was also in mi4.ringtone sound and music sound is little bit low. otherwise a good phone at this cost by redmi.
0|5|Great features with a best price........also the most important thing is that , it's look adds more effect on its excellence......
0|5|It was a good experience to buy a phone online without any problem. May be I'm lucky who got the chance to get this phone. I got my delivery in time. Many thanks to Flipkart Team.
0|5|Worth every rupee paid, awesome product, battery last for the whole day, great display, perfect built quality, great show Xiomi keep it up
1|2|so much heating mobile........& gujarati language is not support sometime charging automatically closed
0|4|I have been using this phone for a week and there are more positives than a single minus for this amazing phone . Camera: Unparalleled camera quality , no matching it . Pictures clicked at night needs improvement . Battery : Battery is 3120 mah . Support for you for the whole day , but still feels more like a 2200 mah . Good though . Display : Quality of the picture is amazing where it steals the show and has no comparism with the counterparts . Performance : Switching between application lags a bit if you compare it to Moto G2 . Look and feel of the phone is very good . Easy to grab and use with a single hand . Heating is an issue with the phone and xiaomi has to take it seriously with the some future updates to rectify this . Overall the phone still needs improvement in terms of fluidity in switching applications. Apart from that its the best buy below 13k . If you care more about the performance and less about battery or camera, go with MotoG2 . If you want a light weight power packed ,excellent camera with good battery android phone , this is where you stop your search .
0|5|A perfect build phone, who cares about external storage which makes the phone lag. I'm perfectly enough with the phone.
0|4|Screen Freeze issue resolved. Still struggling to install whats app and Nike + 1/5 for Nike + and What's app download and installation issue. 4 /5 for Built, camera, Sound, Battery,weight and looks . 5/5 for resolving screen Freeze issue after lollypop upgrade.
1|4|Hi friends, its a good phone ... while using internet i can browse very fast like i phone ... because it's 2 GB RAM. Only defective is volume is very low. As per my opinion it's a good one.
0|4|Xiomi Mi4i is really a good mobile, with very good performance. The white phone with matte finish feels great in hands.
0|5|its very sleek and slim... very nice configuration.. Dual Sim Dual LTE Very Nice ... Affordable and Fast Processor..
0|4|MI 4I mobile looks so good and a very slim mobile and it is more good if it is provide micro SD card slots option .
0|4|After using this phone for a day! I found, It takes time to boot-up. I don't know why! apart from that everything seems to be cool since past 24 hours.
0|5|Amazing phone, had to admit the picture quality is really too good, but the heating problem persists only with a bit of load on the device. Everything else is really cool and its a total value for money .. The camera quality is superb also, its quite light in weight..although didn't expect it to be that light :).. and the battery backup is excellent. I would recommend this among the best buy in this range of phones.
0|5|Pros : 1) Killing Looks 2) Super slim 3) Great UI, with lots and lots of customization 4) Sharper High End phone screen (1080p, 441ppi) 5) 2GB RAM. Cons : 1) Limited Memory ( 16GB)....not a problem if u have a habit of syncing data to cloud. 2) Battery backup is for 1.5 days.....but not as good as 3100Mah battery phone.....(this is due to high contrast screen.....cannot blame the phone for this) -- but this is more than sufficient for me. 3) Feeling little more warmer when camera is used for long time...( due to its slim design)...but it comes down to its normal state soon.......But I dont think this is a problem..... Summary: Surely its an eye catcher. High performing phone....The best in the price range.
0|5|phone is great....1) amazing looks 2) great display quality
0|3|Good phone and got delivered soon from expected time....................Service is appreciable...............
0|4|The phone is excellent. I was using Samsung Galaxy S4 and I can say that this is even worth compare to S4. Many of users has mentioned the heating issues with the phone but i could not find it anymore even after long duration use. (May be i have downloaded the latest update right after turning on the phone) Pros: 1.Smart Handy Looks 2. Actually Slim 3. Both Camera Mainly Front is Too Good 4. Its Full HD Display but i feel it Ultimate FHD Cons: 1. There is Gap(Lag) at the bottom of the phone from where the light is coming out. It seems to be have manufacturing defect.( After checking with 2 different phones ). Conclusion : Its worth buying @13K with most advance features.
0|5|Awesome specs for the money. Incredible display, great camera. Heating issues solved by the update, phone performs really well afterwards. Make sure you take the latest update!
1|1|I have ordered the Mi4i in first flash sale as of excitement by watching the features I was expecting more from this but after receiving the I got disappointment as only charger and Phone with very small user guide also unable to insert SIM as Sim card removal pin is missing ...as its Pros- Light Weight Good Battery Cons Chiniese Phone feeling as back body is low quality plastic Hanging Issue Heating Issue Screen Blinking Issue Camera quality is not good after zooming normal pictures its splits MiUI is not user friendly So my suggestions dont buy for 13k
0|1|Look & configuration wise phone is good but it heats like anything. People should not buy this phone at all.
0|4|Pros:- slim Design,high battery backup, high screen resolution, camera is good. cons:- heating problem while on call ( tolerable) Sound is bit low. Overall :- A must buy phone compared to other under 25k range phone
0|4|pros: look is perfect, feels like i phone type premium look. Perfectly fits into the pocket. Superb camera quality, Front facing camera is outstanding, best for selfie lover. Battery back up is also best. overall gaming experience is better, played Asphalt 8, it plays smoothly. Thank god this phone does NOT heat too much like another Xiaomi phones. Cons: There are only some negative sides of this phone. Mainly it is Non-Expandable for SD Card. Back cover is Dust sticky in nature. In overall i strongly recomend it.
0|1|Battery perofoprmance is not upto the mark. UIMI has lot of bugs. Facebook works well in WiFi only. Camera works well in daylight only. You will get noisy images in low light.
0|1|The phone has heating issues, it get heated just in few minutes after switching it on which is really irritating after paying this so huge amount of Rs. 12999. Dont buy it.
0|2|had no heating issues, battery lasts only for a day, miui6 completely overshadows android lollipop ,firm,slightly slippery, back panel is also good,screen and camera quality are ok,but at the last it is CHINESE
1|1|Hi... I bought this phone on 1st flash sale...very quick delivery..received on 2nd day even though it was a holiday in between. But the pone heats up even after the update. Moreover at the bottom of the phone there was a line when backlight illuminates, can see only in dark. I got replacement product, but even in that the same problem, in fact bigger line than earlier. Finally i returned the phone and got refund. Gud service flipkart team. thanks.
0|4|Build and Design: 8/10 Features: 8/10 Performance: 7/10 Display: 8.5/10 Camera: 8/10 Battery Life: 8/10 ** This phone is also Heating bar. Overall I like this phone @ Rate of 12999/-
0|4|I have been using this mobile for a week now and I am really satisfied with this mobile. The display is crisp, clear. It can play 1080p vids well. I use my mobile mostly for reading ebooks and browsing, and it is a treat to read in this mobile. The phone is a treat to hold. Got premium looks and use. When I start games or some resource consuming apps, it tends to heat up a bit after 2 mins, then gradually the heat seems to settle down. The lock button and volume rocker is made of stainless steel but still feels (not looks) a bit flimsy when pressing. Call clarity is good, speaker sound is of good quality, though a bit low on decibels. MIUI is good, some other nifty features like call recording, already built into it and also provides some good bit of personalization. Browsing is a breeze. UI doesnt lag. The 10 GB storage space is a concern. This constraint makes me think twice when I am installing any app or videos. I am sure that two months down the line, I will be using a lot of OTG to move my whatsapp videos and what not to my PC :( lack of accessories at the time of the launch is a bit of a let down. Overall, a real good mobile at this price range.
0|1|THIS IS MY 3RD MOBILE BUT I DONT WHY THEY HAVE NOT INCLUDED USER MANUAL & SIM REMOVAL DRIVER IN THIS KIT ONLY USB CHARGER & PHONE THAT IT...FLIPKART SHOULD BE ANSWRABLE FOR THIS MESS.
1|4|Before buying and investing money on this phone, I did a lot of research on various review websites and also did a comparison with the other phones in the same category and found the Mi4i as the winner in terms of performance, durability and value for money. Most of the review sites, gave the phone an average score of 8 out of 10 (more than 30 websites). The score is justified. I have been using this phone for a few days and it has been very good. No complaints whatsoever. There is a slight heating issue, which is common in all smart phones ( i migrated from an iPhone 5s to Mi4i, even apple phones are prone to heating). The heating issue has been exaggerated in the product review page most of the times. It is negligible and putting a case/cover, solves this little heating issue. Like me, many would be confused, as to which phone one must buy since there so many options available. Your search should end here, I suppose! Go for it!
0|1|There is a major problem of heating up the phone while you keep the phone in charging,it gets heated up to 43 degrees which is unbearable to talk on call.Even when you use your mobile data 2G/3G for 20 minutes the phone heats up to 41-42 degree. Flipkart customer service people say that it is allowed till 45 degree but it is unbearable to talk on call even in 41 degree. I Suggest please don't buy this phone.
0|1|Very dedicated worst customer support ….. I purchased Mi4I and on bad part the phone has lots of issues like Heating, volume etc; per the policies of Flipkart once the request is raised; they respond within 24 hours. Firstly; they are so dedicated that they cannot revert to customers upon receiving the complaint. Secondly; when we call to customer care; customer care associates does charity for the customers by responding to their phone calls. Response from customer care is so great that; directly and rudely communicates to customers that; For India; any phone heating capacity is 48C and if it goes beyond 48c then will take the request and will process it and so if it is less 48C you can enjoy the heat of your phone and can be used for multipurpose like IRON BOX and OVEN and they are not gonna replace it...KUDOS to FLIPKART and its policies...... .
0|5|Thanks to Flipkart for delivery on Sat Morning. Gave me enough time to use the phone as on weekdays i cannot use this phone. No Comparison needed for this phone, In my family i have Iphone 4s , 5s redmi 1s and this is a new Addition. I dont know how ppl are facing Heating issues, i faced none. Temp was around 39-41 which is acceptable. During Afternoon when ac was turned on temp was 30. Played Asphalt 8 for 25 mins temp as 39. I had some issues with 3g, i posted on MI forum and half an hour later , i had someone posted on my issue and i resolved the issue. It known problem with Lollipop. Over all two days i had phone in my hand throughout charged it once to 100% took 3.5 hrs. The Phone looks Amazing. I would recommend this phone. Worth every Rupee spent.
0|5|Pros: Design and feel in hand Display Battery Lollipop Cameras Performance Cons: No earphone in box. Have to get lucky in flash sale Only white color for now
0|1|i had purchased mi4i product after choosing long discussion with friends and doing review on site. But it was low expectation than i was thinking. I cant charge the phone more than 10 minit it get warm like hot cup of tea . Secondly I was very disappointed when i started apps like wats up, I hardly made 5 minits chat with my friends it get again warm and warm. i m getting more frustrated when my friends are checking its configuration in setting , it heat at 45 degree. So I request the flipcart to dont sale this phone on your good platform.
1|2|1) Overheating issue, 2) Faulty hardware like I can see light from the right bottom edge of the phone in the dark. 4) Proximity sensor is not working. Dear Flipkart, please take this into serious note and replace all the faulty Mi4i... otherwise it will damage your market value.
0|3|Phone is sleek and its look and feel is good. Only problem i face is the heating issues. When we browse it is getting too hot. Need to fix this problem before i suggest others to buy this phone
0|5|Really words are not coming to express the joy felt by me after using it for 2 days. Really wonderful to have this gadget on your pocket.
0|5|I am using MI4i since may 7, 2015 li'l heating problem when charging and working, which happens with almost all rest everything is just awesome, jdi display with 441 ppi looks more better than iphone 6 , Touch is way smoother than my expectation, screen is scratch resistant.... Octa core processor is working above my expectation Front Camera is amazing, selfies are flawless, You'll fall in love with its front camera Built quality at this rate is more than what I can seek. Overall, best phone in 10-20 k range I'll say GO FOR IT.
0|4|bought on very first sale.I got everything in this phone and im very happy with it expect the heating issue//..
0|5|After using 5 days.. 1. Heating - Not an issue. If any one can high res game this amount is heat is regular. 2. Performance - Over all excellent. When I open the phone it bit laggy but after first update it solves. 3. MIUI - I am impressed by the UI, but still lot more work need to do with the UI. Some apps are not properly working in this UI. But not a problem, this UI gives u lots more option so you don't need download extra utility apps. 4. Display - Just excellent! Sharp, clear, prominent and vibrant. I realy cant imaging this kind of display quality in this price range. I have seen display of Sony ZR with bravia engine,but Mi4i 1000 times better than that. 5. Processor - Heating issue is there, but not a problem, this kind of heating is normal in all smart phone. 6. RAM - UI holding lot more ram, only 750mb -1gb ram free all the time, but who cares, if your apps run smoothly. there is not issue in multitasking. It is my opinion (may be wrong) those apps have lag in this phone those may have compatibility problem with Lolipop, pls wait this may be solved in few more days. 7. Looks - Many of my frnd has different opinion, some says looks like Nokia phones, Sony Xperia, iphone. But my opinion is it looks "SEXY" like a figure zero model and very light weight. 8. Built quality - As the Xaomi said big screen not a big phone, and its true. It is same dimension of Redmi 1s/ Redmi 2/Mi 4. Back cover (white) comes with matt finish, so no prob with that. It does not feel like cheap one. 9. Sound quality - In mic and calling speaker is nice, but loud speaker is not good. But you cant expect better than that in this slim phone and also in this price range. Speaker is better than my previous sony phone. Head Phone sound quality is cool. 10. Camera - 13MP and it is Great one. I love the features of the cam like exposure control, manual focusing etc. Front 5MP and great one. 11.Sensors - Working find, but have some prob with GPS, (Phone prob or App prob i dont know). 12. Battery - 3170mh polymer. Performance of polymer batteries is 100 times better than normal lithium ion. Only 10% down after 45min of game playing in low brightness mood. Thus it is very good. I am disappointing that no head phone available inside the box. Those who need screen guard please visit to MI website and sing in and enjoy the free bees like screen guard.
0|5|nice camera awsm display.. only heating problem and no screen guard avialable atleast xiaomi sent a screen guard with mobile
0|5|If heating problems that you have read about in other reviews of this product make you think twice on whether to go ahead with this purchase or not then let me tell you, sure it does heat up on long video playbacks and high end video games but just like any other regular phone and it is not a big deal at all. Except the memory storage, everything else makes it an excellent buy.
0|4|This Phone Heats Up to 50-60 degrees on 10-15 minutes of gaming of web surfing while making a call our skin get burnt
0|4|I am writing this review after usage of one week. I like this phone. I love this phone................i phone killer Pro. 1. Brilliant Display............. Beauty 2. Feather Touch 3. Good Battery backup............ Moderate use up to 2 day. 4. Good performance and Power efficient Processor. 5. MIUI 6 and Lollipop combination are awesome. 6. Good Connectivity with Network. 7. Rich Look.........strong Build. 8. Update available 9. Front camera is good. Cons. 1. Lagging in rich graphics game 2. Rear camera is average, look like redmi 2
0|5|Just got lucky!!! I registered and sucessfully bought the new Mi4i on the May 7th sale. I have started using the Phone. Feels great, Looks great it is user friendlyamazing camera quality both Photos and Videos. Sound is pretty good.
0|5|comparing with zen2 its the best in look. memory 10gb only available but its OK for a normal user like me....
0|5|Go for it guys. Good battery, awesome camera both front and back, superb display, good speed. Yes like everyone else said there is a heating problem. But its not that it is unbearable. With all these good features one can ignore the heating issue.
0|5|i think mi 4i is very good in its performance and its looks are preety good .I think the white one is very good in looks . The camera clarity is very good . overall the phone is very good
0|3|Excellent Future with respect to price but i got one demerit there is no no external memory solt .rest future is mindblowing.
0|4|Better product ... Better Performance ... But expecting best products in future from Xiaomi. Xiaomi should keep this brand name by providing best customer services also in india and smash all competitors by innovating more like apple... Get guide/support from our legend TATA!!! Verdict : Value for money
0|5|Nice phone in every means. Pros: - Slim and compact design - Best result of 13 MP Camera - Very light weight - Processor is really best - 2 GB RAM is the great stuff - Dual SIM with 4G technology - Great display with highest resolution of 441 ppi. Cons: - No Headset found from packing.
0|3|I would like to admit that I got 2 defective piece of Mi 4i. But after getting 2nd defective piece I had choice of getting Refund as per Flipkart policy. But still I chose to replace my defective phone because I really liked Mi 4i. And I would say it is the best phone in this price range. Though I would deduct 2 stars for getting 2 piece as it suggests lack in Quality Assurance. There are some points that would like to convey. Camera: The camera clicks one of best quality and you can also check article in which Mi 4i camera is compared with S6. It surely has upper hand in HDR mode and clicks better than S6 in HDR mode. The NOISE at night can be tackled by changing the mode to HHT in camera. Sound: If we compare the phone sound to Galaxy S4 it is very less and that’s disappointing as it would be hard to hear ringtone in noisy area but sound in calling and headphone have different story. The quality is excellent. Performance & Heating: I would not lie that phone doesn’t get heated at all but heating in octa core processors is normal when temperature compared to S4 after gaming, Mi 4i had lower temperature than s4. I would suggest changing the mode to performance while gaming to have flawless experience. Games played: Ironman, Dead Trigger and Asphalt 8. Build and Design: I would give 10/10 on phone build and design. It is very handy and light and slim. And it surely gives very premium look unlike other plastic cover phones. I would surely recommend this phone if you’re looking for a phone in this price range.
1|1|awesome phone , mind blowing camera , superb processor , sexy look . No SD slot :( And White color sucks these two makes me give only 4 star otherwise it deserve more than 5
0|3|I received this phone a week ago. Looks absolutely stunning, thanks to the 441 ppi screen. MIUI got updated to lollipop 5.0.2 almost immediately on connecting to WiFi. The phone is a high performance machine. If I start a few apps, some heavy, some light, the phone still leaves only 600-700MB of the 2GB RAM free. That said, the performance was quite fine on some racing games that I tested with. A little bit of lag, but nothing that steals the gaming experience away. There is a bit of heat generated, but I wouldn't start ringing the alarm bells for that. The phone is a bit big for my palm size. I was happy with the one handed use feature that shrinks the screen to a 4.5" or a 3.5" screen, based on my choice. But that still doesn't eliminate the risk of the phone being dropped easily. A bit lesser width would have been good for my hands. The weight is amazingly light. But personally, I would not mind a few grams more with an aluminium back like the Mi 3. The white back is too smooth and offers no grip. Although, not glossy, the combination of the reduced weight and nearly 70mm width makes it really scary to use without (even bulkier) cases/covers. Battery was good for me for 13-14 hour days with moderate wifi, data and call usage. There was one instance in this last week when the phone just rebooted during a call with no heating or any other obvious reason. Personally, I would recommend a Redmi 2 with 2GB RAM and 16GB Memory as a better deal if you have a choice. But this is a very good phone for those who can handle a large device with ease. The price is also very good.
1|5|Expected a phone thats a cheap close of Mi4 but when I unboxed it the phone really amazed me. The build quality is good, infact it doesn't look cheap! UI is a little complicated when u use it first and it runs smoothly. No lags at all till now. The phone did get a bit warm it was used for an hour straight but thats not an issue. Kinda disappointed again as there were no Earphones in the package as i expected it to be there with higher end models. Overall its a good phone. Looks cool! Performs well.. Camera is decent. And the Display is very impressive too. Sunlight Tech adapts to lighting conditions well. If you are looking to buy this phone. Go for i
0|5|Even i was Apprehensive after reading Heater Reviews that i almost decided to go for Moto G or Asus as both were being offered 10% extra with Citibank that at the last minute on the day of Auction decided to go for Mi 4i. Thank God I did not miss this Really wonderful Mobile with all great features, first thing i did after opening the beautiful box was to Update the phone and have been using it continuosly for last three hours even while charging was on and not even the slightest of Heat, MY S 4 gets heated more than this. Beleive me I'm not a game freak but for those who wish to browse internet make calls, a bit of Social Messaging even all Day, This is a Brilliant phone and one not to be missed, will buy another one for sure in the next auction
1|4|I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE AND LIKED VERY MUCH. THIS DISPLAY IS SUPERB. BUT MOBILE SIZE IS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING. IT IS LOOKING LESS THAN 5". SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. IF THIS MOBILE IS 5.5 INCHES IT WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE. CALL QUALITY IS GOOD AND EVEN DATA IS RUNNING FAST. NO CHARGING PROBLEM. IF U CHARGE ONETIME IT WILL GO ON FOR A DAY MINIMUM. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE MOBILE IS HEATING. IT IS GETTING HEATED UP TO 45 DEGREES CELSIUS, I OBSERVED, PARTICULARLY DURING PLAYING GAMES, CHARGING AND BROWSING DATA. WHILE THERE IS NOT HEATING UP PROBLEM. AS THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNCOMMON IN COMING MOBILE AND HEAT IS NOT GOING BEYOND 45. DEFAULT LAUNCHER IS NOT GOOD AND USERFRIENDLY. HENCE I CHANGED LAUNCHER TO 360 LAUNCHER. MEMORY SLOT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS IT WAS MENTIONED, HOWEVER 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY(11GB AVAILABLE FOR USERS) IS SUFFICIENT. MI ACCOUNT IS GIVING ANOTHER 5GB CLOUD STORAGE. GETTING ACCESSORIES IS ANOTHER PROBLEM. EAR PHONE IS NOT BEING GIVEN ALONG WITH MOBILE. YOU HAVE TO BUY OUTSIDE. SUBJECT TO HEATING PROBLEM, I DIDN'T FACE ANY INCONVENIENCE DURING OPERATION LIKE HANGING, LAGGING ETC. OVERALL PERFORMANCE MOBILE IS NICE. YOU CAN ENJOY THE MOBILE. SRINIVAS
0|5|its a very good product worth for money, need to improve on/0ff switch & volume control switch in a smooth finish as its very edged one can cut your finger or torn your shirt pocket as well. its a fantastic product, some times it become very hot.
0|1|The heating is so bad that it is unbearable to make a call...It gets really hot close to the camera side and front top side. I don't run any games at all, even then.I have never experienced anything like this in a phone. Can MI fix this through a software update ? The device is really great..but this issue can be deal breaker any day...
0|5|very good phone in this range. does not hang at all. features are good. completely to my satisfaction.
0|4|Hello guys this review is based on after the usage of 8hrs its really a cool phone with osum specs...no heating prob at all even after heavy usage of 3G as well as on wifi after seeing reviews of heating.. ive cancelled the order.. but took a chance to get this device...then wat??????? finger crossed just update the MIUI of latest version... just go ahead n grab it guys :) ;)
0|5|Awesome phone. For this price you wont get any better phone. Things I like - 1) I wanted a small and handy phone. Its very light to hold and comfortable to use. 2) It looks like a premium phone. 3) Screen and Camera quality are just awesome.Like the best not just for this price range but any price range. Cons: 1) Speaker should be louder. Ringtone isn`t loud enough. Comments: I read the other comments. The phone does not have heating issues. Mine is perfectly fine. However I dont play games on the phone. Just reading, web surfing and texting. Perfect phone and no doubts about it.
0|5|It was a pleasant surprise to receive the phone within 24 hours from the time ordered. It is exceptionally faster delivery. As expected, it is a great value for money product. Thanks Flipkart
0|5|Nice pics are very nice good features easy to handle battery excellent excellent excellent excellent excellent excellent Good Good Good Good v
0|4|I heard saw lots of people complaining about the heat issue. Well, update the phone and it works just great. I had a bit of heating issue too... but after the update it is gone. stock ringtone and msg notification are great. but the MIUI is a RAM hog! 3gb ram should have been there. accessories are missing! too bad and disappointed a bit about that. will continue to write the review after day use.
1|4|its really wow phone, but problem is its quick heating. MI should work on it. we have bought a Bluetooth headset, only due to heating problem.
1|1|Don't know why Xiaomi calling this phone (flagship phone :P), its actually oven, Pricing 13K. Its get extremely heated (Upto 46 degree) even for general use (Charging, texting, calling), forget about using WIFI, Gaming or even Internet browsing. There is a manufacturing defect at the bottom(near charger hole), in dark you can see light emitting. Xiaomi MI3 is a good phone, but this is shit. Please don't get fool by, media or marketing. Its not worth it.
1|5|I am using since last few days very good product, good configeration except no external storage allowed.
0|4|Earlier to it, I have already used MI 4 and was very satisfied with the performance of the phone. The company Xiaomi, in my opinion does not compromise with the quality of the product and it is improving model after model. With the lower specifications then MI4, the overall performance of Mi4i is good enough. Broad specifications are very attractive as it is 5" display, 2GB RAM, 16 GB internal memory (Not expandable) with 13 MP rear camera (dual LED flash), 3120 mAh non removable battery. It is running on MIUI 6 with android lollipop 5.02. As soon as I started the phone, there was an update of 850 MB. After update, the overall interface and feel of the phone beautifully changed. The box packaging is Xiaomi standard and I received the box damaged being looks like it is pressed under some heavy weight but thank god that the phone was safe inside the box. Apart from the device, the box contains one quick charger and one USB cable. A standard sim removal pin is also provided in between the paper work. The built quality is awesome and only having two physical buttons, one for power on/off and another is volume rocker on the right side. The device contains back mono speaker and the micro dual sim compartment is at the left side of the device. Top of the device contains 3.5 mm jack and bottom of the device contains micro USB port and main microphone. The back of the device is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera dual LED flash. The back of the device is non removable unibody covered with sophisticated awesome plastic. Even after plastic back, the device gives a premium feel. It may be easily observed that the design is inspired by iphone 5C. I have chosen white colour but still the front of the device is black on the screen corner portions. As soon as I power on the device, mi logo illuminated and carries to the world of MIUI 6 with lollipop. Look and feel of the MIUI is at a class of its own and gives a feel of iOS. Brightness of the phone is very good and the system does not lag on any operation of the phone. The 13MP camera is not providing quality photos up to the level of my expectations. In the day light the quality of the photos are good but in artificial light or flash light it is not up to the mark. The front camera is 5 MP but I found picture quality of front camera very good in comparison to the rear camera. The phone is having weight of 130 gms even after 3120 mAh battery which is quite comfortable. The battery last for 24 hrs. in a moderate usage of the phone. Still with all the prose and cones of the phone, I would like to state here that it is a value for money at this price point of Rs. 13K.
1|1|Bought the phone on 4th May. Phone while on call heats up alot in few secs. The screen heats up a lot and and makes it uncomfortable to be on call . if you think to buy the phone by specs then please be beware .Flipkart gives excuse of return only when the battery temperatuire is more than 48degree celcius ..but the screen causes really bad heating issues . Feeling cheated by the flipkart :-(
1|1|Please donot buy this product . low camera quality and screen problem and people over flipkart are also not supporting the customers. Heating problem and blur camera No body from flipkart is looking into this , may be they are recovering their lose from this product .. DONOT buy this product
0|4|Hi i ordered the Mobile on 7th May and got the delivery on 8th May : Thanks to flipkart. I was surprised to see that there is NO Headset in the Box. Check the Flipkart website it says what's inside the box In the Box Handset, Charger, USB Cable, User Guide @Flipkart: If your not able to provide the Handset, Please remove from your website.
0|3|The major drawback for Mi4i is heating. It heat up during charging and running heavy applications but when you are on whatsapp or call or any other simple application then also your mobile getting heated like integrated a hot pan into a phone. And many time if your mobile data is activated then without running any applications your mobile getting heated.
0|3|it is a decent cell phone in thi prize range with good performance but it could be better if they would have given support for external storage.
1|5|I'm using MI4 since the day it was launched... Now got my hands on MI4i... Iv already started to envy this phone.. Its slim, Lite.. N luks stunning too.. Not used it yet.. But since I'm an Mi user I believe it should work like it should.. So my verdict - Simply go for it..
0|5|Super Mobile in Height, Weight, Slim & what more your need when you have this kind of a Mobile. Please go through the review its going to be a next I phone in India check this out i am sure i will be using this brand for rest of my life.
1|5|Bought this in the second sale. Great device, excellent screen, awesome experience. Did not encounter any major issue.
1|5|Actually I am a iPhone user, i am impressed with Mi4i stunning display quality comparable with iPhone display. The phone is very opt for normal user and office goer. However for heavy user of game it may not suit. Otherwise the phone is worth for money 5 time cheap than iPhone and giving more or less the same feel.
0|4|Phone is delivered on time, appreciations for the seller and mobile is also good. Worth of money. Best Retailer
0|3|can any one tell me how to overcome from heating problem from MI4I..rest are all feature are okay .. Camera is super and good connectivity with net.. If you play game .. phone response is too good .. but only drawback till date is phone is getting heated very frequenlty
0|4|I am reviewing the mi 4i after using it for 4 days, Pros : i dint find any lag during the 4 days of usage, display is superb, battery back up is also nice, the interface is so good,camera quality is so nice previously i used iphone 4s , i think this mi 4i is no more less to that ,even though it is 5 inch it has very less weight , build quality is ok, no lags while playing games like asphalt 8 . cons : must have provided earphones because it doesnt cost much , heating while charging,speaker volume is less but managable, getting scratches on the screen. overall it is a good phone trust me, the heating problem which is being told by everyone i find it is ok because electronic devics heat ,but hope miui will update the software for the issue
0|5|Before I had mi3. I sold that and purchase Mi4i. Before 2 days I recieved my new Mi4i and after 2 days of usage I can say, It is handsome looking device which is well-built and brilliantly sized for a 5-inch screen. Also its a strong value for money phone. Its compact, slim, lightweight and yet, manages to pack a large battery. Best part in Mi4i compared to Mi3 I found is - It's size and design. One can operate this phone with single hand. Display: Awesome! Camera: Impressive! Both Front and Rear cam gives supperb result even in low light. Battery: Easily run through a full day which seems best for me. It takes only 1 and half hour to get full 100% charge. Great! I read many reviews regarding heating issue for this phone. I am using this phone from last 2 days and I charged it full 100% yesterday and I did not faced any heating issue frankly!!! I have used HTC and Sony Experia too and they were heating lot while charging. Go for this phone if you are looking to upgrade your phone!!! \m/
0|1|I have purchased Mi 4i as on 5th may 2015...when I started to use this phone. I am getting heating issues all time. also I Complaint so many time to flipcart but there are no any updates regarding this issues.
1|1|This is second phone I have purchased of Xiaomi brand... I was very happy with Red Mi 1s but, I am quite disappointed with Mi4i... There is an issue with browser & chrome and no page is getting downloaded, it is getting error "this page could not be loaded" whereas, all apps & google search engine is running fine. Have spoken to solution centre of Xiaomi 3 times in last 24 hours, they asked me to follow some process like Wipe Capche, Giving Permissions and Backup & Reset... Tried everything and it used to work fine for 1 to 2 hours and again the same issue... Don't know what to do now... Goggle play also does not work along with Chrome & Browser
0|5|Dear all, I have handled Mi 4i over two days. Let me explain in detail abt the phone. Pros: 1. Very sharp display quality 2. Very slim and sturdy 3. Good camera both rear and front 4. Very good touch & light response 5. Fast browsing experience 6. Clear audio 7. Faster WiFi & network capturing Mi 4i, Xiaomi is offering you a phone that has premium specs, a great display, good camera, good battery life at an affordable price point. There has been no compromise on the design aspect as well and although it is a 5-inch device, you can easily use it single-handedly for most use cases. The camera is one of the best in this price segment.
0|5|Really good one having gate with best ever display and camera slim yet powerful cannot fetching no heating issues as other reviews but little bit slow performance compare to my recent zenfone 5 overall one of the best in these budget.
0|4|superb design and superb update but camera option is much complecated and it has to be simpler as possible
0|5|This is my 3rd xiaomi purchase...I feel it has the best displays i have ever seen under 25k phones. Battery backup is very good.It goes to 100% in 90 minutes. I was very much confused between mi4i and asus zenfone 2.but the i chose this because it has better display,battery,looks...only con is no external memory card..but 16gb is enough for me......if u want a good phone under 15k, u shoud blindly choose this
0|4|Under the 15,000 Rs, range this phone is the best phone to purchase. Pros: 1. Best Camera 2. UI 3. Good performance 4. Value for Money 5. Lightweight Cons: 1. Only 16GB internal memory not having external memory 2. Heating Issue
0|5|good to buy and very nice mobile for cheap cost and i love it very much good one to afford for a reasonable cost
0|4|Pros: Not so large 5 inch HD display Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 2nd generation processor 2GB RAM Powerful battery Dual standby SIMs with LTE support Good camera Cons: Past heating issues with Snapdragon 615 processor No SD card support No NFC No other memory variant other than 16GB
0|4|Camera quality is excellent , at par with 30k mobiles. product design is awesome ,very sleek and light weight and felt it like using high end phones. Heating is only con apart from that everything sounds outstanding with this specifications.
0|5|This is the phone I was waiting. Fantastic one. Pros : Excellent display Performance is superb due to 2 GB RAM, you will feel it Appearance of the handset is beautiful. Build quality is superb. Not less than any high end smart phones. It is a steal at Rs.12,999/-. Call quality is very good. No distortions. Sun light display feature is a new one in this range phones. Very Good feature. Both the Cameras are too good. Dual 4G sims. Brilliant. 3120mAh battery. It gives decent back up even with usage of high end apps & games. USB OTG. Cons : No SD card slot. I think this draw back will be compensated by USB OTG. But I appreciate Xiaomi for doing away with SD card slot because of disadvantages associated with it like virus, hanging, duplicate sim cards, etc. It is a good move in the long run. When you use high end apps or games and during the charging phone becomes hot, but it is manageable. Overall it is a trend setting handset and is an assault on other brands in this range. Go for it.
1|4|After the motherboard of my one year old Sony Xperia Z1 went off (and when the service center asked 13k to repair it), I thought to purchase a low cost reasonable phone.Bought Mi4i on its first flash sale and I am absolutely loving it. The phone is very light, is sharp and is blazingly fast. Lollipop, ram and processor combo makes it a breeze. The only cons are its sound and average picture quality, but we should not expect everything given its very low price tag. If your budget is below 25k, blindly go for it. If it is just more than that, go for nexus 5. And after that flagships are anyways there, but these days even those don't last long, so take a balanced decision.
0|5|There is no phone in this price segment with brilliant quality. This phone is very handy, light wight , mat finished hard none removable back panel. With full two days of milestone performance battery backup (with 3G and some time wifi used) camera is superb when compare to earlier handset by xiaomi. I just say a BIG yes for this phone. I am very very happy.
0|5|Now to own this i feel to be privileged as i waited for a month not to buy anything else after my mi3 got accidentally malfunctioned. HD display looks very good. Very good cameras, even selfie camera takes stunning photos. Perfect size to handle by one hand. I am a big fan of MIUI customization features which was a strong reason for 2nd buy of MI phone. Unbeatable price. I wish this should have been a 3GB RAM phone.
0|5|this is a great phone made for india .. inspired by india and so its so cool for me... dont go for any other choices in this price you will not get any other phones same as this.... And happy to say i booked the third one today .. and so happy about the flipkart service first one was got in my hand with a touch complaint .. bt it was easily replaced by this guys all over #flipkart and #mi u guys are awsme !!!! keep it up #cheers to the whole #team
0|5|12999 not bad when u get such a good picture quality ,as well as the light sensors are amazing awesome speed not lagging even with heavy graphic games,reliable and trend changing
0|5|I was searching for a Mobile with 2 GB ram with my budget and not too much Big screen Like 5.5 inch. i found was Yu Mobile with 2 GB ram but it was having a lot Heating problem on long Game Plays. This Mob is amazing. Gud Pic Quality. No lag in playing games. It has Sound a bit slow in comparison with other phones. No Heating of battery on playing games. Worth Buy it for 2 GB under 15K.
0|4|Using this mobile from 3rd May and have wonderful experience so far.This is definitely among the best phones in this price range and will also give tough competition to other expensive phones. Pros : Build & Design: Slim,lightweight,good looking and easy to use. Display & Camera: Brilliant HD display.Sharp image Performance :Fast. It is better than my other phone -Samsung Duos Battery lasted for entire day Cons: Does not support external memory card.No Ear phones.Back panel could be made more premium I have not experienced any heating issues as mentioned in some reviews. Launch of such good products in India at attractive prices would be game changer for Mobile industry and good for consumers.
0|4|Got the phone in the first flash sale,was very excited. Phone has excellent display. audio quality is kind of OK. photos are good when objects are really close. speaker is kind of OK too for the price. However phone is lagging at some point and the ram consumption is always about 50 or more. heating is a different issue. Sometime phone heats up for no reason. If they would have used a Intel processor like what they have used in ASUS zenfone 2, I would have been extremely happy with device considering the price I paid for. Zenfone with similar configuration is performing much better than Mi 4i, that's one thing I wanted in this phone. Then it will be 5 star from my end. but sorry...
1|4|flipkart delivery was gud...works on idea 3g...no signal problems so far...but sumtimes it heats up on long calls nd net browsing...hope xiaomi will cum fr help.battery last for a day..overall gud phone for the price.
0|5|its very good mobile and very clear display no log value for money, its total budget mobile, i enjoyed and happy too
0|4|no need to buy any coffee heater.... if u have this phone.... this will also serve as iron if u dont have... greatly heating... all the other things are excellent...!!
0|5|I have been using this phone for the past 4 days. Works very well. But the MIUI is not as good as Samsung's or iOS. The display is awesome - feels like retina. As an average phone user I get around 1.5 days of battery. It did not have any heating issues like others have mentioned in the reviews, but I don't play heavy duty games. The phone is easily worth the money.
0|2|Phone is getting heated instantly and hard to keep it in shirt pocket.Sound quality is very poor also. GUI and touch is good though.
0|5|I am Writing this review after using Xiaomi Mi 4i for 3 Days.... # Battery Life is Perfect...In 3 days I had charged only 2 times...Means Per Charge 1.5 Days. With 3 Hours Music, 3 Hrs. Web Browsing, All most all day Whatsapp,etc.Very Good Battery Backup. # Screen is Superb...Best in Class...You Will Fall in love with Screen. # MIUI 6...Full Customization....Very Smooth. # Front and Back Camera...Result is Commendable. # No lagging. Minor Heating Issue was occur while Playing Heavy games like asphalt 8 etc. But can be ignored look @ Price. # Flipkart Delivery is SuperFast As Usual.
1|5|After using 8 hours of use I will say a class product. Must buy...... Pros 1) Display - 10 2) Camera - 8 3) Build n Design - 9 Con 1) storage 2) Excessive ram usage
0|5|Worth for money. light weight for 5 inch phone. had some heating issue on day 1 but didn't find after that. touch is quiet good. only available in white color for now.. doesn't look nice with black front. overall excellent phone. Go for it...
1|4|First I would like to tell you this is a good phone by look. But I am little disappointed by the fact that Flipkart is showing the Battery as 3120mAH where as battery specification on the Pack is 3030mAH. I received this phone today and let you know after using it..
0|5|It is really a hero on its segment and superbly well built phone with brilliant display.I got this phone on 4th May and since i am running with various experiment after reading comments from fellow users...like heating bar, worst performance, bad camera, cheap battery etc... Frankly speaking since three days i did not find any of them. I am running with few games, day log browsing over WiFi, video recording, photography etc... But yes, there is feel of warm exactly back to rear camera after an hour of use and little warm felt after charge...What i suspect, issues guys are facing might be due to built of handsets..again not sure...if so, flipkart or Xiaomi should check the quality before producing to market. Till now it is nice experience...will update later if found any...
1|4|mobile performance and display everthing is fine but only one dropback was its charging time is too high...when i charged it for half an hour it is charged for only 10 %.
0|5|Good Deal for the price of 13K... Best buy.. Camera quality awesome. 44i ppi awesome display ... seems like high end device. Battery: good cons. only white colour yet... Accessories not available
0|5|This fon launced by Xiaomi is jst for Indians..... Pros: 1. performance is very good, CPU works very fine with no glitch. 2. Long battery life means full day u can use it , its not like 4-5 HD videos n all asphalt n all but still decent back up. 3. Good speed. 4. In this much money camera is outstanding, plus UI is smooth 5. Very light. very nice look, sleek jst 130g weight Cons. 1. Heating issue is there. 2. Coming in White colour only 3.Limited space only 10 GB available for user 4.Sound is a bit less
0|5|I am using it for last 3 days. Phone is excellent no doubt. I read some posts about heating issue which is quite normal and will be there in every smartphone. People have sky high expectation from Mi and that's why they cant take a single small minor negative points about it. Obviously the phone is not the best but IT IS THE BEST IN THIS PRICE RANGE. premium quality atleast better than Samsung's cheap looking handsets and Micromax as well. Don't think so much and get confused for a premium 13 k phone where going out for a movie in the weekend costs 1 k these days.
1|5|Using it for 2 days. Got heated up in the first boot, but surprisingly no real heating issues post it. Multitasking is good. No visible lags. Camera is also good. Front camera is excellent. Go for it!!
0|5|There has been occasional heating issues faced while charging and long-duration gaming, else the device has a great build, feels light in hand, has a great display and the hardware provides smooth performance. Multitasking is above avg and Mid-range gaming is satisfactory. There are other contenders in the market against which mi4i seems to fall short in terms of hardware/pricing (Asus, mircomax etc.) but it seems to be marginal, hence if the pros seem to be desirable, get it. Maybe a 10-11k status would have been a seal deal for the device. Final verdict- A strong mid-range contender
0|4|Pros 1. Lollipop OS 2. Cameras - Front and Back 3. Battery 4. Faster than my Quattro 5. Light weight and easy to handle Cons 1. They said 16 GM ROM - but only 10.5 GB is available to user. No external memory card support 2. only 1 GB RAM is available to user even though they say 2 GM RAM 3. Not sure whether we really need to put addition scratch gaurd. MI says it is not required. No other phones are using this concord glass as far as i know 4. It is getting heated up if u browse 5. Some times it gets stuck even though it has 1.6 GHZ Octo core processers OVerall good phone for 13K...
0|1|I'm using this phone from last 10 days and I'm getting the battery issue with this phone battery will completely discharge in max 6-7 hours without using anything. I did enter the return return request on flip-cart but they are not replace my phone and said me for go to service center. So I'm everyone can understand why we go to service center while we purchase the phone in last 10 days and then what' is the mean of 1 month replacement policy of flip cart this is total fake make fool so please take care before purchase anything from flip cart and xioami. Thanks Manoj
0|4|-Really awesome style & design,compact screen size & light weight,decent improved performance with 2nd gen processor, excellent battery, excellent HD display true 441ppi ,MIUI excellent, there some additional features in camera app also nice... -No heating issue since i used from purchased (Not yet i tested with high end games) Cons -rear camera better than average -low speaker volume -10GB limited storage but we can compromise with OTG (same as iphone 4s 16gb limited). -No NFC I'm satisfied with this mobile with this price.. equivalent to nexus 5 with specs & design same as iphone 5C Verdict : 4 star
0|4|This is my first Mi phone and really happy to own this phone.Mi4i is a great phone and worth for the price tag of 13K considering the specs it has to offer compared to other phones currently in the market at the same price. Feels very much good in hand and the UI is awesome, totally different from the one we usually see on other android phones with stock/custom UI. One point to note here is : This phone is best for those who makes normal phone usage and probably not for extensive game playing(heat generation). After a day usage no issues faced so far. But yes i do agree that phones gets warmer on normal camera usage and then eventually slightly starts heating on heavy usage and while playing games.Am not sure if the heating can affect the smartphone or its performance,but i don't think so the slight heat will pose any problem to the phone. Also the phone gets warmer while charging the phone but its bearable, in fact most of the smartphones do heat/warm up during charging. Overall satisfied with whatever the phone has got to offer. Best buy under 15K. 4 star rating from me, 1 less for not offering micro SD card slot.
0|5|The Phone looks good and the UI is extremely fascinating. Just Love the phone Inside Out. Really a smart buy. There is no match for this phone at this rate. Good Work Xiaomi
0|5|Phone works great and does not hang even when supporting heavy applications. Camera is good and user interface is simple and appropriate. Nice body and great performance.
0|4|Mi4i is a nice phone lite weight feels good nice touch operating system take little time to get use to but its fine, Camera is Very good back n front both n i have check d camera with 15-20k samsung phone Mi4i camera is better. people who are complaining about heating issue yes it heats but only while playing game but we cant complain has we are staying in country where d climate is so hot n summer is d hottest period even if i play game on my PC its heat up very much with all the fans running on in that case its acceptable that phone heat up
0|5|What you & others see this phone as... 1. Cool 2. Sexy 3. Light 4. Bright 5. Slim 6. Beauty 7. Superb 8. High end phone .........................& Honestly, it is. There is a heating issue on the first day but it has come down now. I don't play games but phone's wifi & mobile internet are always on. Heavy gamers may avoid this but others can buy this truly great phone. Battery performance is good. Pls note I use Airtel 4G network.
0|5|display very nice evrthing is very good batary was amazing
1|5|don't go with stupid bad reviews just go for it :) pros- awesome screen quality Evan batter then i phone 6 camera batter then mi 4i mean gazab :) sunlight display with smooth touch cons -no memory card little bit lagging in performance
0|5|First thing First all those saying it heats up to 50 degrees get it exchanged as you must have got a faulty piece as my one is not heating up that much only 43 degress it reached after 30 min of gaming and i was playing asphalt 8 and real racing 3 on it. Now coming to review 1. No lags 2. MIUI interface is very good and fast. 3. Camera is Awesome.Slow Motion Video feature is best of the lot. 4. Smooth Gaming Performance The only con is no expandable memory.So people who love to store too much data have to satisfy themselves in this memory as no expandable memory is there. All in all a great package a must buy phone and should go for it. Don't go through the reviews which say it heats up.
1|5|overall phone quality is good . mi people are giving screen protector for mi 4i . you can get this from mi site and freebies section . cheers!
0|4|I have received it from its first sale and this is the best mobile i ever used in my life. best features with awesome processing speed and the good one its camera...
1|4|However, at times the icons are being blacked out and what you see is either a blackened screen or distorted-dark icons. It happens very often. No heating problem at all!
0|4|My First MI Phone !!! I Love It !!!! Bit heating Issue still worth it , Best phone within 13000 range !!! Great Display , Great Battery Life , Beautiful Design , Super Light etc !!!
0|4|Brilliant experience with mi 4i for first two days. The display is amazingly brilliant. Full HD videos are impeccable and pristine. There is no heating problem with my handset. The only con this phone has is its unexpandable memory. MI UI 6 is buttery smooth.
1|4|Don't know what's up with the orange area of the phone. Calls get disconnected in the middle of conversations,maybe that's just bsnl. Charging issues. Heating issues.Light weight, and good display.Overall not at all bad for 13000 bucks.
1|4|Its just great. Works smooth except when in balanced mode. Rest all is just awesome. If youre searching for a buget device and full HD display, then this is it cause no other phone gives full HD at this price.
0|4|nice Product. lil bit heating prob.. if wifi and call simultaneously going on which i guess is ok....A small issue in my handset screen.. it is displaced a small gap is visible at lower end(can easily see light emitting from there... (when screen is lit in dark room) . overall nice experience in 24 hr's usage.
0|5|After a long search for a 5" display, which is not bulky, I narrowed down to Mi 4i, Pros + 1. Excellent Display. 2. Call clarity is very good. 3. Battery lasts for more than a day with frequent use (Backup is slightly better after 3 days of use). 4. Camera is very good. (But need to adjust the setting for best picks). 5. Smooth touch screen. 6. Clean and tidy Calender app. 7. Slim, Light weight and good looking. 8. Even if it is 5 inch display, it is easy to handle in one hand. 9. Clean UI and well designed notifications. 10. Has e-Compass sensor. Cons - 1. Mild heating issue during first boot and during gaming (Not a deal breaker, as software updates can fix this, as in the case of Redmi). 2. Need to wait for some more time for the IVR functionality update. 3. Online user guide is not yet published. (Many tips and tricks will be unknown until you discover it accidentally). Note: Some free goodies if you register your phone in : mi.com/in/freebies/
0|5|good phone.. build quality is good.. no heating issue ( as i had nokia 920 which heats more compared to dis).. i think its d best on in dis price range... sound is little bit low...
0|5|This phone is better than the best phone for this range.I totally spellbound to see all the new features.Its display is great.I'm loving It...

0|4|Its a best phone in this price, all the features are good, but it does have a heating issue while download/camera use.
0|1|this mobile is full heating even in normal condition. Rear camera is not good Cons: 1. Over heating while charging and talking 2. There is some lag in UI and while accessing camera
0|4|Best Phone for best price Pros Design, Full HD resolution, Full HD video Recording, Back Panel and the touch Cons Heating Issue
0|3|Pros: 1. Value for money 2. Sleek and easy one hand use 3. Good battery backup Negatives: 1. Heating issues even for small multitasking for few min, suggest to use ear phones for longer conversations 2. Felt little lag while accessing various apps 3. Average camera quality mainly for indoor shots 4. Does not ship with ear phones 5. "Ok Google" cannot access microphone hence cannot use google voice feature in this phone
1|4|A very nice product in this price range. Both cameras are ok. but compared to samsung , the screen is little blur....otherwise it s a good product and a speedy delivery from flipkart side. Hats off team flipkart for such a speedy delivery .
0|3|Product delivery by flipkraft is before time, thats good. Phone is good looking, main drawback of the phone is no expandable memory, and other feature wise is good. battery 3120mha is good

0|4|I Just bought a Xiomi 4i Phone for my personal Use and i found its just Superb. So User Friendly phone and with so slim and easy to carry.
0|5|Awesome phone in budget .it is so light weight& attractive look.battery backup is awesome. Using mi4i from the past 2 days now.. . Superb phone, great phone....go for buy....camera of mi 4i is greate.
0|5|Really a very Bad service from Flipkart, Not sure why Xiaomi still believes in Flipkart and gave them to sale it first, Flipkart Pune facility received this product on Friday and it took them 4 days to deliver it to my place in Pune, and even customer care don't know how to talk with the customer. I used one pulse one and S2, one plus one fell in the water so its all dead. I like the phone of s2 size which is perfect to use with one hand, MI 4I is 5 inch but almost perfect to hold and user with one hand. About phone, First Impressions, Perfect 5-inch phone, with awesome display and crisp clear screen MIUI is awesome and new, I don't care if it doesn't have a appdrawer if anyone want it, can download any of the launcher available in the market. Phone heats up?? even one plus one gets heated up while playing games, during long calls or gaming, every phone does heat. so its normal. Camera is perfect for day light, night pics are bit noisy however it is more then fine in this range. Big battery and only 130 gms perfect I must say " Fantastic user interface. Superb speed. Sleek look. Awesome battery back up. Fabulous display clarity" Go for it, a perfect under 15 k, have money buy 1+1.
0|4|1.Looks a very nice phone among 5 inch phones. good camera but not as much clarity as for 13 mp cam's. 2. zooming is a little bit problem , we cant zoom it to the maximum level. 3. video recording is also not so good . 4. for a phone in 13,000 range it is simply rocking . 5. low weight as they mentioned. this is my first experience on the 1st day after my own checking s
0|4|I just received my mi4i on 4th May, though i heard bit about warming up, but on my personal experience it get heated bit but only on charging. But feels like gem in hands, so light, quick response. good camera, and battery power that's also nice.. with normal usage:- 1) 2G - whole day 2) wifi - whole day, 3) 3G - 1 hour 4) calling - 2-3 hour whatsapp - 5-6 hour it last for 17-19 hour which is really good. prons:- 1) awsm config with battery, camera, ram 2) light weight perfectly fits into hands 3) still in budget cons:- -no SD card support but i think still its manageable since u will hav 11 gb left to use it.. -bit warm up when playing high end games for 15-20 mins. overall i really liked this phone.. considering the budget and my requirement.
0|3|EVERY THING IS GOOD ,NICE phone , BUT HEAD PHONE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN BOX EVEN NOT A SCREEN GUARD Was not in box
0|3|purchased mi4i last day good phone good design good display no words BUt BUt BUT great issues phone is not just for looks it has lot to do with 1. phone get heat HEAT like pan while using should be cleared 2.MI gives 2Gb ram more than enough but 75% sucks by MIUI6 pls rectify the issue soon memory, memory should be 32 gb or at least reduce the size what OS consumes ALL THE ABOVE EXCEPT MEMORY CAN BE RECTIFY BY JUST A SOFTWARE UPDATE .WAITING
0|3|Hi.. I have purchased Mi 4I by seeing the hipe created on Flipkart which made the experience worst. Problems : The device hanged up in encryption mode from the last 90 mins & not sure when it completes No proper accessories found even on Flip Kart & Local Markets No Grip on device due to flat back panel ( High chances of dropping / slipping ) As per the device specification its 2 GB RAM but we cannot cleanup the RAM more then 960 MB ( lost more than 1 GB again pulling the device back in performance ) Headset not provided with the device Good Phone is fast as of now ( Not yet installed new apps ) Looks cool & Light weight While using external headsets sound is awesome More themes availability Over all experience is OK, Not that much great as expected. Thanks Siva Aditya
0|5|I just received my phone yesterday. This review is based on my 12 hours usage. It has only prons, no cons :) - Sexy Look In Hand - Speedy Performance - It works as advertised. - Worthy device in 13,000 Rs. - Indeed you will feel a device of 25,000 Rs. After 12 hours of use, I will just say WOWWWWWW.........!!!!!!!
0|1|Do not buy this Phone... The space available here is not enough to describe its flaws... Trust me do not buy
0|5|guys, if 11 GB space available to you is not an issue and if you are not a hardcore gammer then go for this phone i fell it is the best in this price segment and also looks premium
0|5|It is a great phone ever. Everything is only under 13,000/- Great battery life. amazing display. Design is superb.
0|3|review pros nice sleek design awesome screen good call quality no lags good interface battery cons heating while on wifi , charging and 3g even while normal browsing no accessories provided except charger and usb cable more review later
0|3|On The Day of Delivery.... First of all hats off to Flipkart delivery... coming to the phone....received it today on 4 may...the phone is absolutely amazing as Mi has mentioned about its product... on 1 day of use no such hard issue found...on first startup its MIUI 6.4 asked to update for MIUI 6.5....initially it had 50% battery which got down to 18% after 4 hours on average use (watching video and surfing net)...the phone backside is getting a little heated on use which i think is common in all smartphones...no such issue was observed on standby...the processor is not 1.7 Ghz actually it is 1.65 Ghz...it is first day of use....till now for me its is absolute value for money... After 3 Days.... Performance of phone is good as it was at time of delivery, apart from minor lags in checking running apps in settings.....it use to heat on first boot but heating is so much that battery quickly drains on average use (even if the backlight is on)....Xiaomi speaks about good battery...but I think its not so cool in terms of battery backup.....Requsted for replacement after observing the heating and battery issue....Hope it will get overcome... Reducing 5 stars to 3 stars....temporarily
0|5|Overall very nice phone. 1) In white color phone the border looks a bit odd, may be the black phone will be good. 2) Small bugs are there which will fade away with first miui update. Flipkart damn fast delivery hatsoff
1|4|First of all, the feel of the phone is quite beautiful and has a compact sturdy structure. The display is an absolute dream, battery is also fine. Camera is ok. The UI is quite fluid and the absence of bloatware helps. Playing high-end games is not very smooth and the heating is quite annoying. Otg support somewhat softens the the blow of a missing sd-card slot.
0|4|super phone with best system but only memory wise its good cz no expandable storage............other wise it a very good product and the standard delivey makes it in just 2-3 days rather thn 6-7 days
0|4|Superb quality phone at an amazing price. I am an "MI" fan now. Thanks flipkart, 3rd day after flash sale, on 30th - phone was in my hand.Only -ve i see is lack of external memory support. battery, camera,display, weight - all top notch. Will updated after a week.
0|3|its a good product with excellent features but has heating issues which need to be looked into . the product is quite faston speed and have great looks .
0|5|Got my phone delivered yesterday. It is awesome phone with great build quality and compact in size. Dual SIM feature makes it perfect for me. Its 2GB RAM with Octa Core processor is enough for power users. So why wait, just go for it. No heating issues faced by me.
0|3|everything is good in phone its display,camera looks but in terms of performance it lags little bit in antutu benchmark it scored 32000 in performance mode. what i like the most is its battery backup.
0|5|Overall Very Good! Only con is overheating in some cases. Display Is really good! Performance is also satisfying.
0|3|this is truly a flagship phone from the company, but the the phone has its own pros and cons. Pros :) -excellent display (the best) -super camera - stunning sunlight display of camera - excellent design, light weight over all beautiful unibody and sterdy body Cons :( - low sound output - heating issues- heats a lot behind near the camera and front near ear piece and while charging and during extended gaming and usage - low RAM available for usage just 1 gb ram available free from 2 gb where as Lenovo 6000 plus offers 1.4gb from 2 gb available - not the fastest among its peers , Langs a bit which is easily noticeable Overall worth every penny u spent on phone and a value for money deal with the display which u will fall in love with
0|5|t's just awesome... Display Is Super. no Lag issue .ui is super. heating issue is there. but update the mobile its solve i Love This Mobile :)
0|4|good phone at 13 k front camera is good rear not so good multitasking is also excellent not much heat anticipated as other users say max temp. reached is 43 c overall its 7/10
0|5|Plus points: 1) Overall good phone. 2) highly responsive 3) good display 4) decent camera 5) Good build quality Negative points 1) The movie does show some heating issues when used with 4G sim.
0|2|Home, Back, and Menu buttons not working. Tried OS upgrade, Flashing and Factory reset... still no use.
1|5|Received the item. Although a little due to rush of Big Diwali Sale which I can understand. The mobile looks original and is working well. The Bill included in the package was very small paper and it was pasted in Package. Hope they had kept it inside the package as I have now lost it. Hope the printing Invoice will be considered as the bill when I use it if I face any issue.
0|1|Mic Problem in my mi4i . then i replace this mobile, but Flipkart take 20 days for replacement. alredy 5 day waste for Conformation.
1|1|Restarted the device several times a day and Selected Airplane Mode 100 times per day to receive Network signals and Data, Screen didnt survive a 3 feet drop, broken and stopped working, Now Siliguri service centre asking Rs. 5000/- to replace it,Now Imagine, Bye Bye CHEAP CHINA

1|5|in this range with the features of this phone, no one can give. must buy! Mi series is totally unbelievable products.
0|1|After a huge follow up they didn't deliver the product on time and caused to cancel it. I called them (ecart & flipkart both) so many times and all of them were saying different reason behind the delivery. I will never purchase any product from flip kart just because of delivery timeline & irresponsiveness of their customer care executive.
0|5|The phone just uncomparable. I got this in big billion day offer. except some issue finely I got better one. some used phone they delivered first.
1|2|I have purchased MI 4i phone on 22nd of June 2015 now it's not charging at all. I want to return this product its under warranty period.

1|2|I just received the product now. There is no sim tray pin remover, There is no ear phone in the box. And i didnt really like the black shade of the phone
0|1|Hi, If you want to pay and dont use the phone then only go and buy this product, From the day i have bought this phone my life is hell just changing the phone and running behind the service center. Flipkart:- When i got this phone since that time i was complaining about the phone's heating issue but got a advice of upgrading the software update and things will be fine, Which didnt happen. Still since 2 months my phone is with the service center and get a extension date mail from fllpkart that they will solve my problem....which i dont know when that will happen. I get mails from flipkart that tried reaching you over the phone but couldnt reach you....but i dont get any calls from them. xiaomi:- When you can repair your phone then why do you sell your products...in the span of 6 months my phone has been with service center 4 times....first the mother board to replaced then the camera then the PCB and now the battery...and the phone still has warms like a Induction plate...from the day i have this phone my life is a hell..no support from flipkart neither xiaomi service center. xiaomi service center:- people come wait for 4 hrs dont get there phone back and the problem still exist...evey time i go the service center at SG Infotech at Borivali location there is always people fighting for there phone. Once incident when a boy using MI4 was coming from virar was beaten up for shouting in the service center and police had to called.
0|5|Good product and good service from flipkart. Promt delivery, no damage well packed. Over all good
1|1|the day i received this phone i thought its quite nice to have this one but when i started using it then i feel some heating issues even some camera hanging and quality issue as well so i have contact flipkart for change of phone or replace of same but they thinking 47 degree of heating is normal and its not required to be replaced they are saying ...normal phone allowed to be heat around 45-50 degree... no words to say... even they have suggest me to go and check the handset at near service centre they will update your mobile.. and my mobile is already updated with MIUI 7.0.5....but now i am damn disapponted with flipkart and its return policy.....
0|1|Dear All This is the worst phone i have used till date. I purchased through flipkart on 25.05.2015. It is not working properly now. I have visited the authorised service centre in thane, they have taken for repair and on the same day i was called and told that the phone was ok now. But in their presence it was not worked and agian they have taken and informed me that it will take 20 working days. please dont buy this phone. After chinese products are chinese.
0|1|BAD PRODUCT
0|2|Hi, I have purchased Mi 4i from you but the phone that i have received was not good as its sim1 slot not working after that i have got its replacement Mi 4i but this time also the phone got heated and hanged every time and return to home screen. I am very disappointed frim your services. Plz look at this matter.....
1|1|I purchase Mi4i mobile phone through flipkart , the said product is not good there is connectivity issue in this phone .
1|1|Wont recommend this phone. Poor service. has an internal problem which the service center guys refuse to address. Mi service centers are even more depressing than the product. I was a Mi fan but this faulty product and even poorer service has made me lose the loyalty towards this brand. Use the money for some other purpose.
1|1|I am purchase my one of the worst mobile from flipkart last one week I brought this but started our problems Heating, Hanging, Battery Problems and if I order for 30 days replacement benefits no use no one fellows should resolve my problems, so don't purchase this one for our truely and kindly request. And second thing flipkart email option is cheated if sending my problems they didn't call or reply nothing they doing If I ask to call our CC they telling ya new story out server problem pls call 1 hour this is good for our CC support. So buyers pls alert and one again u fix if you purchase any product u ask or u go to showroom and purchase it . This is my harmful message to every my friends......
0|1|Dont make Fake offer's...Cheaters....fakecart.... ordered MI4i 9999..but not deliverd by Fakecart....
0|1|I purchased twice this phone from flipkart but both time faced same issue. When you call somebody or receive call, as call starts screen will permanently get off. You can't ON the screen by pressing power button or volume button. Means you can't cut the call or put phone on loudspeaker or use any other feature during call. When call ends, screen becomes ON automatically. No other issues are there in this phone apart from this major issue. Few of my friends have purchased this phone & they are not facing this issue. There phone is working fine. Kudos to flikart as i returned this twice successfully. It depends on your luck whether you get the defective phone (containing this issue) or not.
0|1|Flipkart gives 30 days replacement warranty but Its useless. when I have complain about my Issue on call, they tell me that please go to the service station and take the confirmation letter then after we will replacing your phone. Then whats the meaning of 30days replacement warranty?If its must be to visit the service status then why you gives the 30 days Replacement warranty? I suggest all to don't buy any item from flipkart. I really unsatisfied from flipkart's service.
0|1|Refund is not give by flipkart.....................beware....
0|1|Cons: 1.Half of the Apps don't work on 3G. It behaves really erratic. even the flipkart app doesn't open up. 2. Flipkart raised its hands on exchange. They need a job-sheet from an authroised Mi service centre which is opened only on working days(u want me to take a leave to get that job-sheet??) 3. HEATTTT!!!damn it..its a frying pan.It can burn even a UFO. Pros: Camera is decent
0|1|Poor Delivery and Poor Customer ..not able to answer the concern and automatically cancelled the delivery recieved product 15-22 days late
0|3|Never had written a review before this. The dropped price of this product from 13 k to 12 k says it all. Replaced the first phone due to sensor problem, which I had purchased. Got the same phone again, because the phone seemed good. But again after using the second phone for a while, one day suddenly it stopped detecting sim cards and then it stuck on the start screen mi logo. But kudos to the flipkart team for their excellent support on this issue and refund on the next day itself after the return for the second time. ( 30 day replacement policy works) With the same money, now I have got moto g3 , and trust me, the phone is awesome and no regrets for buying moto. I will suggest everyone to go for moto than MI, as the old saying goes, " China hai, nahi tikega" Rest, thank you flipkart for your excellent return policy and your customer care support staff.
0|4|I had certain issues regarding delivery but apart from that Flipkart service is worth enjoying. About Mi4i just one word Awesome. You can't get such gadget at such price.
0|3|Over heating and Speaker vibrating (Voice is not clear). Service is not available. Some times process is very slow. Camera is very good.
0|1|HI All, Following are the problem with the Mi4i & Flipkart 1. I could not use internet as it claim to support 4G. But I got 3G and could not use internet. 2. Problem in receiving call: someone calling you & could hear bell ringing but on mobile there is not call 3. Signal prblem 4. Heating Problem: Don't do anything keep in your pocket and it will heat you up - might be Xiomi built this for Winters to keep to warm all the time. 5. Requested for the return but Flipkart denied it - don't know why?. Waiting for further response. Thanks!
0|4|a quality product at this price but had some issues with zooming option thanks to flipkart they got the products refund to me.
0|4|I purchased MI4i recently and I have to say that this one is real value for money. Diwali offer was there for Rs.9999/- and cash back of 10% on SBI cards. Real bonus was that there was exchange offer and I got Rs.1500/- for old Moto E. That was the icing on the cake. Pros : 5 inch 1920x1080 screen Good rear and front cameras(13MP and 5 MP) Snapdragon processor 2 GB RAM Light weight Good battery life Cons : MIUI may not impress all users especially those who have used stock android 16 GB built in memory and not expandable No bundled headphones
1|1|I have ordered this phone 7 days back. It was an urgency but flipkart has taken exam of my patience. I havent received my phone yet. Please flipkart, its humble request to deliver my phone ASAP.
1|2|I bought the Xiaomi mi4i. The phone worked good. I was very satisfied until there happened to be a problem with the LCD screen of my phone. I went to check out the service centre but there was no service centre at the address mentioned. Tried calling the tool-free number . but it says busy all day long. Chat support is also dislabled in the website. Conclusion - no service after sale. Forget quality of service. There is no service at all. So please verify the after sales support before you buy a mi phone. Incase the phone gives problems - God Help!
0|1|screen broken without any hit etc.. charger was not working from starting front camera is not working from starting till now got repaired but again camera came to same position. Typical Chinese quality
0|1|Phone is hanging a lot and also heat a lot after some use. every time i need to clear memory and still its hang a lot even use of simple whats-app and facebook application.
0|5|Nice packing n best product by the seller thank you so much.....
0|4|I placed an order on the company website on the 27-10-2015 @ 08:00 while I was going thru the reviews on Flipkart I got a feeling I did an mistake of placing the order, I planned to cancel the same by the time phone was already shipped I was advised not to take the delivery, as I was not available at home my servant took the delivery. Still I was intending to return I made toss heads retain tails return back. It was heads so I opened the box which was perfectly packed. To my surprise whatever the comments/reviews written proved wrong my phone worked perfectly without any issues I got the update immediately after connecting to Wi-Fi the phone never heated up before, after and during update and is working perfectly as on date. Mi has got 30 days return policy you need to pay the shipping for that. I think people get panicked the moment they notice any problem and are in a hurry to post the reviews, yes we are in India where we do not have consumer protection. This is where we loose the money. Yes refund or replacement is an big and time consuming process. Mi and flipkart shall replace the defective item within 3 to 5 working days, no matter it costs little more price.
0|1|i have very very bad feelings in ur services, dont u guys also not avare of where the products i was ordered... my satisfaction was below 10%
0|4|Received phone ontime even it was festive time. Thanks for delivering on required time
0|1|tHE PHONE IS CONTINUOUSLY CREATING PROBLEM.AFTER USING IT FOR FEW MINUTES EITHER THE PHONE GETS HANGED OR GETS HEATED UP. I HAVE MADE A REPLACEMENT REQUEST FOR THIS ORDER BUT IT WAS REJECTED FOR NO REASON. IT WAS REALY REGRETFUL TO BUY THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART
0|1|I have purchased Mi4i on 30/05/2015 with flipkart. Do not buy any products of Mi. We will not get value for our money. Warranty is not properly covered. Battery life is very bad and charging is not lasting even for 8 hours. Spares are very expensive (Motherboard is Rs.6,500/-) and immediately not available have to wait for 15 days and inspection is chargeable . I could see lot of compliant with the products at the service center.
0|1|flipkart has not any value for its customers.. the flipkart has delivered me a defective mobile... the phone comes with defective sim tray after using phone of 20 days camera not working properly..sound is the worst part of mobile..sim2 automatically removed in phone...the worst experience with mobile from flipkart they checked all their technical aspects of mobile even i had checked this mobile in company's service center they also told me the motherboard is not proper and u should replace it.. but they just refused my return request and now they just ignore even my email... DON'T BUY ANY COSTLY OR YOUR MOST USED DAY TO DAY ITEM...THEY WILL NEVER SEE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND YOU WILL SPOIL UR MONEY AS I DID WITH FLIPKART....
0|1|It took 25 days to deliver the phone, pathetic and more so because it was a gift. Did not expect this from Flipkart.
0|2|Too much delay. Good display. Smoth working. Heating issue....
0|3|I not certified this phone mi4i working is a very slow but smooth screen touch
1|1|i bought this mobile from flipkart on big billion days(17th october, 2015) it was reached me on 22nd october, 2015, exactly after 1month(21st november, 2015) i got a problem on display that some sort of horizontal noisy lines on display which was fully covered my screen , my screen is blurredly visible , i used my device less than 1month as i recieved on(22nd october, 2015) but i am not able to avail the return policy because they stating that your return policy was expired as you bought on the date 17th october,2105, i am asking you people kindly resolve my problem
0|2|I ordered this phone at mt home with two offers, They accepted my order but cancelled the order after 1 day. I was giving this my to my father. This is very bad FLIPKART not expected from you. If you are not able to deliver product with offers given by you then please don't make your customer fool.
1|1|Guys please do not buy this product because large amount of heating problem,sometimes automatically gets switched off. Sometimes problem regarding charging.when contacted with flipkart there are in no position to help me
1|1|Dear Flipkart Team To my dismay i am highly disappointed by your return policy . I was been assured that a pickup of my Mi4i would take place prior to 24th Oct 2015 . Thus i got the message that the product would be picked before 7 Pm the next following day . Someone from the Logistics called me up at 4.30 PM mentioning that he is nearby to my premises .Since i happen to be lawyer and was in the courtroom i reverted the guy mentioning i would be able to attend him only after one hour . The gentleman from the logistic team named Mr Ramsingh (Ph Number-09057905117) responded in non affirmation and suggested me to bring the device to his premise but untill 6 Pm only .Even this proposal was accepted by me . Fortunately i could return just about at 6.00 Pm but then my deadline was over and i was suggested that pick up would take place tomorrow .This was something on which i agreed . The next following day i received the message that my return has been cancelled on MY REQUEST .I have not made any request to cancel my pick or my refund and why would I do so ? . Now when i called the Flipkart team they are desiring me to send the Device to Tamil Nadu all the way from Rajasthan on my own .Only on receipt of which they shall be considering me eligible for any refund . The conduct above narrated from your side is highly derogatory and is being applied with malafide intentions causing me not only loss but humiliation also . This sort of action extended in the manner as narrated above amounts to malafide trade practice as well as deficiency in service which can be agitated in the consumer court very easily ,Therefore in the circumstances by this you are being given a last opportunity to collect the mentioned article with 3 days from my premises and forthwith refund the payment as per the deal failing which i shall have no option but to take the shelter of consumer court consequences whereof you will be responsible with costs Its a malafide trade practice being applied upon me with delibrate intentions to cause loss and harm to me both by you and your agents .
1|5|This phone is ok but with back camera observed redeye in photos.
0|3|I got a budget phone work very smoothly betary is also good .know I am happy
0|5|Awesome phone i loved it ....totaallyyyy crazyyy phone cheerrss
0|1|The Phone i purchased seeing its features but its a damm waste product. features are good camera but what use when there is heating problem .. u just cant keep it ur ears ..The customer service say us to download app and check the temperature say your phone is normal we cant exchange i am saying i have a heating issue ,these all have launched a strategy to show that there is no heating problem .. really dont waste money in buying cheap products .. go for the branded ... a good phone never gets heat ... that too when a unbranded launch a product they shld launch such product where there no complaints .. if u cant produce the product with lower rate y to do u try to produce and make the hard earned money go waste ... please flipkart god sake stop this fake products and mi4i is total waste ... heat heat heat ...
0|2|I bought Mi4i during Diwali sale few weeks back.It looked good when I opened the box, light weight, look and feel was good but as I suspected before ordering this phone - it gets stuck on one application every now and then, facing the same problem while I am writing this review, very disappointed with the product.
0|4|very nice phone and very good price and delivery, this shows we can trust Flipkart on such purchase. Also the status update was exact over the site, so the transparency on status was impressive
0|1|I faced heating issue, device lag and memory issue. So I reset the device to factory settings. After this lock screen is not working, it does not show any notifications in the notification bar, the device stops funtioning , apps do not respond, buttons do not work. I regret buying this useless so called smartphone. I wish we had an option to rate in neagative scale
0|5|I purchased this mobile phone for my mom. Already 3k less from original amount than after exchange of old mobile got more 3k less. Final amount was 7k ...Trust me at this price , full HD phone is awesome.. Thanks to MI and flipkart.. Keep providing this wonderfull offers. Thank you
0|4|Fantastic phone. Excellent performance. Its the really beast
0|1|Camera flash light not working... Still not getting replacement after many request.
1|1|Dear Team, I appreciate your efforts to coordinate we me for my issue. However, I am not satisfied with the product I have received and I am under deep trouble as it has affected my day to day activities & business. Please replace this handset with other brand at the earliest to avoid failure of trust on your services.
1|1|please do not take this mobile. within 6 month this mobile this go to dead mode so guys please care ful............... only 6 month after that mobile mother board is gone...... oge adthaede....!
1|1|overall this handset was good, Returned because was overheating while on slight use of browsing and camera. I am xiaomi user from last 1 year but they should focus more on build quality of the product. camera was awesome, processor was perfect but only heating issue spoiled everything
0|5|Finally got mi4i after 2 replacement. 1st one had a display problem, i.e. the screen was elevated at the left side so the inside bright white coming out from that part. 2nd issue was the device had a calibration issue, i.e. the mobile's compass was showing 30 degree instead of 0 degree when it is placed on ground. Tried to fix it but later come to know that it was a hardware issue. For this issue the screen was auto rotating every time and this is a big issue. Finally , flipkart agrees for a 2nd time replacement. And this time it is all ok. So, when you buy a mi4i dont forget to check the following things: 1. The LED screen is perfectly placed or not. ie, no light is leaking from the sides. 2. The calibration of the phone. To check just tun your compass on and place the device on ground level and see it is showing 0 degree or not, if its not showing replace it immediately. 3. The camera quality. No doubt this phone has a brilliant camera but dont forget to test it as multiple complains are coming regarding faulty camera. To test just go outside of your workplace and click some pictures in normal daylight, try to capture some with full zoom, later check whether it is pixelating or not. The above issues are coming nowadays so please check before you start using it. I am giving the product a 5 star because it is the best phone in this budget(I got it in an exchange offer and it costs 8000) and I think everyone is aware of its pros and cons , so I am not mentioning the same. And dont forget to update MIUI7 and to do a factory reset !
0|4|Awesome product I bought through flipkart and received in good condition
0|5|I love the exchange policy of flipkart, Please implement the same to all the goods................,,,,,,,,,
1|2|I purchases a Mi4i mobile before 1 week but this handset not working properly. I want to replace my mobile with same model.
0|3|I m happy abt product. But not ok with flipkart service. I booked this order on oneday delivery by paying extra amount. But received the item after three days.
0|1|I paid extra money for delivery withon 24hrs but it was delayed. Vendor has mentioned that they tried first attempt but am not available. He has called me and said he cant deliver it but in the system history it was mentioned asif am not available. Worst experience i faced it for the first time
1|1|Please don't but the phone from flipkart.the phone got overheating issue as well as network problem along with unusual screen flickering. When tried to replace or refund during 30 days replacement period the flipkart executives tested the phone through some online app and refused to replace.Flipkart comes with bundles of fake promises and assurances. Please beware of the trap.i am going to file a suit against flipkart in the consumer forum.
1|1|This Phone not Well in all the times some times automatically turn off and on battery also poor , sturcking plublem flip kart 30 days replace promise is false pramise thay are not provideing repalce and refund , iam requsted return product in 10 times a month
1|1|recently purchased Mi4i, its getting too much heat. there is no proper response from Flipkart, Beware of Mi4i and Flipkart before you buying read *terms and conditions
0|4|once again W S Retail kept their Promise. Good Packing, and i got a 4G free Airtel SIM along with the product.
0|1|I am facing the same issue second time within 2 months. I ordered Lenovo A6000 plus (big billion sales LoL) and Mi4i ( Diwali offer) The game goes like, 1.First they offer some discount with exchange of used mobile, once customer places the order they cancel the order or they sent to the customer destination hub and their courier partner cancels saying customer rejected the order without contacting and notifying the customer. 2.If the customer contact the customer care through mail and via phone ( both conflicts in promises) they say simply sorrys they offer they useless apologies which worth nothing. Customer care executives tells you they anyway deliver the same product and mail comes to you stating they already cancelled the order , so if you want the same product make a fresh order asking the order ID. 3.If you place the fresh order for current price , and inform them the order number which is useless again. The sent the mail you have to pay the adjusted old price. You feel comfortable. 4. At the time of fresh order delivery the courier partner insists you to pay the old price only , if you argue based on customer care executive mail. They will tell you they don’t know anything and asks you to pay the current price or reject it. I faced this two times as I said , 1. Order ID : OD204177079275943000 Item: Lenovo A6000 Plus, 2. Order number OD204390703206320000. Product: Mi4i exchange Executives contacted: Kavya G,Kavitha,Kande Naresh and senior executive from banglore office Rakesh
0|1|I had read lot of reviews and did not buy this phone for a long time. After hearing that the heating issue was resolved after new software upgrade, i purchased the phone. Phone is not safe to use as it will definitely heat up after upgrades and it will cause burns on your ear. I am even getting bad headaches after using the phone for more than 10 mins. Phone heats up even in factory reset mode while you are speaking to some for just 10 mins. I hope this feedback will help other buyers.
0|4|Hi All, This phone is amazing. No doubts about it. Camera is exceptional. People who would like to use this phone to access Corporate Emails or Official stuff, please DO NOT but this phone at all. There is no ENCRYPTION available in this phone. Option of Encryption is there but you cannot encrypt this phone due to Google's Policy restrictions. Google was supposed to release Lollipop with Encryption by default but they have not done it. Any of the phones with Lollipop will have no encryption even if you upgrade the Firmware which in my case has already been done. I have upgraded the Firmware to MIUI 7.0.3.0 but there is no Encryption at all and I am not in a position to use it for official purposes. This is the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 and will be returning the phone, if possible.
1|1|Issue with the data connectivity. its not working properly.. goes off consistently. I dont recommend this product.. please stay away.. very very horrible experience
1|1|Already used product sending, hanging issues and charger is not working. But flipkart & ws retail, 30days guarantee is greate. He is approved the Replacement hand to hand
0|1|Mobile is heating while taking calls.Leave about playing games and other things.Technical team also not responding properly.
1|1|I am a regular customer purchasing products from flipkart for quite sometime. have purchased 2 phones before and this was my third phone(mi 4i) bought in last six month from flipkart. All was fine until I made this purchase.from the day i received the product I have been facing heating issue in this phone 15 mins of usage and phone gets difficult to hold due to heat makes ur finger burn. I called up flipkart helpline and the first reply to heating complain was 45 C degrees is not abnormal.second set of instruction- Try uninstalling apps and turn of data. Smartphone coming with instructions of limited use.Then why buy at all. Next i requested them to lodge my complaint at least Now in name of complain flipkart asked me to install smart check app performed a quick 2 min test (didn't share any test result) and declared that phone is perfectly fine. at that time CPU temp app was showing temp of 45 to 48 degrees.The hands were feeling as if touched hot pot. Now i have been told to visit xiomi centre. It seems the 30 day replacement /return policy of flipkart is just an advertisement. For any one thinking of buying xiomi Mi4i please buy only if you can bear xtreme heating up.The phone just heats up in 15 min of usage. Otherwise the performance is decent but one big negative point of heating up makes it unusable. It seems buying with flipkart is playing poker you enjoy until u r lucky was lucky with my first two purchases so no issues no complains and the moment i got a product requiring some support from flipkart was nowhere to be seen.More disappointed with flipkart's response and their attitude rather than phone heating up. I would prefer spending few more bucks and buy from somewhere else but surely not from flipkart in future. I am not here to review the product or its defects as I have checked that xiomi mi 4i is a product which heats up a lot wish I would have done my homework before making the purchase.It feels like I have burned my money in purchasing this product.I also exchanged old product for mere sum of money which was in better condition that this crap i purchased. last experience- buying with flipkart is finding your luck if u get a good product u r lucky but if its defective you probably have no rescue. For people looking for xiomi Mi4i review this is a frying pan can help u boil water maybe and save LPG bills.apart from that no major issues at this price. FIVE stars for flipkarts return cheat policy!
0|1|Very bad phone....at this range I am not satisfied from this phone .. Phone is hanging tooo much and also some apps not working .. Running apps stopped unfortunately..
1|1|Mi4i Total waste of money. This phone OVERHEATS, HANGS, internet does not work on the phone. Connectivity issues...U name it...it has the problem. 15k in the Drain. for this stupid phone. Please do not buy these CHINESE PHONES. Else you will land up LOOSING THE PHONE AND THE MONEY. I DONT EVEN HAVE A REPLACEMENT from FLIPKART ON THIS.
0|5|Nice Mobile Mi4i, Very fast Flipkart delivery service. Very active customer support. Product quality is very good, Flipkart packing is so good. Received product as order and very safe. Must buy from Flipkart. Flipkart --> Online Shopping Ka Guru...
0|1|the product has defective sensor, lots of disturbances during calls and till date no response from Flipkart
0|5|i got it @7200 after exchanging my mmx turbo (got it for 21000/ two years back and exchanged for 2000/- :-(..... pros: good configuration. nice screen and techs. Charges very quickly cons: battery dies very quickly on data usage and almost similar to mmx turbo. on only phone calls it is giving a solid two days backup. we may run two movies successfully.. no regrets.. for 7k what better I can get?
0|4|dear flipkart, i noticed that above rs.10000, mobile phones are not deliverable in some pincode/ area. if this limit can be extended upto rs.20000. this will be better for some customer who wants to buy above rs.10000 smartphones. please carefully go through this and try to solve it. thanks & regards
0|3|Extremely irritating and bad services and support from flipkart, when requested for return due to storage of mi4i issue and compatibility with some applications. Call centre services are extremely poor. Returning policy is so bad that can not be compared with any other site. MI4i is good handset may be given 2.5 rating but do not take from flipkart
0|1|this cell no ins tel in any app.fist goggle ply story not ins tel... no good,,,so no response this cell ,,,, no retrain only replace wt this is not good product pleas think after perches
1|1|i purchased mi4i and within a week its dead now no activity atall (not charging, no power on) i sheduled a replacement please ws retail provide me a new phone not a refurbished
0|1|I ordered mi4i on 17 Sep got it on 27 but heat after 5 min camera usage and camera is giving blur and noisy image..on replacing this piece flipkart gave me another piece...but second piece has more worst camera than first..they waste my big billion day...money and time ...but after i complaint again they gave me my money back.

PLZ DONT BUY THIS #wedeservebetterphone
1|4|how to exchange from old to new and what is the cost after exchange can it be same for all mi phones are it should be vary from phone to phone
0|1|The Courier guy went back after I asked him to open the box before payment. What a cheap service...fake Flipkart...in two occasion they delivered a used, second hand phone and my request for exchange was denied. Stop fooling people, First show the stuffs and take the payment later. Sychs!!!
0|1|Very frustrated from the Flipkart service !st I have received the Faulty Mobile of Xioami Mi4i that has Red line on screen. And i Raise replacement for that and What i received a Seal Opened mobile Phone Which restarts automatically after some time. I cant believe this. This is really horrible. After all How Can you send the Opened faulty device on replacement. It is Harassment to the customer.It is really not acceptable.
0|1|What a poor customer support, very bad experience with last order Very poor customer service and return policies. Simply like cheated. Service support just wasting time doing nothing. I was very happy for a last year since i don't get any issues in product. But facing some issues with the last product so I requesting to take ,that return. But I am getting fool for 1 week and at the end said sorry can't take return. So poor flipkart. Not expecting from you this. You make this deal so worst. I should be quit flipkart forever now.
0|1|In my deptt. all my fellows purchase this mobile and while looking at their mobile, I ordered this one. So far, product appear to be good from reviews and glimpse. Will give my views after using the product at my end. Today on 13.11.2015, the courier boy came to give the delivery of my mobile MI 4i. It was under replacement and the courier boy asked for accessory (mobile charger) that I did not bring at the location of delivery. Consequently, he refused to give the delivery and went away with the product. I would like to mention here that in the mail from the flipkart side, they did not mention that accessory should be kept ready with the replacement and it caused me a lot of embarrassement.Got disappointed, due to the mistake on the part of flipkart only.
0|5|Recently I have Purchased Xiaomi Mi 4i From Flipkart WS Retail, Bangalore the phone is awesome and there no issues about this phone... with flat Rs. 3,000 off on flipkart's recent occasion named " The Big Billion Days " in about Rs. 9,999 never mind about WS Retail seller , it is one of the best seller on flipkart.com
0|5|Using dis one since 04 months.....full paisa vasool...grab it.
0|1|Call quality very poor. Screen blinks with a blue light while playing videos. Heating issues. Tried all ringtones but sound quality is so poor in max volume too. While listening to music on headphones no alert of call or messages. While opening phone if u keep screen lock it shows a error. Smilarly so many other bugs which is not adressed and they send it to market. Such a waste phone for such a price. I would never suggest this phone to anyone.
0|4|Fast reliable pretty and customize-able. Only thing i would say it lacks is expandable storage.rest is a genius product.
0|5|I purchase this product and i receive in 3 days the product is very good and there is no heating problem but we can not expand the memory..
1|4|Seriously, if you are looking for a decent phone, Mi4i is worth giving a shot. I dont wanna go through the specs, but just wanna my personal experience. Sorry I will be taking it a bit too long, but I love to read genuine reviews for the products and I hope this review will help someone who wants to know about this phone. I bought 2 of them on big billion day, although the delivery was very late, when I received the phone, it was worth it. The display, design and weight will blow your mind off in the first 10 mins you switch it on. And then when the phone is ready to rock, the camera will take the rest of your breath. Not even you, everyone who sees it in your hand, will definitely be stunned, and believe me, it will get you a good attention compared to the other phones in price range like lenovo k3 note (which is damn big and boring design). The Mi4i is very handy and sleek and has the perfect size of an optimum phone. And my 2nd phone has an defect in the rear camera which I realized after a week after using it, and flipkart executives helped me through it. The thing is, you need to calm and patient when you get a defective product, rather than shouting on the flipkart executives, and thats what I did all the time and have successfully replaced all the defective products I got from flipkart. Now I have both the phones working fine. YES, there is an issue with heating, but thats very common with the high end processors in this low price range. All you need to do is to update the UI and optimize the usage of your apps by using battery doctor or other apps, I guarantee that you will definitely find a drop in your heating problem and will also increase the battery life. Talking about the camera, this is seriously the best in the price range of 9K, though I feel the performance as well as the camera has been degraded when compared to the Mi4i which was sold in the 1st flash sale. I got Antutu score of around 25000, actually which should be 36-37000, but thats not a reason to not own this phone. Obviously a day to day normal person will not use the all the cores, graphics and test the best the phone can give. So the bottom line is, at 9000/- price, you cant say no to this, as no phone will give you these many features as a Full HD display, brilliant touch experience, a detailed camera and the most important thing, the looks to get you not stop staring at it. Thanks for reading..!!! Hope it helped to make your buy a better experience..
1|1|firstly it still have heating issue while u open camera nd start using for just 5 min with continuous clicking it guarentee heat upto 50 centigrade even i return it with this issues daaa flipkart agency rejected for 2 times of my return nd still want to return my mobile nd still they are rejecting
0|5|my first completed order through flipkart, very first service, as i have heard from others, felt it myself. very quick and very good service by flipkart/ WS Retail. about mobile- good one. ratings 4.5 out of 5
1|1|This phone is a heater. can burn your hand. i ordered this phone on dated 17 oct and got on 3 nov 2015. sooooo late. now i want to return it and flipkart is not answering. if flipkart will not take it back it will be my last item from flipkart.

And plz don not buy From FlipKart online.. Very Bad Customer Service From FlipKart
0|1|Flipkart shipped phone with defective receiver. Not giving replacement as their software test tool says receiver is ok. But when i call i hear annoying vibrations in the receiver. I have to run around service center now. Also it heats a lot. I recommend not to buy this phone, its waste of money. Poor service from flipkart, selling defective and non worthy products.
0|1|Hate flipcart all my product are useless mi 4i & k3 note creat problem in first week both
1|4|I have purchased this phone at price 9999 on Diwali sale and it is a nice product from Xiaomi , the bad thing of this phone is, it is heating and high SAR value. Pros: Great Display Good looking High Speed 4G and Wifi Battery Backup User Interference(MIUI) Good Camera quality Cons: Heating So much No headset on the box Buttons seems to be worst quality Light sensor not that sensitive High SAR value Lastly for Flipkart , The service is very bad, and courier boy came to me with a bicycle , delhivery courier is the worst courier service i have ever seen.
0|5|Offer is Awesome and Item is double Awesome.Offer is Awesome and Item is double Awesome.Offer is Awesome and Item is double Awesome.
0|1|Flipkart delivered me a defective product and...........then they make a lots of argue to me that they can't replace it ..I have to go to mi care ....etc.I am telling you guys don't buy from Flipkart. Tjlhere ate lots of dealers on net.
1|1|I have purchased Mi 4I From Seller: WS Retail Date: Thu, 15th Oct'15 . After 10 day Some time device's Sensor is not working. I am not happy with MI 4i.
1|1|i have ordered mi 4i on 27 Oct and got it on promised date but it was faulty.No capacitive button were working . I have requested for replacement but its still stucked in somewhere in Bilaspur & its also an expected place. No one know when it would be replaced. i Want it to be replced by 6th any how
0|4|Thank you Flipkart for better assistance :) Thank you for Refund. Device was very impressive but had some techniacal issues .
0|1|Device gets extremely hot with 5 minutes and network problem, got a complete defective unit from flipkart. My friend are also using the same device with no issue. same problem even after update. I call called flipkart several times, they told me so called trouble shooting steps which i already did. And refused to replace my defective unit. Flipkart's 30 days replacement is a hoax. Do not expect any any after sale service from them. Once they get your money they are done. Really disappointing.
0|2|This Phone has Heating problem... I am buying a phone from flipkart..within 4days from buying my phone was automatically shutdown & do not start... This phone is not fast as 2GB RAM... If u download more application in this phone ,it will slow like 746mb RAM.. But camera & display is too good.
0|1|Rear camera is very poor and Internet is not working in this phone. If I create this phone as wifi hotspot and using this phone's internet in other phone then its working. Flipkart customer care executives are saying to visit to service center. The 30 days replacement service is fake. Please don't buy anything from flipkart. it has very very bad service.
0|1|I received this phone on October 31 and now I am writing this review after 3 days usage of Mi4i. This review is 100% true and is purely based on my own experience. All of the features included in this phone is really awesome.But the worst & unavoidable thing is that this phone heats up very quickly like anything else.The heat coming out is really horrible & unbearable even to hold it in my hand. So we can imagine the situation where we need to hold it near our ear. I bought this phone after reading most of the reviews which suggests that the heating issue will be solved after updating the phone to the latest version of update.But I promise you that it keeps on heating up even after it is updated.. So In short, I beg you not to purchase this phone as It does not serves the basic purpose of a phone.It does not allow us to make phone call as the heat coming out is unbearable.So make sure you are taking a wise decision & spend your money carefully & only on a product that worth it.... Thankyou... Yours Faithfully Vipin Sekher
1|1|Received a faulty mi4i yesterday that reboots automatically.... A piece of advice for Flipkart management, if you are selling a product at a discount make sure the product is not faulty, else people will loose faith in online shopping.
0|5|I have bought this phone from Flipkart couple of weeks ago...I am amazed by the performance of this phone, The best phone in this price range..!!! superb camera, superb call quality, stunning display, & last but not the least sleek design..!! If u have used reknowned branded phones before then u must try this one, U will not be disappointed,I Assure u..!!
1|1|After system update , the device I showed MAJOR issue "its mobile data does not work with 2G". Browser can not load any page even when "internet connection testing" says internet is working fine. VERY IMPORTANT - Just google "Mi4i mobile data not working" , one can find lot of complaints. Flipkart service centre also not acting as per request. Flipkart calls back at random time to check the mobile issue.They expect to connect mobile remotely using their "smart check app". Flipkart return policy for this problem statement is bad because it expects user to install app , run that app using wifi ("to be ready with wifi connection when ever they call is a challenge in itself"). How it is going to be possible?????? ALSO Comedy part is that Flipkarts "smrtChk" app checks all features other than my problem statement. Based on that, Flipkart claims that mobile is fine... hahahaha... VERY BAD WAS the response from XIOMI service center.In fact There was no response from XIOMI service centre. After so much of follow up, Flipkart is at least standing by its policy of 30 days return. Thanks for that but I had to spend lot of energy to convience. I concluded that its better to purchase mobile from other known brands who have strong customer support and better record.
0|3|Flipkart took 18 days to deliver the product which pissed me off a lot but the product delivered was up too the mark and lived upto my expectation and worth the money i spent.
0|2|It is not connecting to Mobile data and WIFI Sometimes it is not detecting the signal even though signal strength is more Earlier i used reboot the mobile to connect to internet but now it is not connecting even though i rebooted
0|1|I have bought this phone a week ago picture quality & other feature of the phone is good however the speaker of the phone is not up to mark neither the call voice is clear nor the audio & above this after sales service is pathetic I had made three replacement request back to back every time customer care care executive call & ask me update some thing or the other but problem still persist. I would say this one month replacement grantee of the flip kart is to making fool of the customer.
0|1|Bought this Phone in May. Worked fine for a couple of weeks. After two weeks started giving loads of problems. First the memory would get full with logs in the ramdump folder. It became a daily routine to delete the logs to free up memory. logging ticket with Mi did not help nor posting the issue in the Mi4i forum. Found out from the Mi4i forum that this is a common problem reported by many users and the company is silent about this complaint - so much for customer support !!! Another issues is that of the phone loosing mobile coverage. It became so bad that it would not work if taken anywhere outside a specified area. Again, absolutely no help from the company. Finally, i decided to move on to another phone. So, the phone I bought by paying Rs. 12,999/- became a chinese junk in 4 months. Will never touch a Xaomi product.
1|2|My order was supposed to be delivered on 26th Oct and i received it on Nov 1st .. There was no proper reason stated for the delay . The team rescheduled the date to 30th october and failed to deliver for second time.
0|2|earphone is missing from the box... This review is concerned with flipkart and not with xaomi.... the earphone which should come with phone is missing... Dint expect this from flipkart.... Please dont let down the hardwork of Sachin and Binny.
0|3|please check if the mi service center is in your city before buying this product. if any issues arises in future they would request you to walk in with the product. i ordered the phone and got a faulty charger with it even after falling in 30 day replacement gurantee i was told by flipkart that the seller is refusing to replace charger and the solution flipkart offered me is either i can travel from nagpur to nearest mi center i.e. mumbai or pune and get my charger replaced or i can opt for a Rs. 500 refund as a goodwill gesture which would be only applicable on WS retail product. If you get the product in good condition its good to use and a fun experience but the phone hangs when used with local chargers
1|1|The phone is getting over heat on playing games or on phone calls. Flipkart has not responded properly on replacement request.
1|1|Don't buy MI 4I. Flipkart has cheated me . After one day I can not play video , I can not call , I can not receive the call because I am not getting any voice ,battery backup is very poor . It looks like flipkart has started selling used product. Flipkart is the biggest cheater because now they become successful so they started cheating customer. Suggestion to buyer please do not buy any electronic product from Flipkart. You don't even deserve 1 rating . Now I got to know that they show offer because they sell old product. I will report this to consumer court today.
0|1|I thought this was a good phone after reading the reviews. But when I bought it the screen was having few black spots from inside. And it heats up very badly when you get connected to WIFI. Also, I downloaded the update pack which can't be upgraded to the phone - it shows that the zip file downloaded is corrupted. When I asked for return and replacement the Customer Care Executive carelessly tells to run an app (Which is supposed to clear all the problems) and closes the return request - even after me telling them not to close it. Flipkart please improve the service. If a certified buyer tells that there is a problem please accept with no questions asked as others in the market says.
0|3|I faced network problems with this Mi 4i. I am getting very poor 3g signal with this phone. It is not due to carrier (sim), since I'm able to get good signal for the same sim from the same place using my Moto E which I'm using currently. So I am planning to return the device as I'm not able to use 3g efficiently with it while I'm still able to browse happily with my Moto E. I have also observed that the the internet keeps going on and off with this mobile. Hope Flipkart will understand the issue and refund the money. I will post the experience with flipkart once my issue is resolved.
1|1|hi...this phone is good however i received defected phone from flipkart..there is software issue in my phone and i am not able to receive call on this mi4i due to software issue which is very basic feature...
1|1|I ordered my product on 16th oct 2015 and today is 30th oct 2015, I haven't received my order yet . when asked flipkart the reason for delay they say that its due to high demands currently. If they cannot handle these high demands they shouldn't promise quick delivery. Flipkart's mission and vision is very wrong. I recommend all to purchase from alternative sites who deliver quick even during high demands. Pathetic delivery service. Very upset with the delay.
0|1|During Big billion day, I have ordered this phone, flipkart committed to deliver dis by 21st oct 15 but received on 28th oct 15 ... Very poor service, totally disappointed with dis..
0|3|Phone, specs,Interface everything is pretty good, but it is heating up without any usage. Flipkart,Will there be any replacement ?
0|1|Pathetic after sales service. Phone is good but after sales service is very bad. Service center's do not pick up calls. Asks for keeping phone for 20-25 days. No response of mails sent to service mail id. No escalation matrix.
0|1|DO NOT BUY! STAY AWAY! HUGE HEATING PROBLEM Flipkart and Xiomi think it is ok to sell a phone that has a display temperature of 40 oC? How are you suppose to keep that near your face for more than 2 mins. It heats up bad and flipkart did not want to take it back even when I explained that it is impossible to use. As for the manufacturer, they consider normal temperature of display to be 40-50 oC. who uses a phone that hot on your face???? DO NOT BUY DUE TO HORRIBLE RETURN POLICY OF FLIPKART
0|2|Phone not yet started.... earphones are missing in the pack... so less rating... product seems to be new...
0|5|best phone i have received at this price .only issue is of space is only 16 gb no expendable....................
0|4|whether sale of xiaomi mi4i in 32 GB varient is permanently discontinued or not. I want to purchase it but due to non availability, I can't purchase it, therefore please arrange to make it available at the earliest possible.
0|1|Placed an order on big billion day 17 Oct 2015, Order could not deliver due some technical issue and flipkart customer care executive are giving wrong information on same issue.
1|1|I have bought Mi4i phone in month of May 2015 and since inception of its usage I had some or other problem, however by now Oct 2015, i.e., before six months of its usage it got totally dead, phone got stuck at re-boot, and continuously it get re-start and stuck. Another problem was "can't connect to camera" error message when I tried to open the camera. When I approached to the authorized servicing center to report the problem, they have diagnosed and mentioned to replace the motherboard, and quoted the price of 8500/- for replacement of motherboard, I was told motherboard replacement is not covered under warranty. Warranty should cover all these problems, they are cheating, they dupe the public with false commitment. I request you all never get tempt with low price offers, and dont' trust Chinese brand, otherwise you will be trapped. I want to ask to the responsible authority who are selling Mi4i, why don't they take the responsibility of fix the problems and adhering to the warranty claims. Please stop doing so. I want this handset to be mend under warranty.
1|1|Front camera is not working of MY MI4i handset, I have purchase this few days back ... Pls help me for this issue will be clear ASAP. I have contact to Flipkart Customor care they said our server not working pls call us after some time Please help for the same.
0|2|I replaced MI4I two times due to Connectivity problem, Sensing problem & heating problem. secondly :- few flipkart representative is not ready to cooperate on our problem, behaving very rudely & not ready to replace the device. Third :- MI4I customer care center will not pick your call for your troubleshooting specially Baroda & Surat. Number taken from Flipkart representative & I doubt on Customer care center is actually available or not.
0|3|the battery is non removable, from where i can purchase it. please help me. .....................................................................................................................
0|1|I've received my phone just 26hours back from writing this review. The phone gets heated up even with 10mins of normal usage i.e on placing a call, on using camera etc. I can feel the hot screen against my ears and after 3-5mins or so it becomes quite uncomfortable to hold the phone against the face. Called up Flipkart customer care and they asked me to install an app which runs some tests and submit a report to Flipkart. I dont get to see it. According to the report the phone is fine and Flipkart customer care representative cancels my return request. Pls dont buy this phone or even if you buy it pls dont buy it from flipkart because their return policy is a fraud. they will not refund or return the phone until their app shows high temperature in a report which is not visible to customer. If you feel a need to buy it from flipkart pls mail me and i will provide the details which will help you from getting cheated by Flipkart!!! This is my final purchase from flipkart and i will never buy anything no matter how discounted it is from flipkart.
0|1|Hi guys, dont buy this phone as it is the worst phone i have ever seen. i bought 2 mi4i from flipkart out of two, one got dead suddenly after a month and second one my brother use 2 months, after 2 months it suddenly started giving network related issue. no service providers SIM card was working with mi4i. it was showing 'emergency calls' for al the SIM's ever after checking all settings and even i had done hard reset/factory reset of device still it was not working. It looks only attractive but hardly you can use it for a month only after that it starts giving sudden shocks and you are in trouble with your investment in mi4i. So please dont buy this product, simply chinese, "Chale to Chand tak nahi to Raat tak". loss of 26K to me bcoz of mi4i. mi pls dont sell your worst stuff here. You have a good options in market rather than buying this you can go for any other phone like Honor, moto G*, moto x*, lenovo ** etc.
0|1|I didn't expect this much delay of the product. Max of 10 days will be acceptable but it is taking almost 3 weeks for delivery. Ridiculous.
1|1|If want to make an Omelette without fire this is best the best device. Worst service. over heating, fast draining of charge. flipkart not addressing the complaint. dissatisfied.
0|1|please dont purchase mi4i mibile. this is fake product and Flipkart Retuen policy is very bad Xiomi Mi4i mobile is very heating and hanging problem and Application not working proper
0|2|Hi, After purchase of MI 4i, i have updated my phone with latest 800MB update but still my phone is heating. Can someone please help me or suggest what i need to do to overcome with this problem.
0|1|i order the Mi4i on 15 oct15. phone was delivered on 24th oct. After coming back from office i start the phone and checked the feature and UI. while entering the wifi password i figured out that the some key's are not working on the keyboard. Now This Phone is just a waste for me. i called flipkart and requested replacement. Flipkart accepted my request and now they will send a another machine.i Guess flipkart Knows about such hardware issues about the phone that's way they offers 30 days replacement. without replacement policy this phone will be a waste for me. Hope this time a got a defect free phone.

0|1|I bought Mi4i on 23 July via flip kart (OD303193446934302200). the charger circuit stopped working with in 2 months which i got it repaired (took 3 weeks) at Xaomi service centre vashi . Now the speaker of the phone is spoiled. I have hardly been able to use this phone which is still under warranty. and Xiaomi has no refund policy.. this is pathetic..
0|1|Its not worth....mobile hangs and sound is worst you cant hear the voice speaker is disgusting.....Please make sure go through the review and decide
1|4|Do they give power bank in kit ?? I didint find it so ples somebody help ? What else it contain ? How can I call retailer ?
0|5|please sir 22 oct order is complete ,my order is very important lease complete my order delivery on 22 oct
0|3|Please again i want to order same product.I don't know what the reason for cancellation.I didn't get any call from your side for cancellation or order review. so please revert me asap. Please do the needful.
0|1|i placed an Mi4i on oct16-2015. it has been 3 days and the product is yet to be shipped from the seller.Really disgusting delivery process. is it just because the product is bought under the BIG BILLION /DISCOUNT scheme ,making this delay. I even called FLIPKART customer care requesting them for a faster delivery with extra money. but disappointed to learn that no such premium services are available. If flipkart reads this survey,then my order ID is OD104187020727611000
0|1|this time flipkart did really shameful thing. in ordered this product on big billion sale fulfilling all the formalities but it cancelled itself. this wasn't accepted from flipkart. too much disappointment :(
1|1|How can flipkart return item without ever asking me? I have order 2 MI4i though my credit card and it was supposed to be delivered on time, but when i check today morning on my flipkart its showing as return, the question here is how can flipkart cancel my order without ever confirming with me. I have never initiated any request, please shipped the product as soon as possible
0|1|First of all, phone got delivered only after 8 days in flipkart. No return policy for the product, but only exchange. Phone gets unbearably heated while on a call. Even when applied for exchange, one guy calls, speaks rudely and says no problem with the phone and Bye.. Already disappointed about the phone with features like bad swipe (as I use my Whatsapp more), slower touch response time and this heating issue now (btw I haven't even downloaded any apps other than whatsapp, sudoku)...On top of it, an extremely poor service from flipkart and the seller. utterly disappointed..Not able to give 0 rating here..13k got wasted...
0|4|Go for it best piece, all good in this range,,, just need extra space 16gb is not enough....waiting for 32gb version to come back in stock...so Flipkart please bring back 32gb one.
0|1|Useless phone and useless after sales service. Never advice anyone to buy Xiomi. Phone got disconnected frequently while talking and there is no solution with service team to resolve the issue.
0|5|Dear Sir, I Nrusingha Panda placed an order no-OD204181804314122000 for MI 4i and i requesting you to please shipment through DTDC Courier as i get it at the provided address without any delay. I will get back to you and wish your valuable service.
0|5|The phone is amazing without doubt however today I want to talk here about Flipkart. The first unit I received was a faulty one, with many manufacturing defects such as Speaker phone not working, sound fluctuating during call and application's closing on their own intermittently without any valid justification. Initially I thought all my hard earned money was wasted. However when I spoke to Flipkart's Tech team later regarding the problems I was facing they heard patiently and asked me to try to reset the phone to factory settings and then see if the problems were still recurring. When I confirmed to them that I already tried that out as an initial troubleshooting technique, but it didn't fix anything; they readily agreed to take a request for return of the phone. They confirmed from me if I wanted money back or if I wished to receive a fresh piece of the handset in return of the old one. I went for exchange and guess what the exchanged handset had none of the issues that I reported. I value Flipkart for valuing my time and money and getting me a premium customer service experience. Flipkart's way of business is unmatched.
1|1|Please make sure service center for product you are selling must work. It's very hard to trust you if there is no service available for main stream product. It's been 4 month phone is working good, and at a sudden it's dead. There is no service center at surat, Gujarat working nowadays.
0|1|Hi Guys, Don't buy redmi products, within short period of time mobile will get heat and will impact the product mother board and touch screen. For this issue you will not able to claim warranty, to resolve this manufacture defects in Remdi product you have to pay 80% of your mobile cost. Post this service you will not get any grantee. We found that many of them facing such issue and seeking to different mobile model purchase with in short period itself. again my kind request don't buy redmi product whatever the prize, still lots of manufacture issue need to be resolved on this product. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR BUYING THE REDMI PRODUCTS.
0|1|I purchased the same phone.But i still facing Network issue.I tried to gave the phone for service to MI authorised service center.Even they are not able to fix IT.Still iam facing the same issue,Mobile network getting DROP abruptly.So
0|1|I was a big fan of Xiaomi products and purchased many other products from Xiaomi until now. One month back my mobile screen got broke and half of its touch screen stopped working. I contacted the Xiaomi Service center and they told it will charge 6086 rupees to change the screen and it will take 8 working days to get it repaired. I gave mobile last week Saturday i.e 3rd October ,2015 . After one week I tried to contact them through phone to check status but the phone was busy all the time I tried so There was no other way rather than going to the service center directly. I went to service center there a lot frustration was waiting for me so many people with issues and very few people to resolve it. I patiently waited for my turn and finally when I got my turn they told to come after week it is still not repaired. So here are my opinion of the Xiaomi service center. 1. The contact number is just a dummy number and won’t work at all it will be always busy. 2. The infrastructure is very poor and it worse than public toilet. 3. No status updates at frequent intervals. 4. Xiaomi service is too bad.
0|5|don't purchase mi4i,mi service is 0 I have purchased Xiaomi Mi 4i Order No. OD302915157486663800, IMEI No 866376020514086 on dated 22-05-2015 via Flipkart.com and now I have faced problem mobile Front side camera and Hotspot so I have submitted mobile at Ensure Support Service India Ltd, Surat on dated 4th Sept 2015, Work Order No SUR/XM/15/03955 and Service Center return the mobile after one week and faced again the same problem at same time at service center, surat therefore again submitted on dated 4th Sept 2015 and now I have called several times to local service center, Surat and customer service center 1800 103 6286 and the customer service center updated me that we will return the mobile after two months due to not available hardware.

1|1|Please don't buy any xiaomi mobiles. my Mi4i moble touch does not working. And my problem is logged in service center. 40 days is over but not responding about this problem. I am contacting with service center every day but they not proceeded any action of my problem.
1|1|worst mobile.my money waste.hanging,overheating, red line coming unknowingly on.pls dont waste your money.its very bad
0|1|I had bought this mobile as an anniversary gift to my wife but the mobile does not function properly, over heating issues, ring tone goes to mute without reason, slow processing, overall experience was pathetic and annoying. I had requested for a refund/replacement, that was also denied by flipkart saying they are platform providers. Extremely dissatisfied with the attitude and reply. I OWED NOT TO SHOP on flipkart again. These guys do not own up responsibility for the products that they provide platform for, all they want is to have closure of their tickets. I am logging into flipkart and writing this today, as i had a finally sell this off at throw away price within 3 months of usage :(
0|2|When i heard good reviews about MI phones then i thought of buying one. On 1st purchase i had a big problem with Internet Connection, heating and performance problem. After struggling a lot with Flipkart i could return the product. Now with the 2nd one there is problem with the mic and speaker. Now i don't have a replacement option as well.
0|2|Hi I got a phone in 19th June, now screen is showing a problem. a bright light line at the top right corner of the screen. Please Take back or exchange the mobile..
0|2|Not worth spending money on this phone. Phone hangs various times . even Google play store not working properly.
0|1|cell phone main charging problem ho gai hai 69% sey jiada charg nahi ho rahi trip kar jata hai.........................................................
0|1|After the update to the latest software.. the front camera started giving the issue. Images were blur with full of color pigments. Checked internet and found that its kind of common issue i.e. lot of ppl got this issue and returned the mobile. Raised the return request and flipkart promptly contacted.. accepted the return. Picked it up in one day. Hats off to flipkart for the service. BUT... am I satisfied. No way... I paid 13k for device and it has a hardware issue which ppl are hitting regularly. I kind of remember my friend telling that "its a Chinese mobile" :( Think before you buy it
0|1|I have bought the MI 4I phone on 21st May, 2015, it was performing well but from the last night it has stopped getting charged. Even after rebooting and switching on many times the problem has not been solved. I have tested 3 different chargers but the same problem continues so it is not the problem of the charger.The order number was OD302906609626230800 and it is in the warranty period, so plz change the phone and solve the problem.
0|5|ITS AWSOME PURCHASE . WORKING NICELY AND DEAL WITH FLIPKART IS VERY GOOD.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|The phone is good for its price except the fact that it hangs alot at times but the main issue is after sale service. The after sale service will make you regret buying this phone. The staff is not skilled enough on how to handle the customer. The service centre is not able to provide the serviced product back within the deadline they give you. i would suggest you to buy some other phone from a known brand. I wish i could rate this negative not for the product but for the service.
0|1|I bought this phone 3 months ago. - Initially flipkart suggested updates which resolve heating issue of my phone. - But after 20 day of buying I started facing touch problem. The touch completely goes off while using wifi and making 5 min call. Initially flipkart said that they may give replacement but after a long hold after making complain they replied that they are not giving any replacement. - I have already made all the updated and visited service center once. - Finger crossed Hope this issue will be resolved at the service center on second visit otherwise this phone will be completely scrap for me. Feature of this phone: - Look (good) - Rear Camera (also good and come up with many inbuilt modes) - Front Camera ( good for taking Selfie due to its beauty mode but not good for video call) - Android version ( lollipop seems more user friendly and screen icons looks cool in miUi) - Internet use ( Night mode option in browser is very good ) - One hand use mode is new. - Gaming (Phone heats up after 15 to 20 min for heavy games sometime game automatically stops) - Touch (Unlucky for me - not working after 20 days of buying)
1|1|I M USING MI4I SINCE THREE MONTHS, BUT FROM PAST 10 DAYS MY IS GETTING RESTARTING AGAIN N AGAIN AND ALSO THERE IS NO SERVICE CENTER IN MY AREA, AND THERE IS HEATING PROBLM, BATTERY LAST FOR 1 DAY MAX, SATISFIED 10% OUT OF 100%. SENDING PHONE TO A FRIEND FOR A SERVICE CENTER HOPE MY ISSUE GET RESOLVED AFTER GETTING MY ALL OLD DATA DELETED :-( .
0|1|i started using the ph and facing so many problems like ph get hang and screen gets blank. there is a sound problem also.
1|1|Flipkart's return policy is the worst policy compare to other online shopping company. The mobile has some irritating issues like camera is not upto the mark not even equal to 8 mp camera , mobile gets hang frequently and heat problem also I recommend all of you dont waste ur 13000 precious rupees instead of it you must buy lenovo K3 note worth rs. 10000 it will give u satisfaction. Flipkart not even replace the peace so pls pls pls dont buy it.
0|1|The phone is not charging and customer service is bogus. It is my honest opinion to not buy this phone.
0|1|I purched Mi4i phone on 30th May 2015(receiving date).When I Checked/used this phone, I observed few problem on it i.e. it's camera light was not working .hanging problem ,over heating problem..so I talk to Filpkart customer care and they scheduled some technical checks(remotely) and after checking they send me replacement , and I got new phone on 2nd June 2015 .... till this stage it was ok..it can happen with any phone..... But after few days I observed some other problems on this new phone i.e. over heating , most of the applications started crashing , hanging problem..and when i unlock the screen it went black and an error was popup... " Unfortunately, the process com.android. systemui has stopped".... and it started almost every 2nd time of unlocking the phone, then I again called Flipkart customer care...and they asked me that now it's more then one month so we can't replace it so they again schedule for technical check..and during checks that engineer suggested me that you have to reset this phone ..so i did it and after this problem was solved but all other problems were same...and after few days it's camera has stopped working....front and back both.....so I again called Flipkart and they asked me to go it's service centre and provided details of the nearest one(Lajpat Nagar)... I called on that number and got reply that " it's not any Service center address ...wrong address".. Then I searched and found few service center numbers...I called on all numbers but got reply only from one and that was in Sector 18 Noida..so I went there and showed it to technical person...he checked and asked me to leave this phone for minimum 25 days..and said even after 25 days he can't promise to give it back..Because they don't have any parts...during this 1-2 hour's I saw people's are almost fighting and abusing to that owner....b'coz they are not able to repair their phone even after more than one month....and all asked that owner(Dinesh) to mention on their job card that he don't hv any parts so he can't repair ..but he said that he don't hv authority to write this.... So Xiomi please sort out this issue . I am facing problem with this phone from the day I purchased it.... it will be great full if you will refund my money and take this garbage back..
0|1|Bought in the 1st sale and despite being OCTACORE, it always used to hang and all problems had only one solution,i.e, to format the phone. Even after getting the replacement, I was unable to play a simple song well, even the playback hanged every second. Where is the octacore then? Opted for return.
0|1|I dropped the phone from 3 feet and screen got cracked from one corner also capacitive button stopped working other things working fine. Earlier I had nexus 4 phone which I dropped several times but nothing happened but this Mi4i phone is absolute having no durability. I approached to service center which was 200 km away from city they demanded 9K for screen replacement,But demanding 9 k for screen is absolutely ridiculous for 13 K phone which makes 70% of phone cost. I will never buy any Xiaomi phone in future.
1|1|I wouldn't recommend this phone to Indian users at all. Indian users because of considering our climatic conditions. I am sure they have not tested the phone with a small increase in ambient / phone temperature. Tthe phone has some serious heating issues. If its just the heating of phone then may be i would live with. What has made me more annoyed by the phone is the issues that come up with a small increase in temperature. The phone hangs if the temperature increases that if it hangs.....the phone is of no use. ITS MY HUMBLE REQUEST TO EVERYONE NOT TO GO FOR Mi4I
0|1|very poor phone absolutely wastage of money. the company xioami makes worst phones which does not last for more than 3 to 6 months. had bought mi 4 earlier which lasted not more than 1 month took me while to get my refund and then now mi4i lasted not more than 3 months. some charging issue. xioami phones are way below any standards and their phones dont last long. simply crap China product and shit company. stay away from mi phones aas they all r crap and hardly work for 3 to 6 months. money wasted totally.
0|1|Product has started re-booting after 3 months with out any reason. Product has issues while dialing a no. as the dialing screen doesn't appear. There are issues for disconnecting the call and it takes sometime to disconnect as the phone goes to hung state. After disconnection it gives an SIM Error. Have locked a complaint with Flipkart. Awaiting replacement of the cell with the new one.
1|1|I purchase Mi 4i before 2 days and found that front camera has color issue so I placed a request for return it sent me mail that your issue resolved request rejected but the issue was not resolved.I request buyers to be aware Flipkart does not keep its promise at all
0|1|Do not buy this fon or any of the other Xiaomi Fons. I purchased Mi4i 3 months ago from Flipkart. While delivery was made quick and in gud condition, the fon itself looked nice and with very many functions. But within 3 months its screen went blank. Then I came to know about the lack of service centres of Xiaomi. From Vapi Gujarat, I had to travel all the way to Surat to put my fon for repair. The Service Guys have told me that it will take 25 days at least to get it bak. I asked my freind who lives nearby and who had also purchased a Xiaomi Fon abt its performance. Surprisingly I found that he was also to that Service Centre for a Screen Flaw. Now what r d chances, that two people who purchsed same barnd fon develop mistakes in their respective fons within 3-4 months of purchase. At the service centre also I found that other Xiaomi customers were not at all happy with their fons. So i suggest samsung or Motorola or even Micromax fons but dont buy this Chinese cheap fon, which is not so cheap.
0|1|twice the phone was delivered to me but was in defective condition..cant understand how come new mobile was delivered in such condition
0|1|Mi is making lot of money from our pocket. But zero service after sales. recently my Mi3 got little wate. It was switching on. But I am not able to login as the touch function was not working. I thought touch function is only not working and may be rectified. but the service centre asked my Rs. 9k. I bought the new phone for 9K, WHY should i spend 9k for service...that to with in warranty. There service is not good. they have limited centre only one in bangalore and for the entire karnataka only two centre. I asked then at least recove my data. that also they told not possible. when it is switching on , software is ok, calls were comming to my phone, only thing is not able to log in, how come the data is lost??? very very bad service. zero service after sales.
0|3|can you deliver my order faster??I want my order before 24 of this month though scheduled date is 26!!
0|1|I purchased this phone and now I am cursing myself for ever thinking of buying it. My phone developed a crack on the screen. When I went to the service centre, they told me to wait for 30 days for the replacement of screen on my phone and even they will not replace my phone. Worst product ever.
1|4|I got my Mi4i delivered on 1st sept and after 20 days with it I am writing a review. The delivery was on time by Flipkart but I faced hell lot of trouble ordering it and had a worst experience witho there customer service. I was facing problem in ordering it and called CS, I got a reply that there systems are not working. what the hell. Some how I managed to place an order, the delivery was on time. Well the product till date is amazing though I am not using it for hard core gaming just normal use. Its performance is fast..And also it heats up after update//I bought its toughened glass from Gaffar Mkt and a nylon Skin for Rs 100 each.
0|5|PHONE IS VERY AWESOME ITS SMOOTH WORKING NO HANGING PROBLEM I HAVE USED FOR 4 MONTH BUT I HAVE NO MY MI4I PHONE ....................... AWESOME PHONE
0|1|I am very disappointed with battery installed in mobile as its backup is very low after just 4 months of use, and we are unable to replace the same as this mobile is non open-able to change the battery.
0|1|The 'WORST' phone I have ever used. Absolutely no technical support. Unprofessional Public Relation Officer with hardly relevant technical knowhow about the phone. Even dont know how to use use Mi Cloud or restart the handset. Very annoyed with the experience. Think twice before getting this phone. It is cheap but not worth.
0|5|i have request to you that i have send my product to return but i did not get any kind of refund in my account so please its humble request to you that please refund as soon as.
0|4|Only drawback is it does not have a expandable memory Battery back up is good.. Camera is good.. front camera is good for video calls.. Its Light weight unlike other brand 5'inch phones. Just upgrade to 6.7.2.0 after you didn't get any issues I am very happy
0|5|reviewing after one month of handling---overall its nice phone at this price range..scope for more improvement.
0|1|a bakwas mobile ever it doesnt work properly full of malfunction and heating problem plz guys dont buy it its a real dabba mobile too much issue with mobile and flipkart pcustomer care is not helping me with this issue
0|2|Do not buy this device. All specs are good. but heating is the main issue.if you are living in a place where temperature raising more than 27 degrees, then the phone will get hanged. if you use the camera in this temperature you will feel the hanging issue very well. I using this device for the last 5 months. I spend almost 10 hours in my air conditioned office. so that time am not felt any big issues . but in the daytime outside its very bad. even i cannot pick a call because of heat issue. And also the network issue is there. You cannot get uninterrupted network from this device. I am using airtel 3g and my friends also using airtel 3g but they were able to browse simply.I bought the device from flipkart. And am living in Kerala State.
0|2|For replacing Screen, Customer service center takes upto 25 days. which is a very long period. Also the price for new touch screen is 4200 Ra which is costlier than other phones within same range. Customer Service Center no. at their Chandigarh centre is unreachable. Also there is lot of heating problem even without playing games on phones.
0|5|Excellent phone with excellent performance, camera and display clarity. Its worth of money. Its the best mobile in 12999/- range @ this time. Thanks for Flipkart for great service.
1|1|I ordered this mobile from flipkart. Hardware and software are totally buggy. There is extensive heat problem with this mobile., I tried my best to get replacement. But flipkart is too arrogant. Here is the problem. Mobile temperature raises steaply to 44'C and I took screenshot of that and mailed flipkart 4 times. but they rejected it saying its an allowable temperature only. Just imagine how much heat it is and how irrresponsibly flipkart answered. FYI. max temperature to use is 35'C maximum. I even met J Mani(VP, Xiaomi India) in person and told him the problem. He promised me that it will be resolved after a software update. Believe it or not., they given 3 to 5 updates till date... still heat problem is not resolved. If at all it was a software problem., it should have got resolved. But its a hardware problem., but both Xiaomi and flipkart refused to accept it. I can provide screenshot if you want of both temperature and mail trail with flipkart. So, kindly dont but products from Xiaomi and burn your money.
0|1|I bought a Mi 4i from flipkart 2 months back and after using the phone for 2 weeks I came to know that on the go ( OTG) pendrives were not working with my phone. So I went to a service center with the problem but they said they can not resolve it and that I needed to contact the customer service. So I tried calling the customer service number but no one is receiving the call and it has been over a month now but still no one is replying on that number even after my repeated attempts to call them. Even the mails I sent them are being rejected by their server. And the service center is also of no help. I am very much regretting buying this phone. So if anyone is planning to buy this phone beware, though it appears good on paper, the performance is not so good and the after sales service ( if there is any) is worst. And if you have already bought it then pray to god that you don't need to visit the service center. Flipkart should ensure that the companies it ties up with should provide the necessary customer support.
0|1|since starting phone is troubling . it get switch off if phone is idle for few min. initially I thought it is some setting but I tried every setting and it took months but no help . now recently it has started giving camera error . camera is not working . I have tried factory reset also but no luck. very frustrating . will never buy phone online.
1|2|Hi when check with my handset box, I have not found handfree with the same. so pls check with your team and provide me the samr.
0|5|Good phone in terms of everything except additional storage space. Company launched 32gb version just after 2 months instead of launching both version together (16gb & 32gb) . If released on same day…………………………………………….???????????????????????
0|4|camera does not have any autofocus ability - disappointing persistent heating issue even after upgrading OS Display is very good could have been better overall
0|1|this phone had issues from the beginning and after replacement too it has so many bugs...tough i am not able to get refund of this shit phone. i'll have to run again for the late MI services.
0|1|this product is totally money wasting .. don't buy... the mobile have hanging problem heating problem ...sometime it misbehave .....and when i off my phone and after some time i want to this ON then its taking tooo much time to restart .....and sound quality is also bad
1|1|I got this phone after a long wait but it clearly disappointed me with its performance.First of all I loved this phone with its cool design and stunning camera performances,but now I am really regretted with my choice. Plus: 1.Cute and Handsome design. 2. Stunning Camera. Problems: 1.Display, When you make a call,sometimes the display went blank and you will be unable to even disconnect the call.You want to reboot or factory reset to get it normal. 2.Sometimes your icons in phone will be black,you can open or even trace which application is that and some all order will be shuffled automatically. 3.The phone having 3120 mAh battery but you will not get it one full day.. 4.The phone will be heating heavily most of the times. 5.Sometimes the phones sound will be mute automatically.You can see the phone ringing but there will not be any sound.I tried all settings if it happened by mistake,but it ready only after reboot. 6.I am getting a message most of the time when I open the phone,"Do not cover the orange area of the screen...like something" I tried to take screenshot of the same but failed because its in locked state.Still I don't know whats that. 7.Hanging problem or Lagging issues. The camera is one of the best thing in this phone but sometimes you will not be able to take photos because of its hanging problem. 8.Force close issues,this is a common thing in this phone. 9.Service is one of the worst part from MI (Especially Kerala),I contacted them for support and it was a very worst experience.They don't know even how to speak with customers.If you are not getting proper support for frequently complained devices like this,what is the use of it?. 10.If you register any return request,flipkart will call you once in a day,that time if you are in another call or even a drive or if unable to attend that call,they only call another day, and you cant call them back.If it happens twice they will reject your request without any other call. 11.I used 2 phones (MI4I) and still using for last two months,I can say from the bottom of my heart,MI4I is purely a disappointment.You will definitely regret if you go for it.
0|1|One fine day my mobile stopped working all of a sudden. When I took the mobile for repairs at MI service center, representative told me that my mobile was submerged in water and hence I need to pay 80% of cost for repairs. On asking them to prove this, they couldn't show me anything. It was very very disappointing for me to hear something like this as I knew such thing has never happened. These people were least bothered and show no care attitude. I am very frustrated with the kind of service
0|3|overall good. user friendly....but getting heat quickly......no memory card slot.....no ear phone....
0|2|no head phones .. thats wrong if we are buying mobile of Rs 2000/- in that also we are getting head phone.. this is not done.. not satisfied
0|4|gor the prompt delivery by Flipkart and product is also good. using from last 5-6 months, overall good performance.
1|1|poor audio quality ringtone sound very poor dont buy it please dont buy it memory low only 11 gb space in this mobile
0|2|Parts are not available in the service centers, takes 20-30 days for the parts to arrive the service center
0|3|i bought this mobile last month,i havent received my headset in the box....also i had problem with battery
0|5|Worth for the money... especially its battery life and camera clarity... Unbeatable.... Simply Awesome..
1|2|I bought this product few Months ago. I liked it for the fancy features. However, I recently tried configuring corporate exchange email account on this phone however, it did not get through. I have learnt from various forums that Mi4i does not support microsoft exchange, outlook. I need to downgrade the OS to some level for this to work. I can't understand why in the world Xiaomi doesn't support most popular enterprise application support on its phones. Now I am looking to get ridoff this phone and replace it with more standardized phones.
1|1|Its 3 months over to purchase One replacement till heating issue is there and now Charging is not getting done Customer support asking for 5 days to be get replaced the charging point Don't know in a year how many times I have to face issues
0|1|good: good clarity camera in front and back good looking Bad If u use 20min it will heat like any thing. Bad customer support from flipkart.( they are accepting this problem)
0|1|Its very Bad to face this kind of situation from FK. But after opening the box I realised that there r no ear phones in the box. And More over the box is well packed and and I checked the seal also. everything was perfect but earphone is missing.
1|1|I got my phone like may 14th and issues was with over heating at first, this phone is not much gud user friendly. Then comes the main part there are only a few service centers across India and most of them wont take phone. and only way to deliver the phone to them is directly. I tried to contact them for 1 week and i tried a second service center i had to travel 300kms to get a service. and my phone is dead and unusable till now don't know whether they gonna fix it or not. NO LOCAL SERVICE CENTERS TAKE MI 4I FOR SERVICING
0|1|disadvantage: flipkart giving used pieces and no warranty claimable products...!! heat issues advantage: camera quality user-interface slim speed..etc pls don't buy on flipkart...better use Mi store to buy phone with different colors!!
0|1|I HAVE BOUGHT MI4I FROM FLIPKART. BUT WHEN I HAVE DECIDED TO RETURN MOBILE DUE SOME PRODUCT ISSUES, FLIPKART HAS SIMPLY REJECTED BY GIVING REASON THAT "NEED UPDATE" IN YOUR MOBILE. I HAVE TOLD THEM THAT I HAVE ALREADY MADE UPDATES, STILL THEY TOLD ME TO TALK ON CUSTOMER CARE WHICH IS NEVER ACTIVE...... I RECOMMENDS NOT TO BUY FROM FLIPKART.
1|1|Item have been received before time but I got faulty piece as mobile is swallow on the back. looks like faulty battery is used. Please suggest if there is return or exchange policy.
0|1|I purchased MI4i on 3rd May, phone was decent enough with very good UI and performance, though feels cheap in hand. Buttons were very fragile and it feels they can come out any time. After 3 months one day I was not able to insert charger on my phone. I went to Bangalore, Marathalli service center and the guy there said that it is physical damage as you must have inserted charger pin the opposite way. I was shocked as it happens with every phone that you insert charger pin the wrong way, but he was not willing to hear. I agreed to pay 600/- to replace charging port. The worst part was it took 2 weeks for the service people to return my phone. I used to like Mi products but now I will never buy one.
1|4|You all might heard of it's pros' but there are certain cons too... i m going to compare it with my last cell moto G1.. Speaker quality is not as good as moto g... gets a little heated up whenever you charge or play games... Takes a little too long to charge.. Personally I hate the way the sim slot has been made... Even with all these cons' as per me.. its a great phone with super fast multi tasking...
0|1|15 days already gone my pick up will not done . daily i called flipkart he kept saying tmw will b done but still no response. do buy in flipkart he s a big cheater fraudddddddddddddddddd
0|1|I bought the phone seeing the good reviews of same phone of Mi 4i .. But i got the phone with defective features in it Such as using the 2 or 3 apps on opening 4 app its getting strucks and downloading of single app taking atleast minimum 30 mins to download throught wi fi and even the battery gets heating while keeping charging ... I called two to 3 times to flipkart people there is no proper response nor giving resolution in taking back the phone nor about refund..they even informed that techical people will be calling but till now there is no response from them..once they called and it was disconnected and again they informed that they will call back tomorrow throught message.. I never seen this kind of bad service and defective phone i may receive from flipkart.. Mind set had changed not to use Redmi any brand again please take back these defective phone and refund my money ... atleast i can buy another brand phone such as Nexus or Samsung J5 or J7 Note: Note even inserted my sim and just one day(2/9/2015) before bought the phone
1|1|i purchased mi4i which they delivered me on 19 may 2015 ,just after 15 days its touchpad stops working automatically,so i sent it to service center,now the story start from here. flipkart,xiaomi call center & nagpur service center all this peoples pushed me to another. pls dont buy any xiaomi product as they sold there product neither xiaomi nor flipkart will take care of customers.as i bought more than 10 different phones also purchased there flipkart first membership,they dont care . pls pls pay little more and buy to samsung or any brand who have there service center in ur city.but pls dont go with this Chines.

1|5|+ Battery + Camera(front n rear) + UI + SCREEN :} + NO LAGS - No headphones - lack of accessories in market
0|1|I got the phone its working fine for 3 months and after that i facing lot of issue 1, The heating problem 2.network issue And after that when i checked with flip-kart they told me that u have to visit to service center ' Because where i am staying Right now their is no service center They told me directly that we are not able to help you The response which i get is pathetic They also don't know how to G read the cm
1|1|Product HAS heating issues even if regular use (normal apps: Music, camera, gmail). The worse is when I returned it to Flipkart, they DID NOT refund me the full amount under exchange policy. Flipkart has NOT TAKEN ANY initiative to make sure my full amount is refunded/reflected in my account. They have both my money and my device now. Their Exchange policy is a gamble. Likelihood To Recommend you guys is: 0 on 10 (under exchange). Be Happy Flipkart! (Thieves)
0|1|very bad experience in this product when i am charging this phone it's get heated and continues 20 mintus talking in that time also getting heated i complaint against this phone in flipkart they also agree this phone have these issues. money lose ,waste , useless phone. and i get bad experince in flipakart customer care also
0|1|I Purchased this product 4 months back. However, the touch screen is not working and there are issues of phone hanging and poor battery backup. Tried to call up the call center no. and guess what it is busy 24/7. Sent at least 4-5 emails. There is no reply even after 7 days. Now I am going back to the trusted Samsung. ..
0|2|its been nly 2 days ive started using this phone... n it is already heating up... first of alll the delivery got delayed by 3 days n even after the delay the phone which ive got is heating up... its very disoppointing....
0|1|i had received this product on 6th august 2015 and it was shipped by WS Retail and just after 15 days of usage speaker gave up and a very irritating sound was coming so i raised a complaint with flipkart stating that i want a replacement for my product given the fact that the seller accepts 30 days return policy yet flipkart was so arrogant to just say that your order cannot be replaced , such audacity , i had ordered lot from flipkart but now i guess i have to change my online seller !!!!
0|1|Hi Everyone, The hype created for the phone was very much genuine till i got the handset for my husband last month on 6th Aug(25 days old) , this one is faulty piece and i have had numerous conversation with there executives for the replacement of the handset but i was only given promises that someone will call me to resolve the issue. The phone sensor doesn't work the phone hang imperatively and i have lost all my patience when i received a message stating it will not be replaced this is when i got no call from there said Technical department, Pathetic services...I am sorry team you guys suck and so is your services. I will never recommend your site to anyone, never.
0|1|THIS ITEM GOT LOT OF PROBLEM IN CHARGING AND WHILE SWITCH OFF ONLY BUFFERING AND MANY TIMES ITS HANG. WANT TO RETURN BACK THE ITEM.
0|1|MI 4i totally wastage of money. Lots of issue. Touch is not working. Too heat up even in ideal mode. Sound quality so bad No refund policy. Very poor camera quality. Very poor service a HCL touch(Service Centre) 3-4 Hours waiting period in working days. 6-7 Hours on Saturday. I advice you all be away from third class Chinese stuff like MI. Very fraud company as well as Flipkart. They have denied for refund and replacement also.
0|3|I am purchasing item from flip kart very long time. today I had very surprising experience from flip kart delivery person , after deliver the mi4i the delivery person asking Rs.10 as tips .whether you are paying salary for them or not, it makes me uneasy and given the money to him, and my friends also feel bad on your delivery person ,even he didn't wear uniform too. Pl ensure it should not happened in future to any one of your customer Pl take a serious look on to this issue. Regards, Jeya
0|1|I am using the phone for 3 days and I facing the same problems which I faced for my earlier device. Battery gets drained really fast ( it's like 1% drain in one minute) and the phone hangs often. Flipkart doesn't seem eager to give a replacement
0|1|First time i have facing issue of photo clearity,sound clearity & net issue. I am raise the complaint to Flipkart-after checked with flipkart technical team,i got the replacement. But i am facing issue in replacement mobile also-Blurry photo coming, not supporting the Internet.
0|3|The phone is working good but within a month of purchase I am facing problem with the external speaker. Battery backup is good. If you are switching from a samsung device it would take time to adjust to Mi4. Please help me out in replacing this piece.
1|1|Poor after sales service, they take 25 days to rectify any fault. even if your charger is faulty they will take around 25 days with all regular reminders etc.
0|1|It's been just two months that I bought this phone and the touch has stopped working. The Xiaomi do not intend to materialize the warranty they give with this phone because the xiaomi customer care number 18001036286 is always busy so you cannot contact them. Also their Service centers exist only on papers and net, but in reality it does not. I recently visited the Jaipur center and I came to know it was closed permanently. So basically you have no option to get your phone repaired/replaced. You have to spend extra bucks on your phone in case any problem arises, because the concept of warranty does not really exist.
0|1|Is it waterproof,scratch proof and fireproof as shown by the company in youtube?? Is the phone overheating even after MIUI 6 update??? Is it really worth it? I need answers for these questions before i buy it......
0|1|At first I was very delighted when I received this phone, but that changed after few days of usage. There are following issues: 1. Internet is damn slow and by 'slow' I mean that I almost couldn't browse any webpage. 2. Signal reception is very poor. Plus, it continuously keeps connecting and disconnecting. 3. SIM cards get removed at random and very frequently. The SIM tray must be faulty. 4. Heating issues, but that was expected already. Flipkart customer care solved the "no internet problem" initially, which worked fine for 2-3 days after which it again stopped working (I again tried to fix it the same way but it didn't work) and more issues with the phone cropped up. Maybe I received a faulty product but this is what I experienced. Currently this phone is lying unused with me as I don't know what to do with this brick. I completely wasted my Rs 13,000/- on this cheap thing. I will never buy any handsets from cheap brands like this from now on. Will go for Samsung or Motorola only.
1|2|phone hangs too much. touch also hangs.................. poor quality phone..........................................................................................................................
1|1|While charging the board was burned service center people are saying it was due to water damage when i was there in service center i saw 4 customers saying all they were liquid damage the charges should be born by customer. My phone was opened by the service center person in front of me but there is no water in the phone still they were saying it's liquid damage only. Flipkart is not taking any action after selling the product.
0|1|One month of use and the screen cracked on its own in my pocket, and the touch even is not working. Is this what corning glass meant to be. Highly dissatisfied with Mi and even flipkart for selling such cheap quality products.
1|1|Friends dont buy any thing from Flipkart, because they are only manipulated you. I had Mi4i and after the usage of 10 Dyas its not working properly (Hanged, Network Problem, What's App not Working, Hang in Camera Mode), i was called in Flipkart Customer Care and request them to replace it and they said that first you go to the service center and then we will decided (Simply they are trying to make me chootiya) So friends please dont buy any electronic items on Flipkart otherwise you are also made a fool like me.
0|1|Battery back up is pathetic. Pathetic is not just enough to describe. Flipkart customer service also sucks.
1|5|Flipkart service has always been excellent by delivery of product before scheduled time with safety. As regards, the MI4I phone delivered to me, I found the phone is not detecting sim cards despite trial of 2-3 sims which otherwise work on other phones. Secondly, the phone takes atleast half an hour to restart/reboot/power off. In a nutshell, I am unable to use the phone and so returning the product.
0|5|Amazing No heating front came awesome back came night time avg over all excellent tq flipkart Superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
0|1|I bought this phone through Flipkart on July 15th 2015 and paid extra INR 99 for one day delivery but the phone was delivered late by one day so the experience started with dissatisfaction. Then after using phone for 2-3 days, I found that the speaker volume is very low and phone gets hang in between, it gets very hot even when not getting used. I lodged a complaint having return id 24534034 but no one approached me. They simply closed the request by saying I was not reachable but neither I received any call nor received any email asking the issue. Their customer care is also very very pathetic. They don't have people to handle the customers. I tried calling them so many times but every time it puts you on hold for minimum 15-20 minutes and then its disconnected. I also disconnected it few times after waiting for 15-20 minutes due to the problem in hearing the hold music and the anger which as a customer I was having. I WILL SUGGEST NOT TO BUY ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART and this phone is also very bad, a complete waste of money.
0|1|It hangs, drops call, cant hear getting worse and worse after 1 month of use. Better avoid and go for some other modal
0|1|I have brought MI4I phone & the the day first I am not able to talk with anyone on call. Only 5% call I can take properly in whole day. During making the call all network goes blank & during receiving the call, it is disconnecting after one ring. Customer care team is not ready to understand the problem that what problem going on due to this. They are providing time slot when technical team talk with me but not ready to listen that provided time slot is not suitable to me.
0|1|when you use net- surfing than device will be very hot and some time device will hangout this problem are regularly i complain flipkrat site but flipkart says it is software problem and says this problem is mobile company problem.
0|4|Mi4i: Pro:Awesome bettery life Best you can get in the price offered. Very powerful touch,nice features well maintained Os ,gives a gud go when you install about 70+ apps,hangs sometimes when there's so many apps are open.no I dont worry when my phone shows me 10% battery remaining and I am in bus bcoz I know by the time I will reach it will be around 7% and by the time I will book my cab using net and sit in the cab it will be 4% and yeah I will inform my relatives that i reached and then I will put it into charge. Some UI changes are that good that it gives you the feeling of real smart phone. Cons: Get hot sometime but its bearable.Screen gets less responsive when you drop a call and you are full of sweat :P Flipkart: Yes some of your executives are smart enough and they know how to handle customers but please fire those who dont even know how to talk with customers. When I want to replace a product I need to install some apk then one person will call me and will waste almost half an hour of mine by conducting some random checks without understanding real problem and then will say we are canceling your replacement. I ssly dont understand who hired these people who are less techie then the support staff working at Flipkart. Now I have literelly moved on to amazon because the dont change their standards by every 2 months and update it in a tiny links provides so 5 for product and 2 for that executive who helped me from flipkart otherwise wud have given zero to it.
0|5|micro sd support with dual sim? yes or no want to know.if i put two sims in the slot is it works sd micro memory?
1|1|The phone Mi4i is just amazing with brilliant features and superb camera quality. But my experience with this phone has turned daunting due to the poor phone quality delivered by WS Retail. I received my brand new phone in August, soon after 2 weeks the phone started showing some software issues. Though the phone was replaced by WS Retail, but the next phone which i received is even in more deteriorating condition. The screen goes blank when you call or get calls, as you turn helpless that you can't cut the call of do anything else on screen. Apart from this, the signal catching quality of this handset is too poor.
0|5|Excellent product. Fast shipping. Packing also good. Easy transaction. If possible send screen guard along with mobile phone.
0|3|This is a good phone every one must buy but aware of the charger. I found charger not working and flipkart toof nearly 25 days to resolve they creditted 600 in my flipkart wallet
1|5|i am here to write about flipkart and ekart fast processing and dispatching items in standard delivery....hats off ,you the baap of all online shopping. actually i wanted this product in a day delivery so planned to book this last morning at 9:32 that august 21 but in a day delivery was not applying so chosen standard delivery but i was little upset ,there comes the roll of flipkart and ekart logistics ,in a standard delivery option it shows expected at 25 aug,but this morning that is aug 22 i got the product delivered before 09:30 am......thankz flipkart and ekart logistics
0|5|i love d phone. but yes it does get heated after playing fr long otherwise its value fr money .........................................................................................................................
0|1|After getting this phone in two days my phone got felt down and display got broken. I went to service center to change my display. They said It need 8 days to get the spar i was waiting for more than 13days still they are asking more time. I am totally fed up with the delay. Also i was getting so much heat
0|1|I have recently purchased Mi4i going through its online reviews but unfortunately, I am really shocked to see that there is a mistake of the company. The calls which are missed are shown as "rejected”, which means if someone calls you and disconnects the call, it shows under rejected calls in your mobile, instead they are to be shown in RED color so that it is easily understood. I have already contacted MI regarding this issue but I don’t know whether the company respects its customers feedback or not ? Lets see whether Flipkart values its customers reviews or not ? How ridiculous is this !!! This is not a good practice, please ask MI to improve your software and rectify this error. Thank you.
1|1|I purchased this phone last month and excellently the display was broken.I am regularly calling to service center delhi there is no response of my call product is good in performance heating issues are there but very bad Service. Now what should i do of this phone.If anyone Knows what should i do. Please guide me there is no service centre at dehradun.
0|1|Worse product with worse service provided by Flipkart....Got defective product, device was heating like heater while talking...You can't even talk. called Flipkart for the replacement initially they said its normal, after doing multiple follow-up and discusstion with them they replaced the product with new one. Unfortunately the replacement device was again having same problem. Again called flipkart customer care and this they said that its normal and they can't replace or refund the money...again after doing multiple follow-up and discussions they finally refunded the money and took back the Mi4i...So overall experience was worse with the product and flipkart service.
1|2|Flipkart gave me a faulty piece and didn't change it either as part of the 30 day replacement. The phone went duhhhh on the 31st day but Flipkart didn't entertain my request. This was my 4th buy of MI4i since launch. Alas Flipkart didn't give me any concession though. Otherwise this phone is amazingly good but I am sure this will see a price drop now like all other MI models, considering there are two phones in the market with exact same features and lesser price. Phone amazing Flipkart I am not happy with your policy.
0|5|Don't think twice before buying, you may wanna go for 32gb version, otherwise its perfect. I was having few scruples before buying but there were none left after using it like a week. It's a bargain.
1|1|I BOUGHT MI4I FROM MI-STORE, IT WAS DELIVERED ON 28/07/2015, SINCE THEN I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SINCE THE PHONE IS NOT WORKING, NO RESPONSE FROM THE COMAPNY TO MY E-MAIL, NO BODY PICKS UP THE PHONE, SERVICE CETRE GUYS DONOT LISTEN TO ME , I HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO THROW THSI PHONE AWAY, I HAVE NOT EVEN MADE A SINGLE CALL FROM THE PHONE ON WHICH I SPENT 13000/- RUPEES, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO THROW YOUR MONEY GIVE IT TO SOME CHARITABLE ORGANISTION RATHER THEN SPENDING ON THIS USELESS CHINESE DEVICE, MY SUGGESTION IS PLEASE PLEASE DONOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OTHER WISE YOU WILL REPENT YOUR DECISION AS I AM REPENTING
0|1|I bought this phone around mid of july.It was working fine for 10 days.And suddenly phone stopped working and a white logo of mi.com appeared on the screen.Then I went to service center to checkout what's the problem.They told me that it's a software crash issue and suggested me to replace the phone from flipkart.So I replaced it with a new phone. After getting a replaced product,same issue happened within 15 days with a slight change that nothing was appearing on the screen(no display).Feeling angry I decided to return the product and got a full refund.But wasted my 400 bucks on scratch guard and cover.So,guyz think twice before buying this phone.
1|5|Very prompt Customer service ... AB HOGI HAR WISH POORI..... JUSTIFIES .... People's hard earned money is taken care ... thanks .
1|1|I bought this phone on flipkart portal. After one month my touchscreen stopped working. So I went to service center they told me it will take 10 day. I gave it to them to replace the screen at the own cost. Firstly they told the screen will take Rs 10000, so I told them the cost of phone is 13000 how can they charge 10000. Then after 5 days they told cost will be 4000 I agreed said it will be available in 10 days. After 2 month still I dont have the phone. Now I got a call that they dont have parts. will take another 20 day. Will recommend not to buy the phone.
0|1|Mobile getting heated up. 2months over. We are complaining and filpkart customer care are giving us the service center no. No body is responding. Each time we call customer care , different responses. Filpkart are not taking the responsibility or owner ship for sold goods.
0|2|only 3 day front cam work clearly after that cam start to grain i had tested all apps but no use very worst response of returning
0|5|wonderful front camera .... marvaleous and exteraordinary.................................................................................................... .................................
1|4|Hi. I was very excited on the receipt of the phone. All things were going good, the delivery the packaging. After inserting my SIM, I switched ON the device, there comes a nice white color logo of 'mi'......and then the DEVIL arrives....after just 45 seconds the display started shivering and the power of the display turns 5 times ( ha ha) means every item on screen turned blurred and now I could see the 5 'mi' logos instead of one and all were shivering. Ok, I requested a replacement immediately. Till then single star. Prerak
0|1|If you are not been able to deliver the product to door step, then why take order in COD. Plus, your tie up with blue dart is also cheap. As I booked this phone on 2nd August 2015 and at last it was canceled by yourself on 19th August 2015. How could your customer can wait for the order for so long. Even after having conversation with customer care service non of you took interest in this matter. You guys are making the people fool. Really disappointing from you.
0|1|MI4I..the worst buy ever..after merely 40 days of usage it has started showing its real colors.The touch screen is not functioning properly..flipkart has this 30 days return policy..now u have to go to service center( a big task is to search for this service centres) and pay for the service charges.Your excitement of being the owner of a new phone will turn into nightmare in few days..Rs.12999 for this product a complete waste..in short you feel the pinch after all its your hard earned money..isnt it :(
0|1|After approval of refund not provinding the refund in my wallet.phone is in dead condition on arrival still they are providing only troubleshooting step & wasting my time.
0|1|I bought this mobile 2 months back. Now I have an issue that it is not able to connect to network. I went to mi service center and today I got a call that the problem is fixed. They said the mother board got replaced. Now as I have warranty, they will replace it for free. What if this problem comes after one year. I have to spend almost 4000 to 5000 Rs.
0|1|HOME BUTTON NOT WORKING FLIPKART SHOULD DO A QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SENDING DEFECTIVE HANDSETS PHONE HANGS FREQUENTLY
1|1|Delicate touch screen. When broke they charged Rs 3500 . Touch does not works for a small scratch and I had to pay 3500. And it is only avaialble in Mi4i service centre only for which I have to wait for 10 days and burn petrol and time to go to service centre. My previous Samsung screen was replaced in local shop for just Rs1000 within an hour. though it had few crack still the touch works. I recommend to go for Moto-g for lesser price with same configuration especially with Gorrilla glass.
1|1|Phone is really amazing BUT.....! After I got the first Mi4i i got that replaced in 10 days because of touch screen issue. Flipkart sent a new phone in 2 days. I was happy for that moment. Again after a month ... I see a new issue with touch screen and touch button. It randomly clicks and open apps. I went to mi Service they downgraded the OS as there are few issue with new update. Now again the same issue and they need atleast 15days to get phone repaired. Xiaomi u lost a customer!!!
1|1|i have complained 3 times but didnt resolved my problem yet. so please help me to resolve the problem. i m facing problem with my front camera,mobile hanging and heating.
1|1|Hi, My name is kshitiz saxena. I have ordered plenty of things from flipkart and never regretted. But I ordered this phone Xiaomi Mi4i (grey) 16gb and I received it in a week. The phone is a defective piece. It is not getting started. I thought that there is no battery in the phone but after charging the phone whole night, it is still not working. Finally, I called flipkart and returning the product but destroyed the box. let's see what happens?
0|1|At First when i recieved the handset after few days the volume went down almost to negliglible every time i played music. this happened repeateadly and had to switch off the handset again and again. since 30 dyas had not completed asked for return but flipkart has a policy of check the phone with some stupid app which played music for 3 secs and certified not fit for return where as problem occured only after playing music for a prolonged period of an hour or more. this request was rejected multiple times. Then after 30 days i have a tint of yellow spot (BIG) on the right corner on the display and cant return it since 30 days have passed. Defective models are supplied by flipkart.
0|1|Using 2 days of experience Phone do not get any incoming call if you are on 4G network. Phone couldn't charge sometime either you restart you phone. Flipkart not returning, they suggested to visit service centre. So buyer beware to buy this phone. you are just throwing your phone in Garbage.
0|2|I purchased this phone from Flipkart It's a very good phone, If you don't have a very high budget you should buy this phone, but don't purchase this product from Flipkart since Flipkart sells defective products You can buy it from the Xiaomi website I recieved the phone with a dead pixel, when i contacted the customer care they said don't worry our technical team will call you but it's of no use they will only keep sending messages that they were unable to contact you, I have given 2 alternate numbers from 2 different service providers but they are still unable to contact me, i even sent them the picture of the dead pixel but still no use all they tell me is that they will contact me My advice, this is a very nice phone buy it directly from the company website, you will get a better quality phone from there
0|1|After 2 months, I can safely say this is the worst phone I have ever used. And Flipkart's service is pathetic. The phone is extremely slow, doesn't connect to the mobile network, 3G has become more of a myth than reality, Heats up so bad its difficult to hold, Fails to run the least graphically intensive games - And the list goes on and on.. OMG!! My 2 1/2 year old Nexus 4 runs circles around this phone. This was a disaster. And Flipkart doesn't offer a replacement for these reasons. Absolutely Awful experience.
1|4|I have purchased Mi4i on 6th June 2015, from flipkart. But on 3rd of August I found that the Screen of this phone was broken while it was kept it in my pant pocket. Flipkart only give one month return warranty. Now it was over. It contacted Mi service centres in Delhi, they informed me that the screen of this phone is not available nationally. When I visited one of the service station at S-114, Virsavarkar Block Sharkarpur, Vikas Marg, Delhi 110092. This is a malti Brand Service Centre of many Mobile company. They informed me that Screen of Mi 4i is not available with them due to national shortage of the screen. Now, I helpless nor flipkart is helping in replacement of the mobile or nor Mi company is helping in replacing the screen of this phone. I have very bad experience with flipkart and Mi company. I am now with a phone after spending Rs.12999/- on this phone. I recommend never purchase Mi phone because if there is some fault in it your whole money will be waste.
1|2|In August I had predicted in my review that the phone was overpriced at 12999/-. Now the price of this phone has dropped to its actual market value. You can get this phone at a price as low as 8500/-. At this price it's a pretty good choice. My old review: THis phone is overpriced. YU Yureka plus with identical spec. (except screen size) and now available at 8999/-. Lenovo K3 Note with similar spec available at 9999/-. Xiaomi's own newly launched Phone Redmi Note-2 with far better processor available below 10K in Chinese market. So price of this phone should be dropped down to 9K-10K and I am sure that this mobile phone will get a price cut in near future, otherwise it can't survive.
1|1|My piece heats up from the very first day ! whatever i do it heats up . Especially temperature is unbearable when i do browsing or any of the apps access internet . what is this ? Do i responsible for heating ? Customer supports says it was ok till 45 degree but dude it hangs also beyond 40 . Should i stop data usage ? then whats the use of all its features like octa-core etc. ? support says that we can do only return but no refund . what if another piece also do the same issues ? so am i fooled by W.S Retail seller . why not refund even brand has to do for customer satisfaction, they can check for parts genuineness also . But please do Refund Under Buyer Protection Policy . Today it crossed the limit going above 45 degree hanging up the phone also . totally disappointed on purchasing this phone . Please refund !
0|1|NEVER TRUST IN SERVICE BY FLIPKART SELLER HARASS THE CUSTOMER. PHONE BATTERY IS NOT LONGER AND NOT COMPLETE CHARGED , SELLER DISAPPROVED MY RETURN REQUEST.
1|1|flipkart has provided horrible/no support. taken 4 attempts to agree them for replacements. every time different executive or senior excutives come on phone. i had to explain the problem again and again. no one takes the responsibility. some excerpts from my mails. " Kindly understand the importance of others time. I cant waste my whole time over this non sense. Already regretting buying from flipkart .total waste of money. The reason for cancellation is not valid and even stupid. kindly check your call logs. I was contacted minutes before the cancellation(over all 4 times was contacted since the return request made). You can see the level of bluryness and flickering in the images. I will escalate this matter, in case of any non assistance. I am frustrated with the after sales service. The issue has become horrible . whole screen is flickering and display is distorted.the issue was dere from the start as I already reported.(PFA) " even no transparency in delivery god knows when the phone will be replaced. btw i have called them 4 times, no use.
0|1|Ordered MI4i online from flipkart. They couldn't deliver it in even 18 days, to Parel.. IN heart of Mumbai. What to say ? No contact or email communication.. They misplaced my Airtel SIM with the previous order of the same phone & never i heard a word about it.. Really feeling bad.. Didn't want to order from another website. BUt what to do ??? 1 STAR = PATHETIC SERVICE BY FLIPKART
0|2|product is good but delivery was very bad i asked them again and again where my product was as i had to take my flight due to them i had to miss my flight
0|1|I found a defective piece of mi4i it is heating much from first day while using 10-15 minutes. on behalf of this product i want to exchange by other products not a same one but flipkart not allowed me.
0|4|this product is very good in specification like display, ram, internal storage. but i had some issues with the display for twice. first time i got the replacement. and the second time i got refund... thank you flipkart. actually i am a mi fan... and i miss that
0|3|The product is good but, after 15 days the colors of my display faded and became worse. got it replaced, that to for replacement flipkart took more days which was very annoying.
0|1|My piece of mi4i is dead (mother board crashed with in 3 months) But last couple of week we are facing some problem on regular interveral. I.e. Like restart, hanging. Heating. Last 7 days before , my handset is switch off. I try to on but it’s not working . I disused with above matter in service center , they answer me very Roudly , I ask a question after replacing mother board can I resolve my Problem. He not provide me proper answer. They told me if u facing a problem again you have to take a coupon. And visit again .It is answer my question. I am a customer can I accepted that answer. I am facing a very bad experience with Malad xiaomi service center executive. Even Filpkart person also saying same answer. what can i do ?????????????????????????????????????? I had placed for replacement hoping this was one defective product. However, the callback executive's responses made me feel that I should go for a refund. Still I have not received any confirmation.
0|5|i am writing this review after 2 months of use.Many people are complaining about heating problem but i didnt face any may be because i am an average user though phone gets warm due to lot of apps i have installed on my device (not games) but i think its normal.lets see the pros and cons 1.Both cameras are superb 2.No lagging till date 3.Battery performance is good 4.Sound quality is AWESOME in earphones even batter than my sony ipod so if you are a music lover who prefer songs to listen in earphones then go for it blindly. Speaker output is not too loud but good 5. Display is fabulous 6. regular update from Xiaomi Cons 1. If u will use too many apps it will get warm during use and charging but please dont confused it with heating Acc to me storage is not a limitation, 16gb is more than enough for pics, songs and videos but if u are still not satisfied than you can use otg support to connect pendrives to your device and can upload pics to cloud to free up the space. At the ending note i would like to say that its a beast if you r a normal user then go for it and if u r a hardcore gamer than dont buy this phone
0|5|good mobile...nice cam...nice ram...looking good.........................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|I placed an order to return Mi 4i Phone due to certain problems like Battery Drains Quickly, and Hits up to 48-50 Degrees and Poor Camera Clearity.But the process to return is too hectic that I spend my 4 days to convince the flipkart customer care, that i have received a faulty product. Flipkart Technical Team member was behaving so rudely like Its our fault if we buy Mi company's phone. Even they addressed Mi as Cheap and Chinese Phone Maker Company. After talking more than 60 minutes he generated a request for replacement but not the return. Flipkart First Membership is useless though it says that Priority Customer Service is given to Flipkart First Members. I think it is Flipkart Last Membership which is being given. I am plannning to contact CNBC Pehredaar to help me return this product and get full refund of the amount. Totally Fed up with Flipkart Easy Return !!
0|1|I bought this phone for my friend with huge expectation. This was the phone which we all were waiting for and the phone which i finally got had heavy heating issue. The phone would simply start heating even when we are not doing some task.Tried latest software update of one GB and it didnt help,.Must be some hardware issue. and to my bad luck Flipkart reject refund/return. So i thought this happens to all companies. Every company produces one or two faulty phones in production batch. A friend of mine also ordered this phone. his phone had a dead pixel right out of the box. He got the phone replaced and his phone now has no issues. Another friend of mine dropped his two day old Mi 4i and the screen cracked. 6K to repair it. He is not having any issues with his phone now also. But i seariously doubt Xiaomi quality cuz of these incidents.
0|1|These Chinese companies are the worst. Bought this phone 2 months ago after all the hype and drama through a flash sale. Kept it unopened to gift it to my dad. When my dad started using it from the first day onward an error "'Unfortunately com.apps.google.process stopped'. It just keeps coming. Nothing can be done. You just keep clicking OK OK 1000 times and it just doesnt stop. Cant return it to flipkart as it is over a month. I hope flipkart takes notice and connects me to some MI person. my 12000 has been wasted.
0|1|SR YOGESH KUMAR YADAV AS PER OFFER THER IS NO AIRTEL 4G SIM CARD WITH MY PHONE.DUE TO THIS I AM VERY DISATISFIES WITH FLIP CART SERVICE.SO IWANT TO RETURN YOUR ALL PRODUCT.ANOTHER I ORDER FOR WHITE COLOUR BUT ITS NOT.

If anybody have the same issue then plzzz contact me... I'm going to take legal actions for that after talking to customers care of FLIPCART and XIAOMI

1|1|phone is gating heat and hanging pro and ear spekar pro and not working play store through mobile data please exchang my mobile because my phone having hugu problem
1|1|I have purchased many Xiomi models but this is my first negative feedback.This set is having some hearing problem and voice is not audible properly. Also found noise during a call . But if I put the sim in other handset then voice become clear . Please advise how to exchange this set as I am not interested to repair this new set. Regards, Pulak
0|2|I received the product in good time, without doubt. However, I need an explanation. if I am buying a new mobile phone, that comes in a sealed package, whose box reads that inside there are certain components pertaining to the phone; HOW DO I NOT RECEIVE THE HEADPHONES???? It obviously indicates that it wasn't a sealed pack. Arrange to deliver the headphones, at the earliest. Or I may have to bring the matter to greater light.
0|5|the best phone.just go for it.............................................................................
0|1|Though product is high end low price. Customer service for any fault is very poor. 1. Customer service lines are always busy. 2. No response in online chat option 3. Service center works only from 10 AM to 6 PM (Monday to Saturday). I guess most of your customers are workin men/women who has work to do and cant reach service center before 6 PM or after 10 AM. 4. No replies for any complaint mails. Really poor attitude in terms of service.
0|2|some what good phone. good camera no heating problems But cannot connect to very bad customer care. I tried all the numbers given in the website (toll free and local numbers) several times and days no response. Always line busy
0|1|WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY. I ordered a black Mi4i from Flipkart to be delivered in Bangalore -560037. First they send you a defective product that too with different color (bluish grey instead of black, which is displayed on the site). Also I ordered a replacement for the same. 1st they call you 3 days after the promised time. Secondly when they confirm the replacement they as for 7 days to replace the product even when the merchant delivering the product is 12km from the delivery area. Later after 10 days they cancel the replacement without giving any notification. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, POOR LOGISTICS AND ORGANIZATION
0|1|I am very very disappointed with the phone.It is damn slow n irritating me lyk hell. itzz such a mess.Other than camera clarity,everything is worst
0|1|? Hey guys do not buy this cheap Chinese heating pad... i have purchased one mi4i, my experience is worst for Mi India, After sales services are pathetic, they guys even do not reply of your emails. i am following up since 70 days but my problem has not resolved yet.
0|3|i use this phone before three days when i buy heating issue but after update this issue is miner display:-5/5 camera:- 5/5 look:-5/5 sound:-4/5 low sound but good sound bye this fone good fone. after one month i have facing a big problem in this phone call disconnect automatically in this mobile thanks to flipkart to refund my money but after 14 days my money is not refunded.
0|1|Please, don't buy Redmi MI4I, this is my request to all, I got it on 14th July 2015, mobile has not reboot, cannot access anything in my phone even could not back up my data too. I cannot charge my phone and it producing heat too much, everything happened within 20 days. For the problem of the above said I registered my concern to Flipkart but they did not bother of customer's problem, because they got money and sold the product I think. They are telling like parrot instead of listen customer complaint. See how I am in pathetic situation without mobile and invested Rs.13000. I made complained for Replacement (Return ID: 26050089) on Wed 5th Aug, but they did not give me good troubleshooting steps, even though I requested them clearly not to cancel my request until my problem resolved but Mr.Sahid - Flipkart technical department did not listen my word and acted on his own wish. They rejected simply and sent me reason message that below Reply from Flipkart: We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request. Reason: We have shared troubleshooting steps to solve your problem. Because of the rejecting my concern simply, I complained message to Flipkart again on Thursday, 6th Aug for Replacement (Return ID: 26127928), I got reply that Reply from Flipkart: We will contact you by 7-Aug 04.30 pm to clarify your request. Please note your request will be accepted only if it falls within the flipkart return policy” But I did not received any call from them as they committed, instead of call they sent me message that "Hi, we have been trying to get in touch with as requested but we have not been able to do so yet. We will call you back around 08th Aug 2.30 pm to help you with your concern". I think they are postponing days to complete one month and escaping one month free replacement policy. One more thing whenever I tried to call customer care, they are saying just you will get a call tomorrow and wait for our call. Thank you so much Noor E Ayeisha and one more technical staff for understanding my mobile's problem, replaced MI4I mobile. they delivered before the scheduled time. only problem of MI4I is becoming heat in top of the mobile too much now.
0|3|All the features of the phone are good in this price. but their is no proper service provided in the service center.
0|3|Hi guys, have purchased this phone a month ago, not happy with the flipkart service, received a defect phone, after replacement. The phone was heating like hell, but after some updates it has reduced to some level, but not fully eradicate, apart from heating issue the phone is cool, good value for money. Xiaomi needs to do a through check on their product, before launching in the market, also this goes to flip kart even though they are just an intermediary they need to evaluate what product they are displaying on their platform, because in a way it is also disturbing the reputation of Flipkart.
1|1|Mi4i 16 GB was delivered to me four days back. Phone looks slim & beautiful. I started the phone and checked everything. Camera LEV is not working, Head phone port is not working. Data cable for data communication is not working. Battery remains only for a day without using internet. set heats up like anything. I bought it through www.mi.com. The customer service line is always busy as if they keep the phone out of order with a intention. I wrote mail but did not get any reply. Avoid ordering from website www.mi.com. They don't have proper return/replacement policy like Flipkart. .
1|1|When am i going to get this phone??? today 5th August, 2015 is the expected to get and i had contacted with customer care they prefer me that i'm going to get today. POOR DELIVERY AND NO GUARANTEE FOR DELIVERY RIGHT TIME FROM 28TH JULY, 2015 TILL NOW.
1|1|On 19th June 2015 I have brought Mi4i Mobile Phone, There has been a major defect in the mobile, the system does not support internet, I am facing this problem from the day one, Initially I thought this was a problem from the service provider, but when I change the SIM to other mobile, its working perfectly fine. I have checked with all service provider they said there is defect in the device, Kindly request you to look in my case, and awaiting for a positive reply.
0|1|I have bought Mi4i on 9th Jul'15 for my friend (as a gift) and it was deliver on 16th Jul'15, from day 1 we are having issue with the phone, i.e., heating issue, screen blackout issue while dialing a call, phone getting hang and lots of other issue. while contacting flipkart customer care they are giving excuses that we have to download some application and then if it is within flipkart criteria then only they will entertain us. however the application required PIN and it is mentioned that filpkart customer care will contact for the same but we haven't received any call/support from flipkart. I am afraid such kind of practice/service may impact flipkart business in long run.
1|1|Does work properly even after replacement Front Camera faulty.........................................................
0|2|The product is good and I always trust Flipkart for delivery. Even Ekart service was always good, but this time is was not. Ekart people gave me wrong number of the person delivering MI every time, as well as they lost my first product and then never informed me to reorder. After waiting a long I went to ask them why do you message me and then not deliver the product, they kept me waiting for 45 minutes and then said they have lost the product. I give 5 rating for product but minus ratings for Ekart service.
0|1|Dear all, my phone almost 2 months ago and now I sent it to service centre due to no display problem. But service centre are very fewer in Kolkata area. And service experience are too bad, they told me minimum service time almost 20 day's only for display change.. Where other brands only going to 2 to 5 days service time there Mi going to minimum 20 day's service time..it is very bad experience that I have never before.....
0|1|I purchased mobile from flipkart, i raised replacement request within few days after realizing that mobile set has some problem, In this mobile, network connectivity is very poor, if you are in strong signal area, phone has good signal once you move to weak signal area, mobile doesn't have any signal and you can not able to make a call. In this mobile set which i got has problem with MIC, during the call suddenly other side people not able to hear sound. Flipkart rejected request of replacement.
1|2|This is excellent phone but not sure why display didn't work..I need to search service center now :-(
0|1|when first time i put on charge there was smoke and burnt smell. immediately reported but seller is not supportive. defective accesories supplied not a good product
0|1|I din't think that i wud be so mch frustrated with the quality of product delivered. Maybe the piece delivered to me is defected or there is manufacturing defect. But I'm totally dissatisfied..
0|1|Dear Flipkart , I have purchased this set from ur site .I am very much disappointed as this is the worst set of my life .Severe heating issue ,even when i switch off the set battery going down from 80% to 50% in 12 hrs. Its the height of foolishness of XIOMI worst silly chinese mobile maker company
0|1|i am owner of all xiaomi phones includes... redmi; redmi2;redmi4gtab;mi4; mi4 i, . i had taken mi4i in first registration i.e.30th april.but first time a face a problem in mi4i handset'; due to poor hand built. the screen get broken in pocket; without any physical impact. i had used it only one month had deposited on 15th june. i had been informed that we don't have a spare of same. i had contacted him 6-7 time to their customer service centre. but they are still telling to wait for some time ( there is not deadline in time; only use a word wait for more some time from junior to manager). Today i.e. 31/7/2015 date we have not received any handset from ensure service surat nor received any feedback from xiaomi service centre. Also for such a long period they ar not providing standby handset. so i am whole xiaomi user recommending you to not buy any handset of xiaomi.
0|1|whenever device connected to internet after selecting 2g or 3g or LTE network type, it always shows connection timmed out. worst expirence
0|1|The worst mobile in the marker. I have used couple of mobiles and observed many mobiles. But MI mobiles are worst mobile those I never seen before. My child and my friends daughter got injured due to this hear problem of MI mobiles. MI mobiles stands for OVER HEAT problems.
0|1|With high expectation I bought this mobile but totally disappointed. Sound quality is very bad. It gets heated up while talking. Call gets disconnected frequently. Net also gets disconnected often and while roaming every time I have to reconnect, re-start the phone. Over and above, the buttons are inactive (menu, tray and back buttons) and have to switch off and restart the phone . Even after re-starting it's not working for one or two days. Am giving my honest review after 45 days usage. I have complained the problems within 30 days but the flipkart customer service personals were questioning me like CBI Officers and at last they have declined my return request for reasons not known to me. I have written to their resolution team but not received any response. Shit service from flipkart.
0|1|My personal suggestion...not to buy MI products.....its totally a china product...i have purchased this on 1st day of launching and submitted to service center in just 1.5 month ad still waiting to receive......... Customer service is like a full of irritation, on one is ready to listen and provide time line...its like fully china product...dont aspect for any warranty..... i have suggested almost 10 of my friend and out of them 7 are dissatisfied from their service....really very disappointng...just to cross check request you to please visie their service center once.... I you are going to more than rs 10k then pls dont go by the product feature available here....service is also more important....pls rethink before opting this
0|4|good looking and very easy to use. looks rich
0|5|hye guys the product is awsum......at these range no one can stand near u....yar but company ne bhari game khela yar... i also wanted to buy 32 gb........
0|1|I ordered this phone on 14th of july and got it in my pocket on 15th gradually i m realized flipkart provide me a defective phone. I never noticed sound quality due to most of the time i keep my phone on vibrate mode 2nd thing i noticed it's battery when i kept this phone in standby mode and i realized it's just a piece of shit. Flipkart make me fool. I did a complain for exchange or return...since about 5 days their technical and executive team giving different excuses....Flipkart technical team is unable to listen my voice during call everyday but at the same time their executive can talk and everyday they fix-up a call for technical team.....today i was in no mood of listen any excuses so i request him to make me talk with your senior....can you believe they kept me hold for 20 minutes and then their senior hang my phone just saying i will make your call arrange next day... Is it the reason for buying a new phone from Flipkart?
1|2|After lots of research .. i bought this this not worth for money Hw and build quality ok ...but 1.Device randomly boot up issue 2.Proximity not work properly .. First time it work fine after upgrade this is the issue 3.User photo calling issue 4.Caller UI unfortunately stopped issue.. 5.Sometime incomming and out going calls not work I am completely dispointed..... Still I hope for firmware upgrade.. if anything resolve .. i will update.if resolve..
0|1|Heats up a lot (50 C plus). Basic app like facebook hangs. Google hangout doesn't work. Flipkart has good replacement policy, but very strict refund policy. Even in case of such buggy device, I am struggling to return and get refund. (Already got one replacement, and that new replaced peace also has same problems)
0|4|Awesome phone but if by mistake damage ur phone it is gone for life tym....,,, worst service from mi support...
1|1|waste mobile, mbl is heating too much and automatically restarted......................................................................................
0|1|My phone stopped working suddenly and when shown to the service centre, they ask to throw the phone away. This is stupidity! When raised a complaint with flipkart they suggest a new solution everytime i call them. Buy this product only if you wish to suffer.
1|1|IMEI number on invoice is different as on phone IMEI. Flipkart or WS retail selling old phones to users in behind of new invoices. I am 100% sure that the product which i received is returned product of any user that is packed again and sold to me. Very very big bluff. And they still not resolved the issue. Please directly buy from MI or aliexpress not from Flipkart.
0|3|this mobile is best in all. heating issue.but flipkart cheats everyone by keeping fake 30 return policy. im telling you all there is no 30 day return policy at all by flipkart. if you apply for return by giving some issue, they will make us to download smart check app, and the guy will call us, who will convince us like even though there is an issue , he will say it not an issue. Dont even know anything about mobiles, except clear data, clear cache, lol , everyone knows that, when there is an isue first try to solve that issue. again you people named as technicians. please flipkart this is not the way of treating customer. fed up with you people. "moto e", Asus Zenphone5 you did the same thing now with mi4i. he told me to go service center for 10 days for mi4i . then who the hell told you to keep 30 return policy .do you think we are fools. please we are paying you earned money.completely fake plocies. never ever buy from flipkart . its all over . good bye
1|1|I bought Mi4i cellphone from FLIPKART on 7th of May 2015. I bought it to gift it to my brother who visited me approx 25days after I purchased the cellphone. I checked the basic functionality of the phone when it was delivered to me, then the charger and the cellphone was working fine.But afterwards my brother came up complaining that the phone is not charging(when the battery completely drained out). I visited the nearest service centre and they said that some "Hardware is missing" from the device. I had visited the service center and called multipe times to MI call center for my issue. But they failed to provide me proper solution. I also contacted flipkart but they kept themselves out of this saying they can't help once one month lapses.I have been contacting flipkart, Service centre and MI customer support since then. Just because of flipkart "one month replacement policy" I don't want to accept a cellphone that is not even used for maximum of 3 days, though service centre has now repaired the phone and I have the phone with me after almost 3 months. But what is the guarantee that the phone won't get damaged in future. Frustated with poor service of both flipkart and MI.
0|1|got defective peice two times really disappointed and no good service centres available buy other good reputed company product
0|3|phone is ok but it lags in asphalt 8 game, the major thing is speaker loudness is not satisfactory like other review mobile important feature is not full filled in sound department. and I think all android recent mobiles they have some restrictions for sound, any way friends think before buy other remaining things are ok. in camera also they need to improve.
0|1|I bought this phone on 25 July 2015. Used it for three days only and now I have a major problem. The phone shows every incoming call as "Unknown Number" even if the number is saved in my contacts. Such a shit is this. Im gonna return this today only. Flipkart - u faked this phone :(
0|1|I received product in faulty condition. I immediately raised return request on Flipkart site. Flipkart technical team calling me and abruptly disconnecting call without solving problem. They did it multiple times. Worst customer service from Flipkart. :( My phone problems: SIM card is not getting detected Phone automatically restarts after very couple of minutes If if restart phone then most of the time it shuts down and not restart Power button does not work properly Screen does not senses touch properly, looks like faulty screen. Phone starts in SAFE MODE many times
0|1|I have received phone today after waiting for 10 days, 1) I have received wrong phone (which don’t have the imei number) 2) After approval of replacement (phone received after 8 days) 3) Worst service of delivery from flipkart 4) Paid for 1 day delivery charges still it takes 10 day of time to get correct phone delivered.
0|1|can not bay this phone this is very bad hend set.........................................................................................................................................
1|1|I REALLY RECOMMEND THAT DONT BUY AFTER SALES SERVICE IS TOO UNSATISFACTORY .............................................
0|1|I wanted a sleek slim light cheap phone with awesome display and bought the mi4i. [Very much regret the decision now.] I have been using this product for the last three weeks. This phone has been a great disappointment. Here is why 1. Battery drain I hardly get 6-7 hours after a 100% charge ( I DON'T GAME ) 2. Call drops of and has been facing coverage issues a lot, people (and also the flipkart technical support team) tell me my phone is "no reachable". Yes Flipkart, that is an issue with my phone and shouldn't be a reason why you has not processed my replacement for the last three weeks. 3. Heating issues - 3-5 minutes on the call, my ear starts to ache coz of the heat ( you can cook a chicken with the heat produced when you turn Mobile data on, but thats a different case though, can live with that) 4. Flipkart hasnt replaced [all I am asking is a replacement or an upgrade] my phone yet and keep telling me their technical team tried contacting me. Flipkart.. its not just but all my family and friends are unable to reach me everytime they try.. Probably making antoher 4-5 attempts may ring my phone. The ID's are 24407235, 24706801 [Rakesh was the agent from flipkart],and then again Pooja from flipkart today with a new ID : 25319021. They always have assuring words but, the huge question of whether they are going to get my phone replaced remains. ! My hands are tied and am inclined to believe I will have to invest another 13-14 K in another phone as flipkart is just waiting for my 30 days post purchase to get over so that they can doom me. !
1|1|When we received the product, the sim tray was missing. Called up the customer care, he couldn't understand the problem. As products worth more than 10,000 are not permitted in Bihar for delivery, we had received in bangalore at a friends house and the product was not opened for a month. When we received the product, sim tray was missing. And the next day had to leave bangalore. So, couldn't even replace it. So, now will get it replaced within next 10 days.
0|1|Dont Buy Tis Phone !!! . There Is Lots of Problems , TOuch is not working properly SOund is not good pc suite is not working properly hanging a lot bad product . I need to replace my phone but there is no proper response from filpkart. bad experience with filpkart. hate it
0|1|I think this is the WORST mobile. I never seen this type of WORST mobile in my whole life. I want to returned this WORST mobile, So can you tell me the procedure to replace this shit. This is not a mi-4i, I think you provide me shit. In only 35 Days from purchasing date handset not working and you told it's not company fault go to customer care what the WORST service you provide your customer. I really very UPSET from your this service. FLIPKART and Mi 4i you both CHEATED your customer. And the last thing is that I want to replace my mi-4i handset and provide me different company handset you cheater.
1|2|I m purchasing one mobile on online but your mention the mobile included mobile charger and head set but headset are missing. Please arrange the headset
0|3|i brought this mobile on may, before this i have used redmi 1s. comparatively 1s weighs more than MI4i. Pros. Quality of the camera is so good. Multi tasking easily. battery lasts for the whole day. its slim and weighless Cons. nothing much difference from 1s call and notification volumes are low. Wifi receiving speed is low if its in good signal strength too. 2g is waste of time. 3g is ok Yesterday i kept the mobile in my jeans front pocket (its not that much tight pant) and i drew around half an hour in my activa scooter, i didnt have given much pressure to my pant while driving if its activa we can sit aram se. after the drive i took d mobile from the pocket and what i saw was cracked display.till now i haven't dropped my mobile once in the floor. now i came to knw by keeping the mobile in the pocket also makes damages, cracks and scratches. i have used lot if other mobiles too but i didn't find any scratches and damages. so for this one should take extra care by keeping the double flip covers, one screen protector and additional tempered glass in this (Mi4i) they have mentioned its comes with tempered gorilla glass but after the nominal use of this mobile anyone can easily identify the nail scratches and finger prints easily. even if child pressed the display with some power it can break the display. Nothing will comes under their policy if the display is broken. i enquired in the mi authorised service center they are quoting 6800Rs for the display only for spending around 7k for the display we can get n no models in this price range. guys i want to share this to make awareness of keeping this mobile is like carrying a kid, always in ur innermind have to tel do we keep the mobile safe?
0|1|jab se aya tha, tab se complain ki thi, magar Flipkart ne kuch serious nahi liya... ab ye mobile kuch ma kuch problem karta hai...navigation button me kuch toh problem hai..response hi nahi karta...kabhi kabhi chalta hai...aur heating ka toh problem by born hi hai.... ab rating bhi minus mai nahi hai...1 rating bhi bahut jyda hai...e toh electronic chiz hai...par flipkart ko toh service deni chahiye...wo bhi bakvas hai
0|1|fake return policy lot of problem in charging hangs heat like a frying pan.worst experince with flipkart and mi4i
0|1|few pros- good camera, design n screen, UI infinite cons- the worst smartphone i have come across so far! heating is just another issue, the wifi does not work.. every time i have to use the wifi, i have to turn off and on the wifi (sometimes my phone too) at least 15-20 times (that is it wont work until i start pulling my hair and spend good 20-30 minutes on it). the phone hangs, shows glitches, poor sound quality, low volume. and all this within first 24 hours of using the phone. i decided to replace my phone thinking its a defective piece. that was beginning of another horror.. after making some 30-40 calls to flipkart (rubbish customer care), visiting the service centre twice, i got my phone replaced after 2.5 months with absolutely same issues. there is no difference at all, seems like they ve just put a new body on it and send it back. if they cant provide a smart phone with a basic wifi.. they should not sell it at all. so frustrated and disappointed with Flipkart as well as Xiomi. i feel like i wasted 13000 bucks. no star from my side!
0|3|suddenly it flashes no network msg on screen but on top there is full network of bsnl and airtel then i have to switched off then on the mobile then msg disappear what is problem ?????? from this morning , there is no sound from speaker when we attend the incoming call.as well as while making outgoing call , the other person wont listen my voice . when i play video , there is no sound from speaker ..... what is problem ????????? or contact details of vendor for solving the problem... i need help or replace the piece with regards rajesh dalvi
0|5|Excellent product. Everything that you need of a smart phone. Icing on the top is the long battery life!!
0|4|very good product... hope every one buys this....
1|1|After opening the box I was charmed with the look. Sim inserted, fully charged in the night. In the next day after 12 hours, battery all most exhausted. Whenever I talk, my ear feel the heat. Just on the 2nd day it started hanging and opening problem. On the third day I can not view or receive incoming call and cannot disconnect outgoing call. Screen is black. As per direction of Flipcart people, FACTORY RESET done. But problem remains. Now I am hanging and fighting with Flipcart people. No one should purchase this phone. Camera of Redmi 1S was much better.
0|2|We got attracted over advertisement and purchased it. Flipkart delivered in time. But we got a phone with faulty camera. After a long chain of calls and online product inspection and shop visit to prove it a faulty one, we got the replacement. A frustrating experience. Look is good and display is best.
1|1|I revived this product Mi4i mobile phone on 24th July 2015, screen on this was faulty. When i requested for exchange team is not ready to do that and closed my request without any resolution. i am following up with them but no revert.
1|1|charging point is not working :( ......................................................................................................................
0|1|Poor sound , Heating issue , I got exchanged thrice . Failure product . Don't buy this . Not worth for this price . Stop selling this flipkart .
0|1|I feel very sad to mention this review about Flipkart,it was not expected by you flipkart. I ordered and received the product used it for 7 days, the phone is awesome.After 7 days it began to MALFUNCTION and now it is dead,i can understand that phone delivered sometimes can be defective. But it does not end here i requested flipkart to replace me with a new one,so i registered a complaint on 7th July and on 14th July i received a call from courier service that your product was tampered and used by one of delivery boy.What kind of service is this,why you are tampering customers product. And more over i also called customer service for replacement for 3rd time ,they register my complain daily and tell me to call after 24 hrs and confirm whether my complaint is registered or not. Now my daily routine after getting up 9 is that register a new complain everyday. Pathetic,this is not the Flipkart which was known for its service -5 STARS FOR SERVICE
0|1|I have got defected piece and ask for replacement from flipkart but they says to courier the defected product but courier facility is not available at ranchi.Then they say that they will refund the courier amount in my bank account but i didn't get that amount. They keep my money.They are liers.
0|1|After one month purchase front camera gets blurred.Major problem in mi4i in front camera.very bad experience , not so much quality as we expected.over heat as well as fast drainage of battery.Plz before buying this mobile value ur money.Really very very bad experience by buying mi4i mobile.worst phone .presently phone battary completely drained. Now completely shut down how to repair my phone. Any contact number. MI Phone does not help. no service center .
1|1|I was super exited when this product gt delivered. It took 8 days to deliver from the date of purchase(not as fast as it used to be). When I switched ON the phone I was disappointed with the screen quality. Even text was not clearly readable on the screen due to pixelation. Its screen seemed to be of much poor quality than my Moto G. 441 ppi not at all from any angle. Soon I realized that the product is defective when the whole screen turned Green and requested a return back immediately. Flipkart should have quality check before delivering such non-sense product. I purchased this fone in exchange offer. Now i dont have my old fone(which one was in much better working condition) and can't use this one as well. I request Flipkart to take this defective piece back and deliver some sense ASAP.
0|1|Front camera problem within a month very bad sevice. Phone is in service centre since a month and they say that part is not available
0|1|HOT FURNACE, TEMP REACHED BEYOND 48 DEGREE, THAT TIME WE CAN NOT TOUCH THE PHONE. FLIPKART IS NOT READY TO RETURN MONEY, THEY ARE READY TO PROVIDE ANOTHER HEATER/FURNACE IN REPLACEMENT OF OLD HEATER/FURNACE VERY BAD MOBILE FOR USE
1|1|recived phone with defective charger... requested for replacement but not responding. never buy from flipkart
0|1|this mobile is waste of money. I purchase it 20/6/15. after 1 and half month it screen is broken itself when it connecting charging. customer service centre said it not include in warranty. and i meet 5 person that same case at service centre within 30 min. this screen price 4000/-
0|5|# What is the need for releasing tons of updates? # It is an unfinished product / what is the need for releasing unfinished? # xiaomi & flipkart must recall all the pieces of Mi 4i sold # Buyers never buy this product # Lot of issues with hardware & software # Abnormal heating like cooking pan (we can put Omelette etc) # Going to file a case against xiaomi & flipkart at consumer court
1|1|I bought it due to octa-core processor, 2 GB RAM and 13 MP camera. Moto G is far more better than this one even with having low configurations than 4I. I avoided reviews and bought it by trusting flipkart and MI and It was my big mistake. I had to request to flipkart for replacement due to charging issue. Now the replaced one have network issue. A theme loaded by mistake and applied which is stuck. No option to change to default theme. In theme menu It doesn't load new themes even after connecting to wifi with speed up to 4mbps. It doesn't show anything except and error of no network ... I suggest don't waste 13000 for this chines shit.
0|1|Don't buy any product from Flipkart. Flipkart is a Defective products Sellers. And His Customer care department was Careless.. Replace Defective products.. Not refund you for Faulty product. Beware from Flipkart.. Trust Less Flipkart...
1|1|i bought this phone 3 weeks before & since last week it starts showing problems. It was not charging due to some internal fault. when i go to service center i saw this problem was not occurred only with me.many other redmi users had same type of problems in thier phones & the costumer care persons was not resolving anyone's problem. they said,"It was customers fault or company will not claim it. if they want them to resolve their problem they will have to pay them. Otherwise they will not repair it warranty claim. or they said to the customers that,"they can do anything company didnot care about it. pls. i suggest everyone their phones have sevre problems so pls. dont buy them.
0|1|after sale service is very poor..my mi4i accidentally broken my lcd i had given in bhubaneswar service center but now its more than one month... service center says parts not available in india...its will take time.
1|4|i've been using this phone for almost a day now. i can feel no glitches, even the heating problem didnt happen to me, i have'nt updated my phone even then..it is much smarter a phone than the contemporaries even iphone 6. i punched in the wrong state name while ordering, yet the phone got delivered by correct pincode. thumbs up to flipkart for that.
0|1|I got this phone day before yesterday, already have a problem with the display. Screen is showing line marks in all colors. wasted 13k on this.
0|1|I got this phone from Flipkart. The first day itself it had problem connecting to any SIM. Also youtube Videos were not playing. And phone was taking hell lot of time to restart.Not only this , after two days Bluetooth also stopped working.Within the first two days I upgraded the software and factory restarted but nothing helped.I raised a return request for this phone but Flipkart is not helpful at all. The first request they closed without resolving any single issue. Its been already 5 days since I raised return request and no progress has been made to return this defective product.They will call you once in a day and won't tell all the necessary requirements at once.Even raised a mail to resolutions team but they have not responded yet (its more than 30 hours). And then after three calls, they will close the request. First of all , don't go for such phones and even if you want to go don't buy from Flipkart.
1|1|please please do not buy this phone.flipkart is cheating...cheap chinese phone.fake return policy.problem in phone since very first day..
0|1|Flipkart cheats its customers & have a fake return policy. It customer care system is pathetic. purchased the Mi4i mobile, got the defective mobile, called the customer care for replacement & get the feedback that technical staff will get in touch. Call timing is fixed by them & said to be systematic call. But never got the call on scheduled time given to me. On next day Received the call, on which i requested for rescheduling the call as was busy in very important meeting. Also in the evening again called the customer care for same issue & it was confirmed that call will be received in next day. Next day received the msg. that your issue has been resolved & case has been closed. I wonder how they can close the issue itself despite of repeated calls to customer care.
0|1|The phone is awesome, that is the only reason I bought this phone. This review is not about the product - It is about the worst service These guys can provide.. If you have bought this phone already/planning to buy this phone (or any other Mi phone) be prepared to experience the WORST TREATMENT from the service center. My screen broke and tried to get it replaced from one of the Xiaomi Authorized service PARTNER - TVS Electronics Limited - (Order ID 890022728)... Ten days to get the spare is what i was told. Almost after 9 days, today I was told that they need another 10 days to fix my phone (And I have to leave the phone with them and NO Courtesy phone will be provided). Worst customer experience of my life time... Guess what, I am going to get the screen replaced from a local service guy by this weekend (After all I waited 9 days JUST to know how much more time it is going to take to get it fixed). Thanks you Xiaomi for everything!!!
0|1|I bought this xiaomi after a long wait. I was much impressed with the display and quality of the camera. I had already taken this XIAOMI Mi 4i twice to the service center within a month of owning this. Of course like other users have stated this can used in Antarctica as handheld heater...!! Either the Product is bad or flipkart is selling inferior in quality products from Mi. Bottom of the story donot buy this.
1|1|Bekar Mobile Isko khareedaTo paisa dooba ghatiya quality huge haeting charging issue and hanging pblm also isko lene ka matlab kooda khareeda flipkart company bhi bewkoof bana rahi hai goods return ki baat karne kahte hai ki replacement gadbad hone per hoga nahi to nahi sabhi sammanit upbhokta se apeal hai ye dhokhebaaj company hai jo ki janta ko loot rahi hai
0|1|the service center of Mi not so good & parts of Mi is so costly For example Price of mi4i is 12999 but display cost is Rs. 5500 service tax I am not satisfied
0|1|when I open flipkart website this morning they said that deal is about to end. when i moved to the deal page 5000 offer is available for Xiaomi Mi 4i. at when I try to order the price is same 12,999/- No change in it. what a brilliant cheating offer / deal of the day. Great flipkart. You are the perfect one for the Indian customers.
0|1|Day by day filipkart delivery service getting lost their faith of timed delivery. Mobile is good in make & their performance.
0|1|I recently purchased this phone(28 days) ago..firstly flipkart told that i will be provided with a 4g sim but i wasn't..I wasn't worried much.I was using my phone with only 1 sim then,but 2-3 days ago i inserted the 2nd sim and the slot wasn't working...I immediately went to the service center and asked them for warranty,they told that it will cost me Rs.3800/- for the repair..I asked them then for what does the warranty is meant? they kept silence and told me to contact flipkart for a replacement(30 days policy).I called flipkart then,and you will be surprised to know what they called- We are not going to receive the phone and you yourself have to courier us the phone..Now will flipkart take responsibility if something happens to my phone if something happens at the transit? This is a simple trick played by flipkart as they know,nobody is going to take risk of courier his/her phone...13000 isn't a small amount flipkart..I hope u you will lose the market very soon...
0|1|My phone had front camera issue. and Flipkart didn't give replacment knowing that whole lot is having manufacture defect. and MI Service center people behave badly and telling dont come to service center till 15 to 20days.. planning to go to consumer court
0|1|bad mobil................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
1|4|before one month i bought this phone. its very nice and slim overall ok positive 1 camera is very good front&rear 2 screen touch good 3 battery not bad Negative; 1 phone sound is low 2 i feel like phone is over heat 3 if you go online more time server error
1|1|I bought this phone in one of the first flash sales. To begin with, the phone worked well adnd seemed like a great deal. One month after purchasing, the phone began giving me problems. The main issues were that charging worked only intermittenetly and that the phone was overheating. I contacted Flipkart who told me to contact Xiaomi. It turns out that Xiaomi only has 3 service centers in Mumbai, the closest of which is 40 minutes from my residence. I can't get any estimate on how long it will take to fix the phone even though, apparently overheating is a very common problem. There is no way to courier the phone to Xiaomi which means that I'll have to waste 1-2 days of my time going to the service center to get this fixed just 2 months after buying the phone. Heating problem, horrible customer service. DON'T BUY!!! Pay the extra for the 1+1.
0|1|I have purchased Mi 4i on 26 Jun 15 and within one week both the camera has gone and service centre at Faridabad (sec 16) told me that there are lots of sets with us for the same problem....you leave the set for 10 days it will be repaired.... WTF.... Phone is heating like induction plate. Can any body help me out on this issue
0|3|..............very good very nice, super innovation, price is very reasonable, worth buing. no problem at all........................................................
0|5|Great Phone at this price..................Go for it Camera V.Good...................................................... Good Resolution.....
1|1|I have purchase Mi 4i after 15 days i am facing handset hanging problem and also inform to flipkart but they are processing my request to return the product.
0|3|where is my screen protector and case ??????????? .......................................................................................................................
0|2|Not soo good.Over heating at times. Get head ache. may be it is not good in health perspective. High radiations i believe.
0|3|Mi 4i is very good handset , it is very heat pick up during used mobile. can i replace with another mobile
0|1|Heating like a frying pan No games, no web surfing still heating to extent that I can't hold it near my ear. I used the phone for 10 mins going through settings of phone and it heat up considerably. All this when I am 'balanced' battery profile, not even "performance". Mr Hugo, what's the point of all these specs if you cant hold the phone in your hand or keep in the pocket because one would have to visit doctor for treating burns.
0|5|Fantastic item fast delivery Got the product before arrival date in a very good packing condition and excellent service as usual many thanks to flipkart
1|5|i ordered this phone at 9 July, it comes after 15 days and they sent me defected piece. Music player and Bluetooth not working, video player doesn't access. after an month they sent me again this phone. phone was good. but flipkart's service is very poor. they can't solve even legal issues at the time. they always take long time to serve.
0|1|Front camera was not working after using it one month and also some problem in rear camera. Can i replace it or some other way to sort my problem.
0|1|as soon as i switched on the phone..screen started flickering and a green horizontal line is seen moreover the customer service is pathetic,,they tell me to call after 2 hours,,saying its a technical fault.. if u have delivered a defective piece..please take i away on the same day itself...this is very bad as you are delaying the return of my phone,,pathetic service
0|1|Flipkart service is Good.But flipkart needs to stop selling this product. My replace product also having hot condition,flipkart refused to refund my product. SAFETY ISSUE....DONT BUY..DONT BUY. Really wasted money-13K. I am not going to use this phone,since it will burst anytime and your Ears will damage..
0|1|This product is really pathetic due to poor signal receptance and network goes off as and when and once i requested for the return of the same , I got call from seller and giving ridiculous solution and told I am not satisfied .But to my surprise my request rejected stating seller provided solution. This is really pathetic service from Flipkart, never go from Flipkart, they have completely changed what they were earlier.
1|1|On the recommendation of my friend I purchase this Mi 4i phone is having hanging problem and also showing black dots instead of Apps at different times. I have taken that screen shots as proof. contacted to customer care and request to replacement but they are not ready to replace this. One more problem is that there is no service centre in my city and customer care executive giving me advise to visit service centre. How it is possible they dont care.
0|1|my phone is defective.. cnt download playstore.. screen turns blue all of sudden.. i have to keep calling flipkart. Customer service girl who ever called me sounds very rude n cheap.. nt at ail ready to listen me. Just went thru fixed manual nd disconnected the call.. PLZ DNT Buy this phone,, nd DNT buy product from flipkart. I wish you business gt shut dwn.This way you can stand in market. Rating 1.. coz there is no Minus rating system.
1|1|i have registered mi4 that i got just now but i did not find handset in the box along with accessories.
0|1|We had ordered 2 MI4I phones from flipkart. One works absolutely fine and it is really delight to use the phone. The other one does not catch any mobile tower which basically means it does not cater to the basic necessity of a phone. Had been following up with flipkart for replacement from 13th Jul Problem: Barely can catch any mobile signal and heats up within a couple of minutes. I had around 7 calls with Flipkart people, but I had been unsuccessful in convincing them that it is a defective product. They have a call back policy which is a system generated time. All the calls which I have got is during busy work hours (2nd half of the day) or am travelling. Had purchased phones like Moto G, VU Television and other products. Now the trust with Flipkart is becoming weaker day by day. Not sure whether the phone will be replaced or not. DIDNOT EXPECT THIS KIND OF SERVICE FROM FLIPKART
0|1|Dear Sir, It is delivered to me on 3rd May 2015 and invoiced 1st May 2015 on It has a really a big issue of BATTERY Life, it drains in 13 hours irrespective of the usage, even if i turn off wifi and data connection and dont use it, it drains out completely, very worst experience, i buy this mobile hoping that it can be up for minimum 2 days, this device drains very quickly in the night also, Very Worst Experience, MI Company and Flipkart Company Please favour the Consumer by providing correct device..
1|5|Very Disappointing service from Mi you can buy a phone within a Minute but when you require service you have to wait for 2-3 hours in the service centre. I believe MI has worst service centre in Chandigarh No body picks the phone. They don’t have parts available. They don’t have adequate no of people. They even don’t have manners to talk. They are not at all customer oriented. I believe company is not service oriented its only sales oriented. Think Before you buy.
0|3|I have been using 4i for 15 days. It got good looking and holds very good in Hand you can feel the grip but Volume and Power buttons are not so premium and is made of plastic which does not feel nice when you press it. It got some ghost keys and also makes automatic calls from your contacts i didn't understand what kind of technology does MI is using to make such kind of calls. Battery is the most unpredictable, you never know when it will go empty. Camera Front and Back both are good you can click a awesome pictures. Coming to gaming it can handle any sought of game quite easily but Heats a bit. Dont keep this phone beside your pillow while sleeping it may harm your brain because it will heats up in the night and consumes all your Battery while phone is in standby mode. Overall Average phone but you wont feel satisfied with this one. you always feels there is something missing ...!
1|1|I have ordered my phone on last thursday, 9th of july and the delivery date was on 14th of July, whereas it got delayed to 16th of July, but today is 17th of July with still no update from the delivery partner. Very much disappointed with the delivery from Flipkart.
0|1|After the Mi4i hype , I purchased the product in the open sale on 14th July. I received the product the next day in a one day guarantee. But the device doesn't shutdown. It keeps indefinitely processing and this goes on for almost half an hour after which the device shuts down finally n thankfully. If I reboot it the device it shuts down but does not start start on its own. It does not detect SIM in any of the slots. When I called up customer care they say Flipkart technical team will contact me, I need to download some flipkart smartcheck app after which flipkart team will take a look and then approve replacement. I am amazed to know that how can I download an app since SIM is not getting detected. Moreover I was promised a call at precise time 3.52 but I didn't receive any call, rather received a message that they cant get in touch and sent me time for another day. Still waiting for any response from the technical team. Pathetic Policy.Pathetic Service
1|1|Product is nice but Delivery boy has no sense to call the customer and deliver it to the right person. It is a prepaid order, it does not mean the product will be delivered to anyone in office except the customer.
0|1|WS retail, will you confirm my order ????? its still under processing mode. i was expecting it to be delievered by today, but yet no sign of processing..
1|4|Mobile is good only....... but it is a hotbox and some times network problem.... It will heat up with in 15 mintues ......
1|1|Hi flipkart,, This is regarding the issue of My Mi4i which i bought on 9 july sale. i had an issue related with proximity sensor. Everytime i am getting an orange screen when i wake up my phone using the power button though i did not place any screen guard .the phone is also lagging a lot with poor camera quality. Kindly do the needful replacement at the earliest because its causing me a lot of issues and it s high priority.
0|1|PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. Also when i asked for refund they say we cannot. total waste of money.
0|1|The most important thing in a phone is being able to communicate via it and be woken up through the alarms set on it. But, what is the use if the phone dies in just 6 hours with normal usage that includes keeping WiFi on, checking mails and Whatsapp usage. Add to it, it takes nearly 3 hours to charge. I have used OnePlusOne,Moto G and Note 4G before. All these were lasting for over a day. I have asked the phone to be returned, let's see if they understand a genuine concern. Writing this review after 25 days of tolerance.
0|1|I brought a Mi 4i mobile one month back.This flipcart guys give a warrenty product of one year.But that mobile was not working properly display showing blank.Dnt provide such type of fake products.When i contacted the customer support i called 3 times alway they are saying sry sir system network not working properly plz call us after 2 hours. Dont buy such product from flipcart.Even dont provide such fake products to the users flipcart.
0|1|Purchase Mi 4i from flipkart. getting defective product. made replacement but replacement also getting defective around one month now but not using my phone. total waste of money and time.
0|1|i had some network issue ...i ask return product..they call me and tell install app..whats this i cant understand ..its really irritating in flipkart service..i hate it..
0|5|Everything was perfect from On time delivery, nice packing, great looking & working product... Real Value for money. Ready to recommend to others
1|2|too much of lag after very first update. front camera is not working. requested a return 3 days ago but no one has approached me yet.
0|1|LOOK AT THE SAR Value..... 1.290 W/K , The maximum limit being 1.6.... woaaahhh..That's crazy man..u r brain will get fried for sure
0|1|I'm a regular customer of Xiaomi. I bought their MI3, Redmi Note 4G and Mi4I. Their quality is degrading over the years. MI3 was good and Note 4G is bad (Voice quality )and their Mi4I is the Ugly one (The good, Bad & Ugly ) Why I'm calling this Ugly quality ?. I used this phone for a week and Speaker PA system is gone. I have tried resetting it to factory and it still failed I have tried the Hardware tests (Hitting kernel info button 5 times ) and the Speaker calibration test is failing. What's the effect of this failure ?. The Phone doesn't make any sound (No ringtone, no audio, No video ). The phone is like forever in silent mode. I have to take it to service center where they will replace the PA board for extra money. :-( Flipkart order OD103147249250272100.
0|4|mobile look and their feature are very nice better than other handset ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|Exchange offer is not Good It is like cheat with Customer not give Proper Value of Money. Exp: Mi4 is a 14999/- value and you are give only 5000 that not a 1/2 of the Value
1|1|Don't purchase this mobile. This mobile having over heating problem. same features are there in market with low price
0|1|I bought the mi4i 15 days back . on the very first day of using it started troubling me. I launched return request of on the 1st day only but there was no proper response from flipkart. as you have already paid the money so there will be no one to revert you back till the time you take a strict action. even after sending regular mails to flipkart there was no response. Had a word with few of the executives who also made me sure that i have been cheated. Then I have to go to mouthshut to complaint so finally got a call to replace the product but i am looking forward for my money refund as this phone is not worth at all. Please dont buy this phone at even Rs. 5,000/- also. The basic problem this phone has: 1. Heating Issue 2. Network connectivity issue 3. Phone gets hanged. Now new problem has come up it is showing Unkown for every call I receive. I have done the formatting thrice but still the issue remains same. Just check the online reviews once before buying it. There is no one gonna listen to you after you pay for it. So think twice before buying this piece of Crap.. These Chinese are just making a fool of us..
0|5|this phone is nice , no lags no hangs . sound quality good ... I am iphone 6 user ... so its good in this price range.
0|3|not happy with the customer service. I could not get my freebies even though i followed instructions exactly as said by Flipkart. I registered my product with the mi website but they never responded back.
0|2|Hi, I had my Mi 4i handset on 10-july-15. facing the issue on Enterprise mail synchronization. i get hanged and need to delete all configuration and configure once again. is any one having any solution or suggest me the way out.
1|4|This phone I am using from past two months. It is very good. Cameras front and back are very good. Only the problem with Mi is battery. It gets heated soon. Feel scared to touch while it kept on charging. It becomes too hot to touch at the time of charging.
0|1|Have Charging issue i.e. charging hangs at some point & need to reboot your phone to start charging again. Secondly it has been 1 Month of Purchase Charger not working now.???
1|1|Hello Friends, Mi 4i (gray) i purchased and replaced 2 times, bcoz of mobile is heating much while video recording, playing games, video playing (No Internet ON), and i tried to get refund bt flipkart people refused refund request. so guys plz be alert while buying some product from flipkart, bcoz flipkart is ready to sell any product(Original/Duplicate/Defective/Other Products) from register seller with flipkart. and one more thing is Plz Dont buy Mi 4i Mobile.... Thank You
0|1|the orders were cancelled without any attempts of delivery. I opted for a single day delivery and paid for it, but on the day of promised delivery, got am message from Flipkart saying that due to some technical issues, the product cant be delivered on that particular day.the next day, the delivery boy called me up saying that it was raining heavily and hence he would be able to come for delivery. On the same day, i git another call saying that the delivery boy is stuck in the traffic and it will be quite late for him to deliver, to which i agreed with himthe third call was on Sunday asking me whether i can take the delivery on Sunday evening or not. to which i said no and to which the delivery boy said that he will deliver the prodcut on Monday.after couple of hours after the call, i got a message saying the product is cancelled after 3 attempts of delivery.I need an explanation from Flipkart on this situation. how the hell they can say that they attempted 3 times. whereas there was not a single delivery attempt from them.
0|1|It is almost 10 days. I purchased this from Flipcart. Experience is really bad. It’s getting heated up alot. And the worst part is you cannot exchange it. Flipcart will make you fool and will not exchange the mobile at all. They will ask you lots of things to do .Finally If you will be able to proof the defect they will ask you to go Service Center. I stopped purchasing electronics item from flipcart. They are not going to exchange it. Really a worst experience ? Disappointed with the MI 4i and Flipcart Service!!!
1|1|Mi4i (White): 1. There is a LED LEAK at bottom of the screen - 3mm approx., under the back-lit buttons. 2. Phone overheats even with brief usage on 3G/WIFI or Camera. Return/Replacement initiatiated, waiting to hear from Flipkart.
0|3|my Mi is not working properly , it starts hanging , and processing is slow. after 1 month its display is showing blank ... not working properly and sound quality is also too bad and low..
1|1|I like this phone & It was in my wishlist before buying. But after purchase it and use it i found so many problems in it like: Hanging Issue Heating Issue Battery Drained Issue Network Problem And Camera can not capture the perfect pictures in night mode. Please avoid this phone this is not much good in 13000 You can buy any other phone because I'm not satisfied And on the other hand flipkart avoid me to give my refund. The customer care executive misguide me and saying as per smart check apps report your phone is Ok. What should I do. I want to refund it or exchange it with other phone I don't want to use this phone any more at any cost. I'm fed up
0|1|I requested for replacement of the product which have problem with heat and out speaker problem. but there is no proper response.
1|1|BEWARE!!!!! before buying MI 4I please read : I bought MI 4I on 25 June 2015 with in 35 days DISPLAY FAILED, I contacted FLIPKART and MI service center, they replied as mobile was purchased from FLIPKART and as per FLIPKART RETURN POLICY 30 days are over therefore replacement will not be possible and because display failure is a major fault it will take long time for repairing. Since than I am continuously following up with both of them but simply they are just killing time. Better to buy from our regular VENDOR / SHOP as they have some respect and better understanding for that they always ready to help the customer by giving their best services. In online buying all this things are missing and they will refer their RULES & LAWS, in end of the day you are been treated as shuttle-cock and enjoy without MOBILE or buy another one by investing huge money. THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING EXPENSIVE ELECTRONIC FROM FLIPKAT or XIAOMI.
1|1|I had bought the Mi 4i about 2 months back. I have used phones from Nokia, Samsung and micromax before. I really got carried away by the specifications and low price. But little did I know that they have compromised on the phone hardware quality. The phone's display went bust 2 weeks back and I am still waiting for the Xiaomi service centre to replace the same. They say it is a motherboard issue and will need to replace the motherboard !!! I also saw lots of other Mi customers at the Bannerghatta road service centre opposit to IIM BAngalore. All of them had issues like phone not charging or camera gone bad. It looks like Xiaomi is compromising on quality of some hardware parts to bring down the cost... New users please be aware before taking decision to go ahead with Mi phones. Regarding use during the 2 months before the display went bad, Pros: 1. It is a very feature rich phone. It has wifi display with which you can conenct to TV. 2. It does pretty much everything you need and at a low price. 3. Display is a good one at this price. 4. The phone weight is low and is easy to handle. 5. It supports local languages. Cons 1. Camera pic quality is good, but camera is a bit slow. There was one time when the camera got stuck and I had to power down the phone. overall, there looks to be several software issues. 2. When you are using wifi display or browsing for long, the phone gets really very hot. Not sure if something in the motherboard or SoC burnt out due to the heating up Please make an informed decision before you buy. It is possible that my piece is a one off case.
0|5|very nice mobile in this segment i hav never seen such a kind of configuration excelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllentttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
0|3|Purchased Mi4i on 29/05/2015 through Flipkart. Today I observe that it is not getting charged. I dont know whom to show for repair in Mangalore.
0|5|Naad Khula Phone ahe.....Jagaat Bhari....Kata Kirrrr........... In short worth for Rs. 11000 paid during SBI discount
0|1|this is totally sucks , heating like a hell, 13 thousand rupees mobile did not work even for 13 days xiaomi;s service is too bad don't buy it
0|1|After ordering this damn phone from the WS Retail seller on Flipkart at first a displaay defected handset was delivered to me, after passing their tests i was supposed to return the item via courier. And after doing so i was assured to get a new handset against the same so after waiting for 2 weeks a used handset was delivered. It took me a month to fix a deal with the seller as every time they are playing a new game to cheat me. Even i requested them to get refund but they they didnt even accepted my request to change the color of the same Mi4i from White to Grey. So i suggest everyone here to better buy such item from the reliable sellers or a nearby store. Thanks
1|1|I do not understand the meaning fadvantage badge, when i heard from the support executive, that i could not exchange or return the Mi4i which i bought 2 days back. As every one aware, the phone has heating issue, and yet to be fixed by the manufacturer. I have bought with the confidence that, flip-kart will support with it's return policy, if i experience any problem. But it was worst experince, and they are forcefully making us to live with unusable phone. The support team, checked the phone temperate remotely (we could not see it )and sated it's with in the manufacturer defined temperature rating i.e 50 degree. Can any one bare 50 degree temperature near ears and continue to speak. More over the device maintains the temperature even when there is no activities in the phone other than display is ON. I am waiting for an escalation call from Flipkart. I should get it replaced or get my money back. My entire office lost the hope in Flipkart, and I am sure, it's going to spoil their business, Please do not loose your earned credibility just to support one manufacture.
1|4|A nice product from Mi... Using this brand for the first time and I loved it. I got this product 20 days back. Only concern is when I tap its back cover a sound comes like something is broken inside.. dont know that do other people also experiencing the same??
0|4|Good Phone ok
0|1|Fake 30 days return or relacement policy of flipkart Worst ever 30 days return policy If any one purchasing this xiaomi mi4i mobile plz read it carefully or contact me(bindmansi@gmail.com.com) because i will help much any time as i cheated by flipkart First of all fake 30 days return policy 2nd heating will not covered in return or replacrment even the temperature goes over 45 degree if need i will show the result.. Third after open sale xiaomi is replacing sony camera with poor quality samsung camera so beware this Flipkart will replace the mobile only when a smart check application result will show defect and this result not show defect result because this is developed by seller side to reject the return.. So this smart check is also fake done by flipkart but we cant see the result.. The result will uploaded with hidden policy this all is done to reject the return or replacrment... And all customer care suggest the same solution to go to xiaomi service centre but xiaomi no solition will found because xiaomi will At last mobile aspect Pros... Best display ......

1|1|I purchased Mi4i order no. OD002784318166767400 , I am satisfied with overall performance from the product but the quality of product is very poor, my device is fall from my shirt pocket for only 2 times and that too not from full height just from 3 feet only and its main screen tracked and now customer care is saying to replace whole screen and they charges Rs. 9500/- for replacement. How can i expect a product which will not able to sustain such a minor shock, before that i had used number of smart phone from other brands like Samsung, Nokia but i never face any problem, they are such a robust piece that it last for many years. I am very true to my statement not exaggerating any thing. I am very much disappoint with the durability of the product. If Mi4i is so delicate handset its companies responsibility to make aware to customer that take extra care about your handset, make sure you put gorilla glass of high quality. I feel cheated . If any body is really concern about customer's feedback then please do some thing about our comments.
0|2|I had ordered a xiaomi mi4i from flipkart.After some days i found some hardware problems(speaker distortion) so i asked for replacement since the seleer had flipkart advantage.They rejected my request 2 times without my knowledge and 3rd time they said that my period to make replacement request is over but my first 2 request was under that period.Kindly help me.The product delivered was on 6th june and i got an email on 4th july that my request was rejected...
0|1|do not buy this product . no return policy if mistaken by while ordering the product and while seeing spec details. its bit confusing. after ordering u r not authorized to change the product also.
0|1|very worst battery backup.totally cheating with us.pls refund my money very worst very poor device pls take return it.and refund it.
0|1|Dear Concern, I am writing this mail in an unfortunate manner after being suffered so much of frustration and annoyance by your customer care and service center services regarding replacement of my faulty Xiomi Mi4i (Order Id -OD002950680018084100 , Invoice date- 28th may 2015 Mobile IMEI No- 866376029204952 ) that was delivered to me on May 2015. It has severe overheating problem along with camera and speaker troubles. I had registered the complaint with customer care on which they simply ran some troubleshoot system and closed the complaint with a message. However nor the problem was solved and neither they asked the feedback to know if the problem was actually solved on the customer end. Once again I registered the complaint and the same process was repeated again and again several times for whole one month . Later on they told me to take the phone to service center in order to replace it on the spot. However Chandigarh service center refused with a reply that phone is not replaced there and just offered to change the camera. Once again I reported all the matter to customer care. This time they asked to collect some DOA letter from service center. Now, again Chandigarh service centre is replying that they do not issue any kind of DOA.he issued only delivery challan (Attached find pfa..) Nobody is paying any heed and the process is lingered as it is. Till date I couldn’t replace my defected phone and feeling harassed and exhausted by such an irresponsible and unfortunate services of flip-kart. This has made me reluctant to buy any other product from the website in future. Therefore I request you to resolve this issue without further causing any inconvenience and wastage of my time. I couldn’t expect anything worse by such a reputed company. Waiting for your early and effective response.
0|2|Please avoid this phone. Very confusing control and the worst part is battery back-up. It will give you tough time !!!!! Go for bigger screen even if it as lower resolution. Phone hangs when watching movies or playing games. I am not sure on their configuration of Octacore. Performance is bad..Not worth spending this much amount.
1|1|4 times i returned the product due to problems. at last got the refund. 2times i got used product by flipkart.
0|1|The phone screen suddenly went off and the phone is at service center from past 20+. From past 20 days they are saying same thing "screen not available". The after sale service for this product is pathetic.
0|1|very bad product and bad services by flipkart i suggest to every man to not to buy any prodect buying by flip kart and mi4 i is not buying from flipkart

0|1|I have purchase MI 4i on 21st, May 2015 via Flipkart. After using it couple of weeks, unfortunately screen was damage. It has been lying in Xiomi's service center from past one month to change the screen, even it is paid service. Work Order Number: OIA/XM/15/01374 I have tried my best to escalate the issue in Xiomi customer care (Ref No - 321861) but matter has NOT moved and till today phone is waiting for part to be supplied by Xiomi. Customer care is unable to provide specific time to resolve the issue. I would suggest to avoid buying Xiomi smart phones, they doesn't provide any after sales service. After all chines will be chines.
0|1|Don't buy this phone... Har Chamkati Chez Sona Nahi Hoti... I have received this phone on 9th June 2015 and from that time i am receiving hanging issue in it.. I have logged complaint regarding the issue and for the time being service team resolve the issue but after some day issue again persisting ...No return policy
0|1|hanging and lagging in sometime some time camera not open light leakage problem in back button this phone cannot handle 208 mb games contact killer 2 zombies and 58 mb sonic dash epic ui to slow
1|1|i had purchase the Mi 4i on flash sell on 18/6/2015 and product was delivered on 22/6/2015. however one of the SIM slot no.1 of the dual sim was not detecting sim. hence i requested the replacement of the product on 4/7/2015 as this product falls under 30 days replacement garantee with flipkart advantage tag. Flipkart had fooled me for three long days and on 6/7/2015 refused to honor replacement garantee without giving any reason. all this flipkart promise of good servcies are fake and they are fooling the people with chinese crap products.
0|1|HI Guys, I had ordered am mi4i only june 27th i received and started using it,I had faced a problrm with my touch buttons i had mentioned the same to filpkart.But they hadn't showed any intrested to the customer even though i am a flipkart first customer (Priority).And they forcr closing my ticket with out giving any update on it worst flipkart and worst support
1|5|I had purchased a Mi 4i through Flipkart (Order no. OD002784543129355201) on 7th May, 2015. The touch screen stopped responding on 22nd June , 2015. Although I gave it for repair, (Work Order no. 890016498) on 24th June at the Mi exclusive service centre on Bannerghatta Road in Bangalore, they were short on spares and were unable to even give me a date for completion of repair. After an inordinate delay, I had posted a review of my experience on this forum on 6th July. I received a call from the customer care personnel at Flipkart almost immediately and they offered to escalate the matter with the concerned. This was not a mere gesture on their part. Again after two days, Flipkart personnel informed me that since I have not received a reply from the Mi exclusive service centre, they were arranging a replacement for the defective handset. On 10th July, I collected back the handset from the exclusive service centre at Bangalore. While collecting back the handset, I was told that the handset is repaired. However, to my dismay, I realised that the same problem was repeating, although intermittently (especially after using the phone for 10-15 mins). However, I am extremely happy that Flipkart arranged a replacement for the phone even though the handset was slightly over the one month replacement policy of Flipkart. The unpleasant experience due the product failure has been more than compensated for by the fair and supportive approach adopted by Flipkart. Any product may fail but the prompt support rendered by Flipkart increases my confidence in their ability to service customers. Such responsiveness from Flipkart makes one's online shopping experience a delightful one indeed. Thanks to Flipkart.
0|3|I received this phone on 14 June 2015 . It works well for first 2 weeks and then i start facing issues . They are : 1.)Touch is not responsive sometimes. 2.)Battery is not getting full charged even in 4 hours and phone is getting heated badly after connecting charger. 3.)The severe problem i am facing is with mic as voice is not going to the receiver sometimes . I had logged a case with flipkart and waiting for a response. Flipkart is asking me to courier back the faulty MI4I on my expense to Bangalore address. Once they received it , they will dispatch the replacement . So think before buying from flipkart as if any issue happens after your purchase , the replacement is a time consuming and difficult process now. Days are gone when flipkart provided doorstep replacement. So i just suggest not to buy any product from flipkart anymore after their return policy has changed.
0|1|Poor handset- Super heating issue and battery drain out problem. Really felt bad when i called flipkart that my 6 days new handset is having such issue. They said what can we do " we don't manufacture mobile" take it to service center. Best part is the flipkart return policy- After writing 10 emails and n numbers of follow up flipkart took back the poor handset.
1|1|Camera was bad Quality....But Mobile Looks Good....I Didn't Recommend This Mobile To Friend.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
1|1|No Signal Strength...No data connectivity.. Nothing worth to buy this phone. Do not waste money. Heating issue. Phone call gets auto rejected. No service centre around. So better not to go with MI 4i.
0|2|over heating and front camera is not working flipkart 30 days return was fake
0|5|My 10 Days Experience with Mi4i..It's working Great.... I have using heavy Apps bt it doesn't hang.... Design is Awesome....
0|1|With in near one month of purchase this phone it started hanging,calls are not made properly.Can any body tell me that how can i return or exchange this phone with another brand,or suggest me that should i go in consumer forum.
0|4|Dear. My mobile's camera front is not working well. Kindly exchange my mobile MI 4I. Kindly do action further. Do not miss it.
0|1|My Review: Extremely poor Hardware Quality & After sales service. Bought this product around 40-45 days back. Problem description: Distortions while listening to phone calls. Customer Care Experience: Flipkart customer care executives installed some App to detect problem but could not find any issue saying this could be some Hardware issue & Product cannot be returned. Thereafter submitted device at Gurgaon's Service center in sector-14 within one month of purchase, they fixed it but again issue reoccurred. Submitted it again & issue reoccurred after some days. Now Flipkart's conflict resolution team is not responding even when i am asking for replacement. Though it has exceeded one month of time limit for product being returned but as i submitted device at service center for addressing the issue in one month of purchase & still issue is not fixed, it must be replaced because there is some manufacturing defect in device. More than the product it's Flipkart's after sales service that is simply pathetic.. Also, Heating issues are there with this Phone & u get the Xiaomi update but that also does not solves the problem. Considering buying new mobile & this time big no for "XIAOMI & FLIPKART"
0|4|I order this phone throw flipkart and got a deliver in next 3 days, it is very good ,light weight ,with the latest feature.
0|1|After starting the voice call, microphone is not working. As per the return policy they should replace the defective device with the new working device but they rejected the return request. I am totally disappointed with flipkart and the seler
0|1|phone is cool but after sales service is pathetic.................................................................................................
0|1|After using this Phone for 2 weeks the front camera image always faded away with tiny dots, then i`ve made a complain with a Return Request, after 2 days I got an email stating that my Return is rejected by seller. I believe there is a 30 days return policy and 1 year manufactur`s warranty too. How could a seller Reject a return request so easily without any contact between a their buyer ? Anyone out there with the same problem ?
1|1|I purchased this phone on June 6th and got it received on June 8th. I do appreciate Flipkart for the fast delivery. My first impression was good with the phone. But I was forced to change my mind with in few days .I started getting a loose sound while tapping close to the rear camera on the phone.It happens when ever I place the phone somewhere. Sounds like some thing is loosen inside. I asked for a replacement and got another one which flipkart claimed to be a new one. But it has 3 lot number stickers which indicates that the product have been returned many times. Even the one I received has more noise than the first one. Even if I shake the phone im getting that annoying sound. I straight away asked for a replacement. I got a call from a flipkart agent (whose name I dont want to mention over here). He was very argent towards me. He straight away said that he cant replace the phone. He asked me to get in touch with the service center and get it fixed. As I said that Im going to escalate this case, he laughed at me and said "do what ever you want, we wont give you a replacement" Spending 13k and getting a defective one that too a refurbished one is not at all acceptable. Flipkart, you are a loosing a loyal customer over here.
0|1|Bought this product from Flipkart , Took a long time than normal delivery , USB cable was missing from the BOX, Never expected from Flipkart . Its really frustrating . Never buy from Flipkart.
0|1|Flipkart service is too warast.I purchased mi 4 mobile. it is over heating at charging and discharging with in half day. i put return request for new piece. without contact and discussion they rejected my request. so don't buy in flipkart.

0|5|I placed a return request on Sunday and received my replacement parcel on Wednesday just 3 working days !!! I'm so deeply overwhelmed by such a great customer service. Why would somebody care to courteously in terms of reverse logistics ?. Only flipkart. Great shopping and experience always and wish you perpetual success.
0|5|Awesome delivery and service also excellent product ,it is really good than other web link servicesabsolutely fine product and service
0|1|I have ordered this phone and flipkart delivered a defective product with 2 days delay. I wrote several emails to their customer care and finally received the phone in which speakers are not working at all. Not able to hear anything with speakers. Camera when I start, it give 'system error , restart the phone' message. I tried to return the phone and flipkart wants to run a smart check to check the issue before even considering for return. And they have a very stubborn attitude that they will run the smart check only from 10am - 7 pm to see the problem and they will not be able to process the return request without smart check. And we have to be in internet zone to run the smart check!! Bullshit gimmick from flipkart!! Very bad experience. Don't buy anything from flipkart. I bought several things from Flipkart and for the first time I faced issue and I now know their real customer care!!
0|1|DNT EVERY BUY THIS PHONE. heating issue, net does not works, very bad phone i had ever seen GUys please dnt buy this phone,

0|1|The phone is hanging if we play music , i raised return request for 2 times with the same reason in 30 days ,the declined my request every time. the technical person asking me to do the reset factory defaults to resolve the issue. But very frequently i am getting the same problem.Very very poor support.I am disappointed with this product from flipcart. i never faced any issues with other gadgets..

1|4|I have been using this Mobile since last week, the features of this mobile are awesome. I am impressed with them. But I felt very sad when I see the flipkart site offering the same mobile for 10% off for the SBI card holders with out registrations :(. This thing I couldn't expected. Rest every thing is good.
0|1|Firstly, the phone's charger (the plug part) stopped working after 3 days; so, i had to bring out my iphone's charger plug for charging. Then, within a week, the phone stopped charging and now, it charges on its own whims. It has happened to me at least 5 times when the phone refused to charge and then start charging only after it had completely died. Two days ago, i dropped the phone and its screen broke (I have dropped my iphone a thousand times and it always survived, while this one couldn't take a 3 feet fall!!). Now the panel buttons are not working and I have to take it to the service centre to get it fixed. Never buying an Mi phone again. No complaints with Flipkart, though. The product was delivered in proper condition and before the maximum time indicated.
0|3|Dear all, MI4I phone is good at this price and you can buy it..!! But be careful don't PrePaid for any product on Flipkart, My recent experienced was really bad ...If you pay advance against your shopping than Flipkart will use Slowest and Cheapest Courier company like: Delhivery to deliver product at your doorstep.. Specially Delhivery is poor courier company they will not provide any correct tracking and also will not respond on your tracking related inquires.
0|1|I had purchased 2 MI 4i mobiles. Its getting heated very fast. I told them I do not need and no need of replacement, just refund the money as a flipkart vouchers. Customer care guys says, heating up to 45 degrees is as per the standard. Its not an issue. so fed up of using the handsets, I lost 26,000/- guys for this junk handset. Imaging friends, How can you keep a handset with temp 45 or more inside your pocket. It is no where mentioned in the return policy too. Its not same flipkart as we saw 6 months back. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART.
1|5|Overall good mobile in this amount but I am very unhappy with MI Special freebies for Mi users. still I am waiting for it but did not receive any response for the same.
0|5|Great product from Mi. Front camera is very good for taking selfies. It was the first time when I am very unsatisfied by the flipkart delivery. Unexpected delay in delivery and not even informed when delivered at my office reception. The delivery was made through Delhivery.
0|2|I ordered Mi 4i on 30th April 2015 and phone got delivered on 9th May 2015. Mi 4i has pretty compelling hardware specifications at given price, but phone's software (MIUI) is very unstable. If phone's software is not stable enough, then it doesn't matter how good is the hardware. I am listing some of the problems I am facing with Mi 4i & these are serious issues. You should think twice before going for Xiaomi Mi 4i. 1. Over heating: Everyone is aware of over heating issue with Mi 4i. Xiaomi claims they have fixed over heating issue in the latest update (MIUI 6.5.6.0), but I don't see even 1% change after upgrading to latest software. Phone still gets heated when I am on call or playing games. 2. Random reboot: I have encountered couple of random reboot incidents with this phone & worst part is this will happen when you are on call ! 3. SIM inactivity just after updating the phone: Each software update cycle takes almost 30 to 45 min which is a very long duration. Xiaomi has released 3+ software updates since they released phone in Indian market which apparently tells you that MIUI is not stable yet. There is a next level problem, each time after software update I face SIM inactivity issue. Phone just refuses to detect my SIM card. Problem goes away after multiple reboots but still it is annoying. 4. Random behavior with Google now: I am facing this particular issue after upgrading my phone to the latest upgrade MIUI 6.5.6.0. Phone suddenly behaves randomly, during normal operation it opens multiple apps (cached apps) and more often it opens Google Now app. This happens almost 4~5 times in a day !!! and when Google Now app gets opened phone just refuses to accept any input from buttons it settle downs after few mins and then it accepts input from buttons. I had to turn off Google Now, since then phone is doing slightly okay but still sometimes I face this issue. Google's applications are not seamlessly integrated with MIUI there are some issues with Google Now notifications also.
1|1|its Pathatic...how can any one use the phone with out a card Tray...? I do really appreciate the logistic people they delevired the item before expected date but the seller WS retail do'nt have commen sence to add the Card Tray... now i cant use my phone as the card tray is not available in the market and even Ear phone is missing....?? FlipKart sort out this issue....?
1|1|1) This mobile is heating and taking log time for charging 2) some times apps are hanging 3) some times apps are closing automatically
0|1|The product is not as expected. There are various problems as listed below . 1. Problem with speakerphone which becomes normal noise even after so call SW update 2. Auto dial to numbers in last dialed list 3. Auto opening of Camera while talking most of the times (without a touch) 4. Heating - Get unbearably heated with 3g on or using any application like camera etc. I am looking forward to change /replace it. Request Flipkart team to help.
1|1|Do not buy this phone,waste of money and time even looking at this phone.... It gives a frequent abnormal shut down,heat up too much and this people cant do anything to help you, I went to the service center they just formatted my phone and gave back and the very same day the same problem starts again ,more than 15 times a day when I called up flipkart they said your grace period is over so they cannot replace or refund I need to go to the service center. This people only make you fool they say call up service center and service center says call up flipkart and when spoke to flipkart they asked me to go to the service center and get the work sheet and email us and we will replace your phone but guess what I get call after 2 days and I get told that my phone cannot be replace. This People are a Piece of shit all fake promises. Please Please Please do not buy this phone........ I would not even prefer giving 0 star. poor quality phone.......
0|2|The above phone is not working software struck cant restart when phone to this no ringing but cant talk Pls hep me for the replacement Sasikumar
0|4|I have purchased mi4i phone through flipkart. The phone is quite good. features are good. Only thing is that it does not have colour variant. Head Phone is not available with the box. Delivery was excellent. Anyways the phone is very good.
0|1|MY FIRST MI4I WAS HAVING POWER ISSUES IT WAS GETTING SWITCHED OFF WITHIN 2 MINUTES , THEN I HAD TO MANUALLY SWITCH IT ON . MEANS YOUR PHONE IS OFF EVERYTIME YOU TAKE IT OUT TO COMMUNICATE. DUE TO UNABLE TO PERFORM TROUBLESHOOTING FLIPKART REPLACED MY PHONE WITH NEW ONE. WHEN I GOT REPLACED PEICE I FOUND THAT SIM SLOT 2 IS NOT WORKING IN MY SO CALLED NEW REPLACEMENT PEICE,SO I RAISED A RETURN REQUEST AGAIN .AFTER SUCH A LONG TROUBLESHOOTING AGAIN ( WHICH DID'NT WORK ) FLIPKART REPRESENTATIVES ARE STILL WAISTING TIME ON TROUBLESHOOTING & I BELIEVE MY Rs.12999/- IS WASTED ON CHEAP MOBILE. FLIPKART PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR MONEY IS HARD EARNED ,
0|2|Same issue twice. Battery not charging on connecting with phone charger and finally powered off for lack of power. Second time requesting return. No option for money back -only option available is to request for a new piece.( new piece ?-repaired piece I don,t know). I am waiting for call back tomorrow.
1|1|No where it was mentioned that the product does not have a memory card slot. I got carried away with the hype and ended up buying a product which does not satisfy my requirement. Not only this I request them to change a give me another phone with a memory card slot immediately after opening the box. I havent even inserted the SIM.. but to my dismay my request was bluntly turned down. Not only this the block buster phone boots up so slow and hangs a lot.. if this is the characteristic of Octacore processor i would prefer not to recommend it to anyone. Overall I am highly dis-satifiesd with the stuff..feels like cheated..
0|1|My phone is getting heated more than 45 degrees and both Xiaomi and Flipkart have learnt how to cheat customers very well. They have well trained representative's to handle this situation also with SmartCheck app, Customer service centre, etc., I don't know how could this phone would be the dream launch phone for Hugo Barra (VP of Xiaomi). Initially he reacted after hearing the heat problem, later he went silent thinking that the problem is solved. It's very unfortunate that a VP of company is saying false news and promises and taking this fake phone multiple nations. It takes time to earn and build the customer trust, and here Xiaomi have lost it dramatically and I'm sure people those who are suffering from this heating problem would have the same opinion like me. If Hugo Barra is reading this feedback, he should stop selling this phone further and cheat people and think about people those who have purchased it and suffering. He is making business with people's hard earned money by promoting a fake phone. Those who are reading this review, please do not purchase this phone for high end hardware spec, it's trap to hell. Cons: - Using phone app to make/receive calls phone will heats up - Using camera app heats up - Using chrome browser more than 5 mins heats up
0|1|Do not waste your money. I was as confused as you are before buying the product and thought of taking chances. It was day 2 when it overheated and i have turn it off for couple of hours. It's day 20 and it has stopped charging and the Seller/Flipkart has refused to return/change it. it's a typical cheap Chinese phone.
1|1|The phone lags, gets heated and makes a progressive irritating sound on opening an app. Worst service and the worst phone. Please allow me to return the item.
0|1|i have used sony and moto but this is worst in internet handelling u shuld not even thinkk about 2g on this phone and also hangs on camera . really disappointed
0|1|Excerpts from a call to CSR Me: I have so and so issue with Mi4i CSR: I understand your concern, but women empowerment is great. Me: I have called 5 times to CSR but my issue is not resolved CSR: I'm sorry to hear that but did you know that empowerment of women is necessary? Me: Can you atleast tell me when will i receive that call i've been told i'll get so i can repeat the same story to another person all over? CSR: When women are empowered the world will have better phones. Me: Please escalate this to someone else who can say something else other than women empowerment like parrots CSR: Sorry sir, my senior is just another parrot who will repeat the same thing but is paid more than me since he's been repeating women empowerment for much longer than me. Since i was tired of talking to parrots i decided to say something here in the product review page. 1. Over heats even when in idle mode 2. Proximity sensor conked up. Sometimes mute and other occasions the hold button is pressed and i feel like an idiot talking to myself. 3. Compass screwed up 4. The back/return button falls into an infinite loop and never gets out of it 5. More than half of RAM is always consumed. 6. I was left with about 7 GB of ROM when i un-boxed the piece and hadn't installed a single app. 7. New issue that i faced yesterday was that the phone stopped charging and i had to reboot for it to work again. That's my option in most of the issues this piece of S**T offers. P.S. - As compensation for the traumatic experience of buying things from flopkart please don't give me a gift card worth 500 but i will accept an Apple I-phone 6 plus if you insist.
1|2|I purchased Mi4i a month back and i see after few days of working ok., now the wifi is showing connected but actually internet is not working on wifi. It though works on Mobile data. I'm very disappointed with this malfunction. I want to return this , what to do ?
0|1|I bought this phone online Xiaomi Mi 4i . It was working extremely well for last 15 days. Suddenly, the screen gone off . I tried to switch on but no response.
1|2|I Had problem on connecting wiFi If I connect to nearest wiFi Band. It comes saved and then after it shows connecting connecting but it will not connect then it shows authenticating problem. It is the problem in my phone on connecting wiFi.
1|4|Vide order no. OD1072380488015200, I had purchased Mi4I on 30.04.2015 from Flipkart. The display of mobile had a watery scar from the inside. Since the handset was doing otherwise well, I did not make any complaint and ordered one more handset(Mi4i) for my daughter on her Birthday(order no.OD202939358759151100). After unboxing the handset it was noticed that alphabet 'S' and 'Z' of virtual keyboard on sceen were not responding after repeated attempts. I made a complaint and requested the Flipkart to replace the defective handset. Flipkart informed be that problem shall be sorted out soon. Some technical person (probably from the seller) prompted me on phone to follow his instructions stepwise, but the problem was not solved. He then informed me that I will receive a message on my mobile and the problem will be sorted out.To my utter surprise, I received a message from Flipkart that the seller has disapproved my return request as the issue has been resolved between me and the seller. But the fact is that nothing is done by the seller or the Flipkart to fix the issue so far. Without functioning of virtual keyboard of mobile, the handset is almost dead. SO THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING Mi4i from the Flipkart.
0|2|the first phone received was not working. No network found. Flipkart did not respond properly regarding replacement. After a lot of followup and some threatening thya finally replace after more than 15 to 20 days time.
1|1|Called Flipkart guys, several times but no call back!! Ensured regarding return of the mobile phone!!!!The handset gets heated up & no support was rendered for the same.
0|1|this guys are cheated public its very bad phone its going very immediate heat , its very poor hearing sound don't buy this phone guys.
1|1|Product is very bad and seller fipkart is cheating with customers regarding support........................................................
0|1|Facing heat issue with this product. I have placed a return request, so flip kart executive called me and said as per mi specifications below 50 degrees of temperature is also a normal behavior., So return policy is not applicable. I Dont why flip kart is selling these type of products also. This was the worst mobile I user ever, also worst experience with flip kart.
1|2|delivery is going too late .... i can't wait,,, for this product ,,please do something...........................................................................................................................................................
0|1|Flipkart will replace the mobile only when a smart check application result will show defect and this result not show defect result because this is developed by seller side to reject the return.. So this smart check is also fake done by flipkart but we cant see the result.. The result will uploaded with hidden policy this all is done to reject the return or replacement... And all customer care suggest the same solution to go to xiaomi service centre. representatives cancel return requests on one superficial reason or other
0|1|i'm having hard time returning my Mi4i phone that I bought. First of all I got a used charger in a sealed pack . After 1hr of charging the phone gets only 10% charged. secondly lot of call drops, bif problem. Friends complained that they are not able to reach me for a long amount of time. My calls were not going through for good amount of time. Pathetic customer service - I got 2 calls from customer service but no resolution coz they dont know what to do. They are giving me all reasons on how not to return the product. They are advising me to show the phone to a retail outlet I got an SMS with the customer service number, however they cant help either. They will only tell you that some other person will call you the next day , since all technical folks are busy or not available.... Please be advised not to buy this pathetic product from FLIPKART. i'm not sure how flipkart policy is for other products, but it is really bad for this product.They are literally locking you here by neither replacing the product nor returning you the money.
0|1|there is a lots of problem in mi4i .i.e. mic , speaker and service provided by flipkart for return this product is also third class...I suggest every one don't buy it.. I give my rating to this product is -1
0|1|problem faced 1 Hanging 2 Call Dialling problem 3 Heating a lot 4 Worst service providing. From last 22 day they are only transferring my calls to technical department and every time they are disapproving my returned request and asking me to download check it app. From last 22 days the same time is been followed by them 5 They are not able to resolve the problem. 6 They are not returning nor replacing the phone.
1|4|Build quality, Display every good. Even camera works good. All over good product. Worth money...
0|1|i was waiting for this phone till its first open sale started and now when its in finally available in flipkart they are not giving their delivery in kanpur why is it so, i am really disappointed with flipkart this time
1|4|I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 28 JUN 2015 STILL IT IS NOT REACHED TO ME.... STATUS IS SHOWING PHONE IS IN BANGALORE ITSELF BUT DELIVERY MAN JUST NOT DELIVERING... IT SEEMS FLIPKART IS HAVING NOW TOO MUCH OF BUSINESS AND THEY DOT CARE CUSTOMER....
0|1|Battery heating issue and flipkart don't take any responsibility to help customers, they are just selling the product and earning the profit.
1|2|Sony/Samsung IMX214 Camera? What is this now they get to add what type of cameras they can keep . how am i suppose which one i get ? is there way i can choose this?
0|3|not a gud fone .......Dont waste money buying ths...its a heater that can be used in winters and hthis fone hangs so much that u cant imagine its aa total waste....
0|1|I purchased Mi4i from flipkart last Month during Launch hoping that it would turn out good, but all my expectation went out in vein after pathetic experience with flipkart. I did not used this mobile for almost 15 days after delivery assuming this won’t give me any problem but after hearing some -ve feedback on Mi4i I opened the phone the moment I switched it on it got updated on 22nd May soon after few camera clicks the phone heated up such a way that you can't hold the phone on your ears. then I requested for exchange 4-5 times online but the flipkart approached me 2 and told me to install some bull shit app called smart check to verify and they keep saying the temperature is normal according to the app. So I requested them to send an agent to experience the heat the phone is causing. they don't even respond to my words they just dropped the call. it has been 45 days now still the phone is with me unused for even a day. I spent 13K for no good reason making me think weather I will purchase anything from flipkart in future… Nooooo ? Sooo friends I would advise no to buy any mobile atleast from Flipkart it will turn your life like you never expected .. not in a good way though ?
1|2|flipkart sent a message on the delivery date saying my order has been canceled by the seller, i was eagerly waiting for the phone and on the delivery date they pulled off , way to go flipkart
0|4|I really want to buy this mobile. I read all the review and no one give a review how much SAR value of this phone. Some one pliz tell me the SAR value of this mobile.
1|1|Issues: 1) Speaker phone volume is very low as compared to Mi3 2) Phone gets heated pretty soon and flipkart says upto 45 degrees is OK....Can't beleive my ears 3) Signal issue both voice and internet, intermittant signal issue I upgraded from Mi3 to Mi4 but it looks IT WAS A MISTAKE and flipkart person speaks politely but says this is per the manufacturer specification HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTED. PLEASE DONT BUY
0|5|I purchased Mi 4i on 30th May but unfortunately it was a defective piece. The earpiece did not work after about 1 week of nominal use and I could not hear anything that the other person talks. I placed a return request with Flipkart and received calls from Flipkart to check and resolve the issue. But once they found that the issue is genuine, they immediately accepted to replace it. The way Flipkart handled the whole issue was very good and I received the replacement in 1 working day (replacement request accepted on Saturday 20th June evening and I got the replacement phone on Monday 22nd Morning). Absolutely 5 stars for Flipkart. As for the product, I think there is no QC done on all the pieces that go out of Mi's factory. Some pieces work great whereas others have issues. I hope I will be lucky enough to see the new replacement product working fine. As I said earlier, I am giving 5 Stars for Flipkart only and not for the product.
0|1|I baught my Mi4i on 19th of June. Hats off to the one day delivery inspite of the heavy rain. I am facing some software issue, My phone is restarting on its own every 5 minutes. On calling Flipkart, they tell u to wait for some STP guy, who forgets to call u. If u ask for a replacement, they again divert you to the same guy, its frustating to buy a new phone and be not able to use it. I cannot rate the phone as i am not able to use it due to the software issue. Below rating is for there irritating replacement policy
0|3|pIzz heIp me shouId i receive it or give return back i m confuse now between mi4i n azus zenphone 2 what i shouId do teII me n interestIngIy today id the deIivery date
0|1|Product I received was a used one charger to be specific, device was fair enough but this is not the right way to deliver items
0|5|This Phone is Not Available On Indian Market But Flipkart Provide Me in One Day Time Thank A Ton i wish i buy everything through Flipkart Only This Phone Themes Was Awesome will give this product 100 out of 97 Marks
0|1|wanted to cancel the order before it was recieved but flipkart tricked me by removing the cancel option.This does not match even the flipkart policy of cancellation before delivery.Thumbs Down Flipkart!
1|5|IS THIS IS GOOD PHONE ANYONE TELL ME........................................................................................................................................................................................ ............................................ ...................................................................... .....................................
1|1|I purchased the mi 4i(grey) on 18th of june which was the day of flash sale after a lot n lot of waiting for this phone!! I was very excited n happy because i thought i got the best phone in this price range. On the day of the flash sale flipkart sold this moblie for 12999/- without a single offer (the white model of this phone was out of stock still flipkart was giving a airtel 4g sim free). But today when i opened flipkart app i saw a huge number of offers loaded with this phone which includes exchange offer (which i really wanted), discount on sbi debit n credit cards (which all people want) and so on.... I am not angry rather am very upset because i never expected flipkart to do such thing with me. I am a loyal costumer and i purchase most of my gadgets from flipkart. My point here is if flipkart is selling this phone on big app day i.e. today with so many offers then why hold a flash sale just before 4 days and sell this phone with no offers to the costumers who have been eagerly waiting for it???? "wait kiya acha kiya" thats what flipakt is saying everywhere. I had already waited way to long and i am sure i could have done it for few more days. I am really disappointed with flipkart for playing such game with the hearts of the innocent costumers. I have lost my faith and i dont know what to do. I would conclude by saying that the phone is great as well as the flipkart service. But since today morning i feel very bad n cheated. what "i am wishing for" today is a reply from flipkart explaining why did it do such a thing with me?? one star is for the games flipkart is playing with us.
0|3|Hi guys Mi 4i its realy 100% perfect clarity but the main problem is always showing servor error message while use playstore & default browser what is the reason help me pls i tried all network same problem will come
1|1|Its been a month now since am dealing with my annoying new phone (Mi4i). Xiaomi has used a very good strategy to sell their product through flipkart and indirectly exploiting the consumers with a fake product so call "Xiaomi mi4i". This product comes with lot of issues and with only few attractive features that get attention of the customers. Some of it major issues are: A. Defects in the functioning of external buttons. B. Sound defects, where in the phone fails to sense the earphones at times. C. Long hours taken by phone to switch off. (Happens on a random basis) D. Internal screen defects, which slowly hampers the main screen of the phone. Since, now I have mentioned these issues above. I would really appreciate filpkart for understanding the issues which were faced on my device initially and quickly got a replacement for the same. However, the replaced product after few days started showing its true colours just like the previous one!! A sincere thanks from my side to flipkart for taking back my return request again and as promised by the 1st Technical expert to refund the money for the same. Today I realised why Flipkart is one among the best online shopping websites and also for being listed in the Stock market. Keep up with your Good Service Flipkart!! Just a quick suggestion: Please be aware of such companies and products that can hamper the Brand image which you have created!! Ensure you remain the best by dealing with the best!!
0|3|Perfect Phone if there is no heating issues. And I have noticed two phones with light leakage at the bottom ( You can able to observe if you check the phone in full dark ). Those are Phone manifacturing defects. Flipkart understood my concerns and returned my money. Many Thanks to Flipkart.
1|1|Flipkart wale ...dikhate kuch our he or bhechte kuch or he. mene gray phone order kiya or mila muje white phone. What is that!!! is that flipkar Policy?? or Jab mene return ki Request ki tab bolte he ki ...return nahi hoga ab apko white hi mobile rakhna hoga...i know very well esa kyu kaha..because.. Seller of this Mobile is "the WS RETAILER " Wo Banda Flipkart ka he..so usko jo karna hoga wo hi karega..apni to sunega nahi.. no now i will never buy any thing from Flipkart. I will suggest to my group this same matter ..no stop online shopping...
0|5|It was amazing to get the mobile phone within a day! I really appreciate eKart Logistics for delivering the mobile so soon. The delivery guy was friendly and seemed to passionate towards his work. Great job!
0|1|this product is very bad, whenever long chatting then the phone heated and switched off...god knows when the phone is on....it happens only 4th day of the purchase..
0|1|Unsatisfied with after sales service and product quality is very poor ...............no service at all............one small mistake and total loss of the product.
1|1|Hi Flip/Airtel When we do not have 4G across nation then what is the use of it and for provider like airtel who have such a poor service for 3G, how can they claim giving 4G in Delhi. this is possible only in two manner either their engineers have not studied about 4G or they they have studied 2G twice and thinking we can give 4G also. Beautiful thing about provider is their Gold customer support. Their main aim is to meet the SLA not service. Call shall be closed with in time irrespective of customer's problem been solved or not. now let me tell you something on courier the red courier service or red express, i don't remember the name exaclty but the problem is individual has to go in person to ensure on time delivery else 10-15 delay is very common. And by any luck if you get a chance to see how shipment are kept in ware house you will shocked. visit red express courier at Noida sector 5. I would suggest flip for choosing the promo before attaching them to the product, somewhere or the other flip's name also associated and also they shall only take ISO certified courier agencies.
0|1|Phone received in time, no doubt Flipkart is a good courier company. About Phone : There is some problem in the SIM slot. Calls getting frequently dropped. Majority of the time, you can not access 2G/3G .I conveyed the same to FK,and got some calls .Was asked to make factory reset and then try. Even after that, issue remained same. FK will message that they would reach you by so and so time as if they are punctual .But,everytime,you would get another message regarding extension of time. In fact, the issue will never be resolved. May be they are waiting for some scratch marks on the phone so that they can refuse the return. Summary :Don't buy electronics items from FK.It is good only for books and durable items, certainly not for electronic items where quality matters. In fact, I have drastically reduced my purchases from FK and moved to SD because of these issues.
0|1|Flipkart is fakecart company. I will never purchase anything from flipkart or suggest to my friend to go online with flipcart. I ordered Mi4i before 7 days and did payment cash on delivery. But After opening the box I found a phone like dummy, it's touch was not working I called to flipkart to return or replace but the rep are saying we don't have return replacement in your area(Noida 201301), The biggest joke is that you can deliver the product just because to take money from customer as I selected cash on delivery. And after taking the money you are not responsible to replace. They are asking me to courier that product to their office. If I would have to do this why why I shop online to save time rather than going to shop. I am totally disappointed from flipkart service and I am going to file a law suit against flipkart.
1|2|I have update my Mi4i Mobile but it is still heating up. Please solve this problem otherwise i will return
0|1|I have purchased MI4i and when i have started using then i realize that there is an heating issue in phone. So, i have requested flipkart to replacve /refund as it was under replacement/ refund period but denied to replace/ refund it and suggest me to go to service center. So, even when there is an replacement/refung guartanee then also Flipkart is not taking it back.. SIMPLY***** FLIPKART IS CHEATING THEIR CUSTOMER****** DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART.......
0|1|I never expected flipkart service to go so worse.. Had ordered a Mi4i phone and then requested for return aftr using it for few days as it had issues with the battery life. The representative called up and gave some tips to be followed to check the battery and asked us to create a return request again if the cell failed to work good on doing wat he said. And when i created a request again I am surprised that no one is calling back from flipkart and if I contact them they say that the representative has called me 3 times, when the fact is that I have not got call from there even once... Yesterday even after repeated attempts of calling flipkart customer care they never called me back regarding the problem and just kept giving me fake promises that they would be calling. I am really surprised that flipkart has dropped down to this level. Do you guys plan to play this game of false promise upto 30 days so that u can wash ur hands off staying that the 30 days replacement guarantee period g has expired. Don't you feel that the 30 days replacement guarantee policy makes no sense when u are cheating people by these cheap tricks. Disssapointed a lot. I am a flipkart first customer and always used to suggest people to buy from flipkart. May be I ll hav to stop shopping from flipkart and also suggest my friends the same after this experience. Worst experience ever FLIPKART!!!!!
0|5|Best product at this price in market . .......... ....
0|3|The phone is usable only after the MiUi update to take care of heating. Even with super careful usage and in soft case, the screen is developing scratches. So I doubt the phone has Gorilla glass as claimed. Disappointed here. I have been using motog since Feb 2014 and not a single scratch, even with no flip cover for almost 2 months, but mi4i is a bit too delicate. But LCD is crisp and sufficiently bright. There is a matrix of fine dots that u can see at certain angles in sunlight (no, not related to the unlock pattern) Some software bugs still, eats up too much memory and makes it unresponsive occasionally. After closing all apps and clearing using menu and x button, I see about 750 mb free ram, and I haven't downloaded any apps other than outlook client. In fact deleted the google bloatware. Hope xiomi does better in future phones.
0|1|worst mobile and bad service by flipkart, Never buy Xiaomi products due to following issue- 1. Heating issue 2. pathetic touch - back touch keys is most irritating 3. performance wise very poor- never felt like 2GB RAM processor performance 4. Very dull display under sunlight And above all bad service from Flipkart.
0|5|As first registration i could not get it but on my second registration i got chance to buy it and really it was superb experience and flipcart did faster delivery on it.
0|1|Worst customer service they provide when it comes to return the product... If you are selling you should have it back... if things dont function well....Facing lot of issue with it. Requested to return it but no one came back with solution. Every time they say that will call in 24 hours. Its been 2 weeks. Heating issue. applications are stuck......
0|1|So many issues: 1. Some times not able to connect wifi even after restart not getting connection. 2. having typing problem once u copy something u have to paste it everywhere. 3. flipkart is not replacing the product saying its 3rd party issue. 4. reliability of flipkart is getting worst these days 5. process is so slow 6. whatsapp msg popup is blinking 5 to 6 times My suggestion dont buy this phone if u get this problem flipkart will not replace ur phone
0|1|I got this set on 11-05-2015 and had problem on 11-06-2015, the set was not charging. Given at service center on 12-06-2015. Now as the 30 days return and exchange policy of Flipkart gets over so no exchange for new set.The service center people don't have tool to take out the sim out of handset.They used screw driver,all-pin, ladies hair pin etc. in front of me. Ridiculous. The battery of my set has to be charged twice in 24 hours else handset get discharged. Performance wise set is good.
0|1|At first i thought its just some settings problem but it have some front camera software defect front camera works like shit,problem in front camera some timne its works properly some time it works like shit some time it works clear and mopst time it works blured...so i climed for replacement lets see i get a proper piece this time
1|1|balotra pin 344022 not shipingi is filipkart mi 4i delawari is jodhpur 100 k,m balotra fedex 2-3 day arjant rishivd aitam
0|5|As a first impression the phone looks sleek, stylish and smart. Loved the way it works and definitely the Mi world. Screen, camera, speed are more than excepted. Proud for the purchase. Also want to give 5 Stars to Flipkart and happy that I made the purchase from them. I received my first delivery with broken screen, but the exchange policy and flipkart purchase protection helped me with a fresh brand new device delivered at doorstep and that too on fast delivery. Thanks flipkart.. you added one more happy customer in your list. :)
0|1|Just bought it couple of weeks back.. and suddenly proximity sensor stopped working. Not able to disconnect any incoming/outgoing calls as the screen just stays blank.. Flipkart return policy is really pathetic... They don't care for you after buying the product.. From the past 4 days waiting for there call for product replacement...
0|2|not satisfied mi 4i mobile
0|1|STORY AND MY JOURNEY AFTER USING ONE WEEK !!! 1.Bought the phone with high expectation but the speaker ,call drop issue and heating issue was persisting post update and doing all factory reseting the phone 2.Got the replacement product and it was having display issue as the display was getting black spot post charging. Cheap phone with lot of bugs better buy Zen-phone 2 which is good and doe-not have all the issue !! Heating issue is there post update it will go for zenphone 2
1|1|heating issues ...flipkart executive not doing the needfull they called once and then stopped answering
0|1|the phone heats up too much. Thankfully i got the replacement for the faulty device but imaging , the new phone was even worse. This is also heating up + the speaker is not working, It is permanently on silent mode. Have requested the Flipkart to refund my money.
0|3|mobile features are very good,till now i got a 5 updates in 1 month but the heating issue is not resolved in any update.
0|3|Hi, I got the phone couple of days back and is a good phone for 13K. However, I was plain surprised that that the phone doesn't support Device Encryption. Most of the corporates requires the device to be encrypted for the official mails to be delivered to your phone. It gives an option of encryption under the privacy settings and if you select it, it shows you that the device is getting encrypted but even after 6 hours the same screen is shown. If you press back the device goes to the previous menu. Device encryption is a key feature which is required in all phones but it is very disappointing that Mi4i doesn't have this basic feature.
0|1|THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. IT HAS SOFTWARE ISSUE. The phone I purchased does not boot, I am constantly getting the message "Unfortunately, System launcher has stopped" I can not get pass this massage. I can neither make a call nor receive the call. Flipkart offers no support, I have been told by Flipkart to go to service center, which will waste my whole day.
0|3|Problem with LCD Screen which was quite promenentlyvisible and Mother board (as stated by the service centre) .... Nice flipkart service...waiting for replacement product to arrive :)
0|1|i bought an mi4i smartphone and the screen went blank all by itself. i have been using the phone for just about 20 days. The phone has never been dropped or misused roughly. Also, the phone overheats quickly. too much problems with this smartphone. I have already emailed the flipkart customer care about the problems i am facing and wanting of replacement of the same. Awaiting their response in anticipation.
1|2|I got this Mi4i on another day i placed the order, I am facing internet connectivity issues on the phone, from the mobile data internet don't work, i have to mnaually on-off the mobile data. Gmail App is not working properlly , mobile running with Airtel-3G will not able to download the mail, once some one send it, mail will get downloaded when i restart the phone. I am looking for refund, lost trust
0|5|pros: >great performance >best camera >best battery >best look and nice finish >best display cons: >slight heating(after update 6.5.6) Every one is complaining that it's overheats if you what a phone without heating than you want to buy a nokia 1100 phone only.hey idiots it is a octacore processors .All octacore phones heats.Even iphone 6 with dualcore processor heats >no memorycard slots
0|1|I purchased this phone when there was a cash back of 10% on axis bank credit/debit cards. But I did not get the discount which i was supposed to get. When I contacted customer care they assured me to resolve this matter in 10 business days, after 10 days when refund was not done gain I contacted them. They said they will process it n next 8 business days. After 8 days also I did not get my refund. This is pure customer harassment they are doing by just making fake promises.
0|1|Because of the problems/issues I came across in the delivered product,I contacted flipkart.com for replacement under their 30day replacement policy but the request for return rejected twice by #flipkart.com without any solid base/reason. Problems: 1.heats upto 48 degrees centigrade in just 5 mins of voice calling and heats up beyond comfort level in just 10mins. I can't keep it in hands without making use of a napkin or cloth to remove sweat. 2.front camera gives too grainy images.so grainy that you can't even see the subject. 3.automatic brightness control doesn't work and prevent pocket dial feature doesnot work either. 4. Hangs too frequently may be because of the heating issue only. 5. As per flipkart(representative name-anwar),xiaomi says that temp upto 50 deg is NORMAL. If it goes beyond that then only a piece is eligible for replacement. 6. Flipkart also says that battery backup of 8-10 hours is absolutely fine for any smartphone and because I am getting battery backup of about 12 -14 hours on full charge in 2g network,I can't go for replacement. I trusted flipkart for the first time for buying a mobile phone from them and I swear,after this experience I WILL never buy any electronic good from them. I Received the phone on 6 June 2015 and placed my first request for return on 8 June 2015 and third request yesterday ie 11 Jun 2015.
0|1|EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED FROM FLIPKART! I purchased this phone some time back for my wife. Sorry to say but its a dysfunctional and bad product. Lacks the basic functionality - i.e. the sound of incoming ringtone is too low. Also the speaker is at the back side of the phone which further suppresses the sound of an incoming call. Bad design ! Not thought through ... Have been trying to return the phone but Flipkart's so called product experts are just too much. They fix a telephone call at their own whims and fancy and then call up before the scheduled time so that I miss the call and then these experts reschedule the appointment. After doing this 2-3 times, they cancel return request. This circus is going on for last 3-4 days. STAY away from buying this phone.
1|1|phone is good but hiting problam this price rance another phone is good.mobile future is not good.memory is not expandeble.selfie camera is averge. i am triyd retran policy bt flipkart not retrend my mobile.
1|1|Paid in advance for Mi 4i on 11 June. Eagerly awaited arrival of this phone. Packet was finally delivered on 13 June. Upon opening, I found packet empty. By the time, delivery boy had left. Complained over customer care. Not sure what will happen. I am hopeful Flipkart will either refund my money or supply the item.
0|1|I received MI4i in 3 days but with SIM Tray is missing; now i am waiting for response from Flipkart to resolve this issue. Prompt service, replacement was provided and within 3 day a new offer dropped price by Rs 1300/- There is no way of getting the benefit now. I now feel that flipkart has made fool of me.
1|1|Purchased on 1st june.camera quality pathetic especially seen on laptop. colors washed quality out. size of images less than redmi 1s . want to return but flipkart return policy frustating.approaching consumer court . think before you buy products from flipkart.
0|1|I have purchase this phone for my dad, first problem its speaker volume is too low, even my two year old Nokia 520 sound is higher than this phone. Can't complain as you can only see the features on site. Very Disappointed. Second problem phone heat up, after using for a while the phone gets heat up. Third problem screen crack, when i bought the phone their was no accessory available in the market nor on flipkart. its got crack after using only for one month, Cost me around 6300.00, and service center havn't received the screen yet, its on the way required one more week. I think in the age of One Day Delivery on most of the places, XIAOMI might be using Bullock cart courier services for spare part delivery. A wanted to give rating in Negative -10 for fooling customers for cheap phones, poor after sales service.
1|1|Phone Spec Is very good for the price offered. It works great. But... When we stick Tempered glass... Senors won't work And my mobile's screen had a crack all of a sudden without any physical damagefor which we do nit have warrenty. And I've bought a second phone for my wife whcih got heating issues... Upon Return & investigation by tech team... They have observed 43-4 degree centigrade temp... Which they say it as normal as its below 50. Flipkart is also in the deceiving list with its bluffing return policy.
0|1|my phone just not charging and went dead after month of use and it also has heating problem xiaomi i and flipkart i request you to either replace the pcs or refund my 13000.00 immediately without delay ,
0|3|Wifi connection suddenly drops automatically even when the signal strength is good, have checked on 2 different networks, problem still persists, in the status bar it still shows the icon (meaning its connected) when actually its not working, one has to turn off and turn it back on to gain the connectivity back.. is it a device issue.. has anyone else faced this issue... Can someone please help on this issue.
1|4|phone delivered within 24 hrs, which was great on delivery aspect, was very happy to have my hands on the phone.. but the happiness didn't lasted more than 5 minutes, the phone had crack on the screen.. apparently the delivery person cannot take back the phone immediately and advised to update flipkart so someone from pick up team will come and pickup the phone.. Quite strange, why they are wasting time and resources for sending another person for pickup, when they had one resource right in front of me.. Anyways Flipkart advised me the phone is not in stock for replacement and will issue refund.. waiting for pick-up schedule and refund.. Revising the comment.. so eventually flipkart got a replacement instead of refund.. the phone is great, no lags or problems observed so far with usage of ~ 2 weeks.. working as expected..
0|1|Worst experience i had ever with any shopping site. I bought mi4i with defect in front camera, requested for replacement, but flipkart policy doesnt support for this defect (as i heard from flipkart representative). With this defect who can use the product. really pissed off..... No way for me to replace this, I think flipkart lost their charm in the product quality and policy.
0|1|I buy phone for my Cousin. Phone is having problem it get restart / reboot every time you screen lock the phone. After 15 days of follow-up and time pass they said phone is having no problem by sitting in their office and now today they told me to visit service center. I don't understand how they said that you phone is not having any problem when there is one and by just checking over app. did you app is so smart that you can detect hardware problem also? You are just making people fool. I will never bye any thing now onward from you. i am thinking to file complain in consumer court. let see what happen.
1|5|external design was also good................................................................................
1|1|I purchased MI4i Mobile one month back problem with Ring Volume automatically decrease since one month observed and changed so many ringtones to test,whether it is with Ring Tone or with Mobile. finally i decided and conclude that problem is low quality Hardware. I decided that I never Buy these Low Quality Xiaomi Mobiles- Only they create artificial demand by using cheap business tact ticks My mobile [IMEI/Serial No: 866376021678609 Order ID-Order ID: OD002725197862154300
1|1|Enough is enough from Flipkart. I purchased mi 4i from Flipkart ON 10th of last month(ORDER ID: OD102785608948507200). Let me tell interesting sides of Flipkart, rather the duping sides of Flipkart . I raised the heating issue in my device to those Flipkart people and requested for return under 30 day return policy. I had upgraded my phone to latest OS by Xiaomi Global which had fixed the heating algorithm in my device. Now i placed a call as heating issue and hnging problems persisted, they wanted to resolve my issue on phone they requested me to install that smart check app on my mi 4i. They checked my device and requested me to delete extra applications. Even after reseting the phone and deleting apps the problem didn't fix. One interesting thing about Mi India is that it considers (48-50 degrees celsius) as heating problem those Flipkart executives told me this thing worth knowing.(i mean even 47 degrees can burn your hands) Again I made a call to Flipkart people and they scheduled a call for me. I told the customer care representative that I am out of the town wont be able to pick up the phone and my 30 days too will be over but she told me that till the time your issue isn't fixed your 30 day period will be continued. Now I again requested a call to those Flipkart people and to my surprise, the representative said 30 days replacement over.(feeling duped). Now tell me Mi India and flipkart what to do this was my first device from Xiaomi Global and plz resolve my issue asap...
0|1|PATHETHIC SERVICE - NO RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WOULD RATE IT ZERO STAR. I WAS DELIVERED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT & I RAISED MULTIPLE REQUESTS FOR RETURN, BUT NOBODY BOTHERED TO RESOLVE MY ISSUE. STUCK WITH A SUB STANDARD PRODUCT. CONTEMPLATING LEGAL ACTION/S. NEVER EXPECTED FROM FLIPKART.
1|1|I gifted this phone to my brother. After using it for 3-4 days he informed about the heating issues with the phone. I contacted FlipKart to take the phone back as I realised that most of the Mi 4i users are facing this problem. Thus no point of getting a replacement. I insisted on not refunding the money but putting it into my FlipKart wallet so that I can buy something else. After long conversations with support guys they denied that we do not have any such service to credit the amount in Wallet. At the max we can replace the handset that too after analyzing it, if there really is a heating issue and advised that upto 50 degree heat is common. With this, they closed my support ticket with comments ""Replacement (Return ID: ****689) - REJECTED, We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request. Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller. Hence, there will be no replacement or refund. Please refer to flipkart return policy"". After using Mi4i for a while, the stickers behind the phone started melting and shape of the stickers has changed due to high heat. I would advise not to go for this phone as I have already lost Rs 13828 (12999 + 300 Screen Gaurd + 529 Flip Cover). Please note I am using Mi3 from more than a year but Mi3 did not have such issues. One lost customer.
0|1|I purchased a mi4i and then i thought i would have bought a heating rod instead of that. However i have been trying to return the product / opt for a replacement but company representatives cancel return requests on one superficial reason or other stating it is has gone upto 42 Degree C not more than that . return will be given only after ears burns(48degrees) Customer care do talk about all the stupid policies.No resolution given. Stupid service ever seen. Rating less than .5
1|4|i given two time for return but till now their is no process.kindly do the needful for return my money asap.
0|1|The phone heats up very fast.Camera quality very bad.Internet not working properly.Need to restart every time to use internet.
0|1|ITS THIRD CLASS PRODUCT EVEN PHONE LIKE LAVA IRIS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS , FLIPKART IS CHEATING ITS CUSTOMERS BY SELLING THIS PRODUCT AND NOT ACCEPTING RETURN REQUEST AS 99% CUSTOMERS ARE MAKING RETURN REQUEST SO FLIPKART LITREALLY FORCING TO KEEP THIS CHEAP PRODUCT, BETTER FLIP KART STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT ITS DAMAGING THEIR CREDIBILITY
0|1|I purchase a mi4i and the power button some times works and some doesn't works. Heats up for the simple task like calling and whats app After gaming or web surfing it heat to extent that I can't hold it near my ear. The phone hangs a lot However i have been trying to return the product / opt for a replacement but company representatives canceled return request that I had not answered the call from them But they not at all called me Really Irritated
0|1|Please don't buy this phone.... It has serious overheating issue !!! & no return or replacement ...customer care is pathetic. I purchased the same from flipkart on 7th June and its upper screen & back is heating since day-one by only 5~10 min of talking. I called customer care for returning the product. Following is what they did: 1). First they gave me a No. (*#*#4636#*#*) to dial from the phone & check the battery temperature. If it is less then 45 degC then they said it is OK. 2). Secondly they asked me to reset the phone to factory setting. 3). Next they asked me install an application (Smartchk). They called me next day and checked the battery temp from this application again. They said since battery temp is fine they will not do any thing (return or replace) and told me take the phone to service Center !!!! Such an irresponsible answer i got ???
1|4|Delivery was quite fast and phone is working fine. As per specification I should get the handset but when I opened the box headset was missing. May I know the reason why I did not receive headset with the phone.
0|1|for one week i felt i got the best mobile in the world that too at this rate ! awesome display and cam blew my mind. but then comes the prob with my front cam full of colored particles. :/ terrible experience as I have never had issues with any mobile jus within a week. Flipkart has accepted to replace it. We'll see how it goes but feel very bad coz of this experience. And there is no option to refund as well ! That sucks. If the replacement is also going to be troublesome, I'm gonna fight for a refund!
0|1|I got a defective piece. Than complaint about it to customer care executive and got no positive response. Problem 1) Mobile is not charging properly i.e takes 2 hours to charge 50 %. 2) There are plenty of dead pixels on my mobile screen.
0|1|hi, i m anil from Agra, purchased amobile xiaomi mi 4i from flipkart, mobile has problem of hanging so i requested to Flipkart to replace this mobile. Flipkart accepted my request on second attempt for replacement but Flipkart is not giving the facility to pick the bad product itself thus i have to courier my mobile to Flipkart as a return on my own risk. when they received this courier, they will send replacement.
0|1|I bought this phone for my wife as an anniversary gift and opted for same day delivery, and the phone arrived after my anniversary which was after 2 days of the order. They spoiled my anniversary. The irony doesn't stop here also opted for gift wrap and message they had sent was half of which I have submitted. Never trust flipkart on delivery if you have any occasion :(
0|3|I got Mi4i mobile on 29 May 2015 found that charging through USB is not working , I have tried with others usb charger but the result is same however same usb charger is working for other phone , it seems there is some issue with phone.
0|1|Worst Experience buying Mi 4i. On second day after using Mi 4i its speaker stopped working, Lock unlock button does not work properly. Also, it doesn't look like a Rs.13000 phone. Request all desired people in buying this phone to change their decision.
0|5|Flipkart delivered it just the next day, 2 days before the promised date of delivery. The product packaging was flawless, too. Keep it up, Flipkart!
0|1|PHONE GETS HEATED UP REAL SOON. EVEN AFTER CLICKING ONE PHOTO IT HEATS UP, WHILE CALLING IT GETS HEATED UP. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TAKE THE PHONE TO EARS WHILE CALLING DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE HEAT. REAR CAMERA QUALITY NOT GOOD. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 13 MEGAPIXEL. FLASH IS A WASTE FOR LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY. EXPECTING TO GET MY HARD EARNED MONEY BACK BY RETURNING THE PHONE. HOPE FLIPKART WILL DO THE NEEDFUL. WANT TO GET RID OF THIS PHONE.
0|1|This phone is going to tarnish the image of flipkart. This is a crap piece of shit from china. It was my mistake that I bought this phone. Seriously, heating up, not able to sync contacts, bringin some junk while syncing and not contacts, you cannot configure you enterprise emails and the phone cannot take more than 4 digits for security pin whereas enterprise emails need atleast 8 digits, screen doesnt looks like full HD even after full brightness, my htc 816 is much clear and bright. no external sdcrd can be inserted, the inbuilt 16gb is just a myth, when I first booted the, I had only 10.47 GB available out of 12. something usable storage out of 16GB, And also flipkart didnot disclose/ tell you in its spec list that you cannot add additional external sd card, it is when you look for revivews and other websites for full feature list. now you can think how much storage is available for your use. Also at first boot itself, the RAM was almost 1.2 GB utilized out of 2 GB without any application installed, so how much will be available for you in future. Plastics and body looks so cheap...not an 13K phone. When I tried to return the pieice, flipkart started blah blah and told me that they will call to understand the issue, but I didn't recieve any calls from them but the messages that they tried to call me but Iwas not reacheable and then finally they closed my return request. Shame of flipkart....seriously I will never come again on flipkart to buy anything. They are cheaters selling bullshit online.....
1|1|i got this mobile 10 days before.The design is amazing but i do have some issues with the set. My mobile is getting hang and heating is too much, I contacted flipkart for a replacement but now they are telling me to go to service center... Means that flipkart is mentioning wrong policy on its website about repalcement.
1|1|Flipkart company also no response was this product.............................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|Speaker is not working properly.Lot of noise with very less sound.Please do not buy the product if the problem still exist.Even flipkart should not sell such products if they have so many bad reviews about the product.
0|1|I am facing heat, while in a call for longer time its hurting my ear. Flipkart folks called and asked to download some stupid APP they sent via mail. I have checked the temperature with APP and its 40 Degree C. Please stay away from this phone and Flipkart, as they are not replacing this defective product. Very much disappointed.
0|1|heat and restart issues, Flipkart not replace the product, I did 30 day before. and white color not looks good
1|1|We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request. Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller. Hence, there will be no replacement or refund. Please refer to flipkart return policy I got this above from Flipkart. Cheaters. Don't buy any phone from Flipkart.
1|1|I received my product on 27th May, But After 2 days of using the product i feel there are few issues in the front speaker. Immediately i called Flipkart and Explained the issue. They promised me that I will receive a call by July 2nd . but no call from technical team on July2nd, Again i explained the entire story to Flipkart executive, They promissed me that i will recive a call by July 3rd,, again no response from Flipkart. Now again they are asking two days time. Now a days there is no proper response from Flipkart...
0|1|I requested for replace of the phone due to excess heating of my phone. They said they will do it but still after one week or so they have not triggered return. Excess heat. Do not buy this.
0|1|Its making foolish... no product delivered & order is cancelled by flipkart without my confirmation or consent.
0|1|Got the phone on 18th may'15. Daily getting problem of batteryas it was not getting charged after 3-4 hours of charging.Also the phone was heting up considerably. Request to return the phone was rejected saying that your system needs to be reinstalled.Same problemm is being faced till date.
0|3|hi guys, Below is my experience after buying MI4I > Flipkart Delivery :Next After order Placement - ***** as usual > Display : Excellent but if you suffer from light phobia don't buy this phone - *** > Performance : Not up to the mark Hugo barra exaggerated it during launch.*** > Touch Response : Excellent***** > 4G connectivity : SIM CARD SLOT1 supports 4G & SIM CARD SLOT 2 not supports. but xiaomi claims both slots support 4G. ** > Gaming : I'm not a Gamer >Camera : Excellent & compete with Iphone 6 ***** > Recording : Call recording Facility is excellent & it is very useful for the business people to record their calls*as a proof**** >Battery : Under normal usage i.e If you start your day at 7 am with 100% charge with 4G & activities like facebook browsing,whatsapping ,video downoading from whatsapp ,taking some photos & 1 hour calls both local and STD- at the end of the day you will left with 15% charge at 6PM.***** Major issue is rapid heating of phone while in 4G & during some long calls so people live in hot cities are not advised to buy this phone.I'm in Bangalore & for my city weather im comfortable with the heat because it work also as a palm warmer.
1|5|Pl dont buy the crap chinese phones....i bought it on 25th may & got delivered on 28th may. The Sim1 slot is not working...i did hard reset...updated phone with 800 mb available update ...restarted plenty of times... but nothing worked for me. The most disgusting behavior shown by flipkart. They directly REJECTED my Replacement request twice without talking me. They told that """Replacement (Return ID: 20439940) - REJECTED We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request""" """Replacement (Return ID: 20663414) - REJECTED We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request. Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller. Hence, there will be no replacement or refund. Please refer to flipkart return policy""" Now u people can easily understand that how flipkart cheating their loyal customers Pl dont buy from filpkart
1|1|The camera is not up to the mark. When asking for replacement customer representative talked that only wrong shipment can be replaced. Later word he agreed for camera quality check with technical support team. Hope I will get the replacement.
0|1|donot waste your 12999/- rupees on this cheap phone, overheating, browsers do not work, play store do not work, cant able to hold mob near ears its like burning, moreover flipkart do not have any answer to any query raised or to resolve issues , customer care is saying that i must use branded charger like samsung or micromax for charging mi4i (means this is not good brand a they have also accepted), never expected from company like flipkart.....NO REFUND NO EXCHANGE FROM OTHER GOOD BRAND, highly disappointed from customer care and this Chinese toy.......negative marking
0|2|Phone is very good. But the Service centers are Pathetic. My phone broke accidentally and I had given for the display replacement 3 weeks back. Till date service center has no clue what to do and they keep saying parts no available and they are saying they are not getting any response on their calls itself from MI. Registered complaint on MI call center, they will check the status and get back after 3 days . What kind of support is this ?
0|1|- Battery backup 5 hours only - Abnormal heating issue - Customer service not good - Customer service can't accept for refund.
0|1|i bought mi4i phone on may24.. there was a black dot on the screen... so i asked for replacement .... flipkart people called next day and they disconnected the call and they did the same for many days ..... they irritated me like anything ... so plzzz dont buy anything through flipkart ...
0|1|Front Camera is getting blurred & its unable to click pics. how can mobile face such a grave issue within 1 month...Chinese mobiles are Chinese afta all. i have requested for return, so that I can receive new phone but even flipkart is not bother on this issue..& its pending like for forever it seems...zero stars for flipkart on this
0|1|phone low battery.over heating.net work problem.call not connect.data only buffing application restart ringtone is very low.
0|1|I ordered Mi4i from Flipkart but I faced issue with display ie. lock Screen freezes out along with it no number and Name is being displayed on the screen. Display freezes until cal gets disconnected. When contacted Flipkart for returning the order they are saying it can only be replaced not returned and that too after verification that the customer saying is fact. I would give this phone as --5 in rating. Hope flipkart understands my problem and get the piece returned or get me new piece with zero errors.
1|1|Flipkart send me a defected product. I replaced it and they again send me same defected product. It is ogs defected. White led lights leak from the bottom of back key and home key.It is very noisy effect. So guys don't buy this kind of defected mi4i. Don't pay 13k for this defected mi4i I make return 2nd time and flipkart rejected my request but why. Very disappointed by flipkart. In future I will never buy any products from flipkart. update-- flipkart accepted my replacement and promise me to give a defect free mi4i. waiting for phone. phone received, but problem not solved.
1|1|Hi Folks, I really don't like the user interface of this mobile, icons are very small and different. It may also possible that i didn't accept the user interface of this device after using standard kitkat. Continuous uses (Min.10 Minutes) will lead to heating problem. Device plastic looks cheap. I will not recommend this phone to anyone. I didnt' try music hope this will create frustration to me. Mi has just playing marketing gimmicks by creating registration process, as we all know if we create scarcity of anything the people will love to achieve with the cost of hard earned penny. Thanks, Amit Tiwari
0|3|=======WORST==========Phone Please dont buy this phone it is heating like anything. I had changed from nexus to mi4i according to the configuration playing mortal combat X the phone heats up like anything. Heating problem when the phone is kept on charging also. Please donot purchase. This review is 3 days for the date of received. Screen is crystal clear camera is good not awesome. Total space is only 10.00 gb not 12 gb as for user usage. Battery seems to be normal as compare to my nexus 1750MAH. With no usage of games and browsing 50% is almost gone. I am not satisfied with the performance of this phone as compare to yureca. Price is high. So please compare the phone before you purchase in money wise. I would not recommed anyone to purchase this phone... Dont see that the phone is out of stock.. it doesnt mean that it has a high value in the market...this are all marketing tricks.. Last but not the least..while charging phone is getting warm and not fast charging is done.. so PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE U PURCHASE.
1|1|I purchased a Mi 4i on 7-5-2015 and got the delivery on 14th of may.But from the very next day I got the delivery of this product,whenever I open the google drive,it shows "Sorry!The application google drive has stopped unexpectedly.please report this error to help us improve our product.
1|1|Dear Flipkart, My Mi4i is having following severe issues: 1.My front camera is giving very noisy pictures.Whole screen is full of colourful dots and images are totally black. 2.Phone heats a lot even when small applications are used like watsapp,small games and some times heat is unbearable to hands. 3.Phone is lagging a lot in its processor speed.When I type something on keypad,it appears on screen after some delay. 4.Screen Blackouts sometime when back button is pressed while closing applications. Kindly help me out from above issues.I had lots of hope from Mi but it fails. I dont want this phone and brand anymore as I felt cheated. I request you to refund me back and I will go for ASUS Zenfone 2 ZE551ML by adding some extra money.
1|1|I am a frequent buyer of this flipkart. Before some day I bought mi4i..after using it I found the heating and hanging problem. This mobile can't handle subways surfer under smoothly..please don't buy this.... And a big shot to flipkart return service .
1|1|I purchased mi4i from flipkart vide order No.302948215530728100, phone delivered very fast but sorry to say with deep regret that it could not ever start, only Mi logo and mi.com is displayed, the phone is not turning off after long pressing the start button. I requested refund but today flipkart has agreed to replace the phone by 8th june 2015, lets see but Iam very much disappointed as I had to gift the phone to my son on his 23rd birthday
0|2|Don't buy this cell, it has severe hanging problem, call drop problems. sometimes also not taking charge, one's need to reboot. Complete headache..........
1|1|I bought this phone which got delivered on 30-May-2015. However, the device looks faulty, as it shuts down after every 30-40 seconds on inactivity. Have requested Flipkart to replace the product with a workable piece
0|1|Order ID Phone white Mi 4i : OD202905255718275600 I won,t recommend this phone at all and also Flipkart is n more consumer centric company and they stopped refunds for electronics Even though it is defective ???? I bought this phone on the launch date 21st May during the flash sale and found that battery is not charging and speaker is not working .When plugged into wall socket with Mi 4i original charger battery charges from 10% to 40% to 45 % and then it starts decreasing even though the charger is plugged inn in wall.I tried to plug it into different wall socket but same story . The speaker of phone is not audible in spite of the fact that all volumes are full I have been breaking my head to get the full refund since last 3 days but flipkart is not agreeing for the same and is insisting for the repair of the phone which is really pathetic.My 12,999 are gone into drain !!!
0|1|AS OTHERS SAY, THE DEVICE IS GREAT. BUT... I GOT MY MI4I 3 DAYS AGO AND SINCE I SWITCHED IT ON, I SEE A STRANGE SPOT ON THE LOWER BOTTOM PART OF THE SCREEN. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE DEAD PIXELS. SO I HAD TO CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO EXCHANGE THE PRODUCT (OBVIOUSLY). THEY SAID TO RUN FEW APPS (DEAD PIXEL REMOVER OR SO). I TRIED ALMOST EVERYTHING AND REPORTED BACK. THEY AGAIN SAID ME TO RUN THEIR 'SPECIAL' APP TO CONNECT TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE YESTERDAY. I HAVE GOT NO REPLY YET.
1|2|I am not happy with the product and services, the phone is getting hang from very first day. I have not downloaded multiple apps or anything still its not working and hanged frequently. I have already requested for return but haven't heard back anything from them except the email that I need to upload an app so that the engineer can track the problem, when the phone is not at all working, how can I download another app and keep it with me. I am unable to make any call. Not happy at all. In addition to this, it has major heating problem,
0|4|I have been using this phone for a while now... more precisely 3 weeks now. I was able to grab it on its first sale but didn't buy then.. I wasn't sure of quality. I have used HTC HD2(adorable phone... I lost it), HTC Sensation XE, iPhone 5C before but never felt so comfortable from day one. I was about to buy another expensive brand phone when my wife who is very practical suggested me to try this one. I am glad I did. Here is my detailed feedback... this is completely my feedback, individual choice and preference can differ.. Weight - its so light ..only 130gm.. I have been using phones weighing around 170 gms before.. I was so surprised to notice no weight in the pocket. With its polycarbonate uni body it looks premium and at the same time it light. Screen - ahh.... just so nice. I can't point specifics but there is something that pleases so much. The screen is very good, it’s not a QHD display, but for a 1080p display, its darn good, you can't make difference. Performance - This is a beast... I didn't felt any lag at all which playing heavy games like Asphalt, temple run etc Battery - Lasts a day and half with medium usage and switching data/wifi off at midnight till 8 in the morning. Volume and Power controls are comfortably placed. Only issue that I noticed was heating issue. it gets little heated while charging or playing games but that is problem with HTC phones as well. Mi4i has a tad more than others but that I can compromise on and not a dampener for me. So over all excellent phone. ****GO FOR IT*** ****Don't you ever buy 'flipkart first' subscription, that is is a cheat. They never do what they promise. Products on which you expect same day delivery or next day delivery you will never get which they promise to give you while buying it. When you'll actually ask for it, they will ask you to read their terms and condition which is 10 pages long. **** Please you never buy 'flipkart first' subscription*** I am giving a rating of 4 because it is sold on flipkart.
0|2|Order on 1st Flash Sale, received after 15 days after so many followups, product warranty start on invoice not by delivery date ( lost 13 days of warranty ). No satisfactory answer from customer care about delayed delivery & shortened warranty period. No policy to return the product any of the way even in the case of launching of the new product which we are not sure how it is going to perform. once the product delivered it cannot be taken back by flipkart. I give the Product rating 7 out of 10. but for flipkart it is 2 out of 10. This time overall experience was bad & policy was vendor oriented.
0|2|Its internet connectivity is too poor. Pls solve this issue or take back this item. i really disappointed to its poor connectivity issue.
0|1|Giving it 1 star as can't give rating in negative. Phone is like almost heater for me, after 5-10 minutes of call, it used to get heat up by 46-50 degree and you can not even keep the phone over ear for you call. (Better use headset for call). After so many hurdle in return process, got approval to get replacement for first phone and finally got MI4i again. And really the next one was successor of previous phone for heating. It heated upto 55 degree of temperature. Thanks for Flipkart, this time they didn't give that much of trouble in return process. Finally got refund accepted for my Compact heater and got my money back in my account.
0|1|i have purchased this phone just before 20 days and in 20 days i have lots of bad experiance charger is not working in proper and also touch is very bad and its always hange and flipkart is telling me that they will change my phone 2 days and its going on with 10 days i tired with this phone i have never use bad phone like this in my life i will give 0 star for this products
0|1|Never thought I would say this but Flipkart has given me terrible service this time. My screen has a kind of smudge but it is clearly not a case of dead pixels, its a hardware flaw. They have been telling me to download app for troubleshoot and do a hardreset as if that could solve a hardware problem. The phone also heats up. The sound is toooo low. And it takes forever to charge the battery.
0|1|I HAVE VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART , I BOUGHT A MI 4I MOBILE ON HIS FIRST SELL, I WAS COMPLAINED TO FLIPKART THAT THIS MOBILE HAVING OVER HEAT ISSUE AND I WANT TO CASH BACK, BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NO POLICY FOR CASE BACK AND THEY GIVE ME A NEW PHONE, BUT NEW PHONE ALSO HAVE SAME ISSUE. WHEN I COMPLAINANT FOR SAME THE DON,T HELP AND SAYS WE CALL YOU, BUT DON,T CALL ME
1|1|I have unnecessarily wasted my 13000, regrating so much, apps not working cameras are not working, playstore is not opening, apps like paytm even flipkart apps is not not working i m using my friends phone to write this reviews. dont buy it you will be regrated for sure. heating problem. hanging all the time...etc..
1|1|I purchased it from flipkart. i had lots of expectation with this mobile as this offers more features than any other mobile in this range. Camera is awesome but internet does not work. It display 3G network but internet does not work. any application which require internet does not work. Playstore, chrome, browser does not work. only whatsapp works, nothing else. Flipkart having good reputation in market should not sale or promote this kind of product which can harm his reputation. I have applied for solution with customer care and they told me that i will get call from technical team but did not get any call yet. Hope flipkart will resolve my issue soon as possible as i am regular user of the company. I don't want refund but i want replacement with good handset.
1|1|I am buying products from flipkart for quite some times now. This is the first time I bumped into a product that have some issue. Firstly flipkart delivered the product well before time and packaging was also in good condition. But when we start up the mobile we noticed back button is not working. I called flipkart customer care and they asked me to install an app in the phone and a technical person will call me within 31st May. Still waiting for the call. I am not very sure whether an app can detect the problem that we are facing. Anyways hoping for the best. Will update the review once I get my replacement and this time I hope that I will not be disappointed.
1|4|Recently i purchased the mi4i and seller confirmed the product on the same day. The product should dispatch on next day(or day after tomorrow if delay),which is lacking i am tracking online it is showing same status"seller confirmed your product" till 4th day. When i call flipkart customer care on 4th day,the product is dispatched by End of 4thday same updated in the status and status keep changes on 4th till the product is reached near to my shipment area. If this happen before i complain customer service that will be really good. Again i face same problem,the product is not out for delivery till again i call flipkart customer care. Once my call completed i received message to mobile saying the product is out for delivery and will be reached EOD. Apart from delivery i am satisfied,The product looks awesome and good. Install updates before start using it. Feels like little bit heating if used in crowd area's...i mean while traveling,on streets it may be because of hot summer :) We can trust product will be delivered as ekart is part of flipkart service like other fake product or no product received. I am giving 4 rating..,i really want to give 5 but flipkart tested my patience by delay in delivery. :)
1|2|I bought mi4i on 7th may after taking in hand its Awesome BUT something is wrong Light is Leakage from below back button that is not acceptable from Xiaomi however get replaced second one but on second handset has same ISSUE , I am very disappoint From Xiaomi . Again I request to change handset from flipkart they told me they will contact me but there is no reply ..................till now!
0|2|heats like anything, speaker is literally dead one, cdn't evn hear if m away one step ahead from the phone. i have raised a complaint for return but the seller has rejected by giving crap reason..
0|1|Total waste of money battery and software problem flipkart showing his true identity vv poor customer care
0|1|I purchased this phone 5 days before still i not use this mobile due to battery problem mobile not even on....i requested flipkart 4 days before still now they saying cal will come from concern person...for last three days bullshit product..i purchased more then 25 product from flipkart in this product i seened real face of flip kart.
0|5|Been using it for around two weeks now, its doing whatever its supposed to do. No lag. Great specs. If you like a thin phone- this is it! If you like a really light phone - this is it! If you want a great display- this is it ! Yes, it DID heat up a lot. But not anymore thanks to the new updates rolled out by Xiaomi. And you live in India. Don't expect your phone to be 30 degrees when your environment is at 40 :P. The only problem which persists is the fast battery drain, but it does last 15+ hours with casual usage(whatsapp, browser, fb) About MIUI, it's totally up to your tastes. I find it really simple and fast. Go for it if you are under a budget, you wont be regretting it :)
0|2|I purchased a Mi 4i and it has charging issues. It's taking a lot of time to charge.The phone is supposed to charge from 20% to 100% in 2 hours, it took me 4 hours to charge from 20% to 75% .However i have been trying to return the product / opt for a replacement but company representatives cancel my return requests Disappointed
1|1|My MI4I mobile is having only 780MB, I cant install any apps. When i request for return in Flipkart, their technical team is keep on dragging by telling unnecessary thnings, Flipkart service is very bad in return policy. Better to not to buy any products in Flipkart especially electronic goods.
0|1|I hv ordrered the product.It has battery problem.It get heated quickly. I dont get any revert neither from WS retail nor from Flipkart.It doesn't comes with memory card slot. Aleast reply to our reviews...I have requested for Return 5 days ago,but still don't get any reply..
0|1|Worst phone i have ever used. and flipkart service is wrost. After 28 days use I experienced very bad service from Flipkart, after 20-30 calls even they have not arranged technical support for me. Every time they told that 'you will receive a call from our technical team after 24 hrs.' But after 21 days even i could not received call from technical team. now flipkart executive telling your guarantee period will be over after 6 days. Just worst and irritating......
0|1|Speaker sound is very low, loud speaker is very low. If keep talking for 10 to 15mins then it will burn the ear. ActiveSync PIN will not accept more then 4 digit pin, but it will prompt for 6 digit. Flipkart customer care is very rude and they want to troubleshoot and repair new phone.
0|1|very poor quality mobile dont expect much with this phone is strucking while working moreover there is no external memory pls dont choose this flipkart people also not responding once you order gone that money wil not come again.
1|2|There was some connectivity issue (Net connectivity) with my mobile - MI4I. Really confused whether the issue was with my mobile or network service provider as my connectivity is not on home network (Roaming). When asked for replacement, flipkart advised me to courier the product at their Bangalore address (From Guwahati) - Cost of which is around Rs. 3800 which will be refunded to me on my flipkart account (Not bank account). Thus, flipkart block their customers and leave them with no other option and my total cost goes around Rs. 17000 and I would have got Nexus 5 by spending some more amount. @ Flipkart - If you can't provide the replacement in Guwahati, why do you sell the products in Guwahati????Really bad experience..Will never ever prefer to purchase from flipkart..
0|1|Since, the time I have purchased this product, I am struggling just to make it run, Google play store is not working nor are other preinstalled applications. I was told by XIOMI Customer service to download an upgrade of 805 MB and after that everything would be fine. Even after doing that nothing is working. Finally, Xiomi guys tell me to return the phone to Flipkart and take replacement. and now I am struggling to get the replacement. Flipkart, instead of calling on my Registered mobile number is calling on the number given at the time of ordering which happens to be the number of the person I have gifted, Trying to explain to customer care, they are not understanding. First time I am having such a bad overall experience.
1|1|Bakwass mobile battery problem, brightness nhi hai, third class touch, hang kerta hai............................. ............................... No guarantee
0|5|I was purchase MI 4I phone from flipkart but in my phone box EARPHONE IS NOT GIVEN SO PLEASE SEND MY "EAR PHONE". phone so nice its working smoothly. phone is so nice
1|1|It turns out that the internal memory is only 1 gb instead of 16 gb. It has no google store installed and the miui interface is not updated. I have contacted mi team and they have agreed that phone has to be replaced by flipkart. Flipkart team is yet to contact me. Please check all the specifications once you unpack the box.
0|1|don't buy from this seller and this product useless seller buying any product from this seller means wasting you time .
0|1|most defected mobile i have seen in my life.. defected camera...black spots when u try to click pictures. u cant store ur clicked picture...gallery is always empty. u cant see call log...u can never find if u got a missed call or received any call or dialed any for that matter. gets heated up like anything with in 20 mints of use. when i tried to call to return..the so called technical team calls and asks to download a stupid app that will not work then they asked to update the system of how many GBs i dnt know. frustrated...
0|1|Flipkart once agains Chooses to fool its customers..Firstly this phone looks pathetic. secondly when i went on returning the product fk straigthaway declined my request stating that the product cannot be returned neither the amount can be refunded...So Now All i am left with is a toyphone and a 13k loss to my pocket. DONOT BUY A PHONE FROM FK..they fool us while returning the product in case you dont like it.
0|3|Hello, I have not received head phone set along with my order also SIM card ejecting Pin Regards, Kiran Jagadale
0|1|I have numerous problems and have logged a return request. They keep closing my return request without speaking to me. Basically, this is blatant cheating ...im now with a product which doesnt work on multiple counts and no one cares to address my concern/s Any ticket i raise is quickly closed without me being contacts..SHAME ON YOU FLIPKART!!!
1|1|When connected to Internet or playing games. Phone is getting hot in such a way one cant use it. I am not sure this may leads to radiation and affect ears and brain. Flipkart is not ready to replace this phone with another brand. They want to dump chinese low cost mobile on india. 13,000- total waste. Very casual responses from Flipkart. This is my second MI phone. First worst phone is Redmi 1s Better to buy some branded mobiles Karthik
0|1|Very poor response from Flipkart. I am very disappointed with the product and service. Given 4 times complaint with in 10 days but no response and they even don't send the complaint number so as there is no proof at your end and neither they send you any report which shows the height of negligence from such a big brand. I strongly recommend others not to buy products from Flipkart and better to pay additional 15-20% and get it from shop. My complaint was that phone was getting heated up and started hanging from day one. They had done some study on the phone and told that its getting heated maximum upto 40 Deg C and which is normal. I told to give the supporting documents but no feedback there after and denied the replacement of the handset. While giving advertisement they hide the information from customer and try to sell the maximum volume of products and later deny to change the products.
0|1|DONOT BUY WORST SERVICE BY FLIPKART IN PREPAID ORDER AND NOT ENTERTAINING FROM LAST 15 DAYS RPU NOT DOING FOR REFUND BEING MENTALLY HARRAS
0|4|I will give 4 star for prouct. Its best in class, category & price. But... Delivery by flipkart is very worst experinece. I booked on 07 May, est Delv was 14 May & recd on 19 May. On after 14 may. I followed up with Flipkart daily & they dont have shipment details, where it is lying? Delhivery Courier also not able to track & delayed in delivery. It took 06 days to reach product from Andheri hub to Kalyan hub from 10 may to 16 may. Its horrible.
0|4|Perfect device, with Decent camera and performance. Missing Memory card slot For some reason still this device can not be rooted, no rooting mechanishm found yet
0|1|I bought the product after reading good reviews about it but I am really disappointed after using if for 2 days. Cons: -- Get heated even while charging. When i open a simple app the CPU temp goes upto 65 degrees (this is after the 800MB update) -- Hangs if you run an app for 10 mins -- very low ringtone voice. -- very low speaker volume. When I tried to return it on Flipkart, there is no such option there. There is only replace option that too is subject to Flipkart terms and conditions. I have been trying to contact Flipkart customer care to replace it but there is no response from them. Really regret buying this phone and that too from Flipkart.
0|1|Usually Chinese products used to have defects. Apps are malfunctioning. Flipkart's team tries to keep with me the device by several delaying response. Also cancelled returns several times. I think, Amazon is the only best shopping site. They must issue replacement. Worst
0|1|I had issues with my front cam and raised a return request. when my front cam is on continuously for 20-25 seconds, the focus goes blurred and full of grains. We had a trouble-shooting session yesterday with your "SMARTCHK" app. The APP DID NOT have an option of having the camera on for more than 5 seconds even. Hence The representative could not proceed further with your APP thus asked me to visit the MI service center to confirm if the issue is with the Hardware, If the issue is still found, i would need to raise a new request which is possible only when we close this current request. Hence I agreed to close the request, but needed the representative to mention every observation mentioned above, and the exact reason of closing the request in the mail. But in the mail, I had the following, "We have looked into and solved your concern as per our discussion and accordingly closed your return request. " How can you just close it as solved and no details are being mentioned in the mail regarding our observations in the troubleshooting session. THE APP HAS LIMITATIONS and hence was not able to troubleshoot further. The person told she would mention everything before closing the issue. And has mentioned NOTHING. While the issue is still there how can you close it saying it s resolved?? This is literally cheating the customers.
1|4|its too good product in this price but it having some heating problem, i have solved heating problem by updating to "MIUI-6".... one disappoint thing is it won't given "Headphone" so we have to purchase it privately .....!! anyway its worth full product..!! :)
0|1|Very Very irresponsible attitude of customer care helpline . my phone mi4i is defected i was trying to replace it till the date of delivery. but they still hang me ...they said that my tecnician will call you next day and message came to me . but when time is near to come exactly they given next message that the next day we call you in that time .... as on as on this happened from the date of delivery and now today. i am getting very frustrated i not able to think what to so about my serious issue . ....if this issue is not resolved with in next days then i will going to take legal action about the flipkart ... ( i am trying to contact on 22-may-2015 ), they daily confused me now 26- may-2015...very very worst service from flipkart i requested to all consumer of flipkart please don't buy any item for this site ......
0|3|I Received Mobile on 24th May 2015 while i placeing for Mobile charging it was hanged at 40% it won't charge mobile fully it stops charging
0|1|i bought MI4I on 25-04 2015 , actual internal storage is 16gb but its showing only 110MB available space out of total 780MB. I never expect this from flipkart n xiaomi.
0|1|Touch pad is not working at right side corner of the screen. Totally disappointed with delivery of defected product.
0|1|Heats too much from the day one Phone got replaced within 2 days still the problem persists inspite of update Issued raised with flipkart & support from them absolutely poor even customer care team is very harsh I have asked for the refund, initially they have accepted to refund provided they would a SMARTCHECK, during the test temp was very high & they claim it is normal They also claims the test conducted was passed without submitting any reports and its completed onesided response from Flipkart Understood from Flipkart wants to run-away from the situation & without resolving the issue they closed ticket too
1|1|Very POOR Flipkart Return Policy I purchase a mi4i,Issues are 1) Heating if you uses continuous. 2) The sound is less(sometimes) However i have been trying to return the product / opt for a replacement but company representatives cancelled the return requests two times.I dint like this phone and day by day FLIKART service is pathetic.
0|1|its got over heated when idle and while calling its getting heat. Very poor quality and sound quality is also very poor and not able to hear ringer. There is network issue, webpages is not loading, every time loading error coming. Spoke to flipcart people , and after a call with them , they say nothing , just put this code *#*#4636#*#* and check your battery like howmuch degree it shows but when i place it near by air condioinger it shows 34 degree, as soon as if i get a call, it shows 42 immediately, still the flipcart guys can not help and you can not exchange or money back on the mobile. just waste of money,but the camera was good.
0|1|Bought the Mi 4i phone in flash sale based on Flipkart trust. This phone is not available in market to try out. This phone has serious design problem. It gets extremely hot that you can't hold it near the ear. This is during normal usage (not even gaming). Flipkart is not taking the returns. Flipkar should be dragged to court for selling such phones and cheating customers. Hugo Bara should also be dragged to court for calling this as India flag ship phone. I am giving 0 stars and
0|1|It seems I have received a refurbished phone. The phone heats up badly when 3G is used and while charging as well. Although the configuration is quite well, but what I fail to understand is that why it hang/stuck every now and then. The heat is unbearable while you are on a call and using internet on the phone. I am thinking of returning this phone. Disappointed customer !!
1|2|I purchased the product before 3 weeks.When I got the product I didn't comfortable with with its packages and seal. So I place a return request before 2 weeks and they agree me to give refund for the specific product. But till yet now I didn't get my refund. I contacted to them many times but I didn't get a reply that when I get my refund. Very disappointed by Flipkart customer care.
1|1|I have purchased Mi4i and the speakers do not work. One more review I found who reported the same http://www.flipkart.com/reviews/RVBB1HK5SBYNOPXZF. I have asked for relacement but I keep getting auto generated calls from flipkart and they say our representative will contact you and my phone rings and gets disconnected and they keep postponing the call to the next day. I never get to speak to the real person who will resolve my query. When I call back on toll free number they schedule another appointment. The phone is horrible. Camera is very poor. I do not think Mi4i is delivering what they promised.
1|2|plus point- attractive look, very keen display,excellent touch. negative point------------everything else. Phone is too slow. Getting slow bit by bit, as they promised look is very nice nothing else. they are still using plastic body even having heating issue their phone, making them gambling with us. i know everyone want a proof and i m providing it wisely. you just install office suit 8 and check performance. it sucks. 1gb kitkat is about 158 times better than this mi4i. do not waste your money on such shit.
0|1|This is my worst phone I have ever had. A lot of problems in this phone:- A lot of heat is generated when charging and even when surffing internet.....!!!!! Sound quality is poor......!!!! Restricted memory you have.....!!!! When i applied for replacement to flipkart they rejected within 2 days.....!!!! only display of this phone is good....!!!
0|1|Mi4i handset was delivered to my address on 24th May, since I was out of station, on return I tried to start using the same. I observed the following problems and immediately reported the same to FLIPKART. 1) On switching on, found that the set is too much hot, during charging it's even difficult to hold. 2) During initial setup I used English UK as language and India as country but after configuration I find everything in Chinese language. Can't use the set at all. 3) In the name of user manual I find only a chit with hardly few words. Isn't it cheating? 4) It was nowhere mentioned that battery is non removable Taken up the matter with Xiaomi Customer Care, Mr Kapil (Customer executive) tried all possibilities for resetting the language through me, but problem was not resolved. I have launched online return request, I request all online buyers to be vigilant about the service provided by FLIPKART. Flip kart is having their own courier Ekart for delivery, I have purchased this phone on COD, during delivery my wife wanted to open the box and see what is there inside before making payment. But courier fellow told that make payment first, if any problem is there we will collect back the product from your house and a new product will be given. On return request FLIPKART says return at your own cost. Why? It's service deficiency on FLipkart side.
0|1|Have got this on 23rd of May. After two days of usage i feel very bad with this product. It is getting overheated even without charging. simply while texting, attending phone calls. The data connectivity also has issues. when i enable data service it is there for 2-3 mins and then getting disconnected automatically. Need to reboot the phone to regain the connectivity. Seems an OTA is available to solve the overheating. Not sure how it works. But still data connectivity will be an issue. so requested for replacement.
0|1|Buyers beware about the issues that I have faced .The screen is extremly flimsy it cracked in my pocket .Service is extremly poor I tried calling the service centers in Kolkata nobody picks up the phone .The case of broken screen is evident when you browse the Mi forum .I did not lke the MIUI skin as some of the apps like call confirm do not work . . Overall very dissappointed
0|1|i have purchased 3days back i made till today only 1 call, result is 30 % battery gone in 1 hour and over heat, without using internet and phone calls. this very very bad exp.
1|1|FLIPKART feedback: The return policy is a scam. You will only get returns(no moneyback) and the "Easy Returns" is a scam as they have put in a technical team call (which just doesnt reach you) which is a pre-requisite. The call doesnt come but somehow they close the ticket and your return is rejected. Then you havce to raise another ticket and hope and pray that someone will not just close your ticket w/o speaking to you. Product feedback: PROS: Good phone for the price, if youa re willing to live with the following cons: 1) Heating issue - Customer service told me that 48 deg is acceptable heat. Imagine holding a 48deg rod in your hand..if you find that acceptable go for it. Though note that this is a intermittent issue. 2) Bluetooth connectivity problems - Canb use the handsfree bluetooth facility in my car anymore. 3) Selfie photos show up as mirror images 4) Phone hangs intermittently even though I only have whtaspp installed over and above the standard software The first 2 cons are deal-breakers for me, but may not be for all. So, take an informed decision. It's not peace of mind for the price though.
0|1|Charging Unit Not Working Properly Bad Communication Service Centre Not Give Support Till One Month and Flip Kart is a Flop Kart Because of Product And Services Given to Customer
0|1|The first time I bought the courier partner returned to seller as they say that they don't service in my area. So I contact the customer care and ask if they will be able to deliver next time I buy and they assured me that they will be able to deliver without any problem but the same thing happen. The worst part is that they take too much time in making the refund.
1|4|I have gone through so many reviews before buying this phone, But i was even shocked when i saw reviews with 45 degrees of heating. But the fact is not all phones reaches this temperature. I have been using this mobile for one month. If you have been so used to Samsung or Micromax phones. This may look so heated. But remember this has faster processor (None of your previous Samsung or Micromax) would have similar processor or using Multiple apps without delay. Frequent updates on the MIUI Part also is good to see that company whats the mobile to be kept updated. I have been hesitant about recommending the phone to anyone, But now I will i have seen enough, Full Movie. This Battery holds for One day on Normal usage (24x7 Data usage, Phone calls, Messages) DO NOT USE THIS PHONE DURING CHARGING, This phone has quick charging support and easily hits 42-43 degree while charging.
1|1|Hi , we should not encourage this type products. After MI 3 MI also trying to fool indian customers. Flip kart service is worst for MI products. Mobile should not get heat while charging and speaking with some one this is one of the best big con from MI Better to go for Lenovo products
1|1|this is the first time i bought the mobile on flash sale,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED the external speakers are not at all audioable if the phone is not handy. I asked for replacement the customer care cancelled our request, stating that change the ringtone... no use I even contacted the custor care of Xiaomi at 18001036286 they said contact FLIPKART persons they will replace it Again the volume of the external speakers while playing music keeps on decreasing by it self..... and can not be fixed even by manually increasing thru volume keys. phone gets heated when used long even if you do browsing or even on facebook. NEVER BUY ON FLASH SALES poor phone
1|1|Received the product intime. However has been giving problems. While the internet works perfectly over wifi. But on the phone network, I cannot browse google and cannot open playstore etc. The message I get is connection timed out. Called up Xiaomi customer service, who inturn did some trouble shooting and then told to get in touch with flipkart customer service. Experience with Flipkart customer service has been extremely bad. After repeated calls whn I asked to speak to a manager, I was told manager is busy, so I decided to hold the line....while im writing this review, im still waiting for the manager to come to the phone and talk to me and its been over 35 minutes now. Regret doing this transaction with Flipkart.
1|2|very poor quality touch pad not working properly not recommend... I requested flipkart to replace/return the set. They told me to give a call back from so called technical department. However, everytime they called and disconnected the call and postponing the call for next day... Return ID 19624776 request submitted dt 19/05/2015 and again request submitted with ID 19802708 dt 21/05/2015 but Issue not resolved till date...i am disappointed too much... Will not login back to flipkart in future.
1|1|AS PER SPECIFICATION IT SHOULD BE 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY. BUT ACTUALLY THE MOBILE TOTAL MEMORY IS 11.1 GB. DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT & WITH FLIPKART
0|4|Awesome device.. great build quality easy to use single handed, great camera's front and back both Best one is Mi series with dual Sim support. When we start device first time it loads OS first time setting up location, accounts, checking updates, syncing contacts , email etc, dual sim configuration and lots of things at a First time heating Problems take your time to make your review. packaging box we not recd earphones little bit confusing or misleading.
0|1|dont't but any one.frist of all they send me defective product.mi4i become hot within 30 sec like a iron. if you buy this phone you gone a die. and flipkart never gives you replacement or refund.so DON'T BUY.
0|1|The phone has heating issue, bad part is - when any alert comes, if not checked with in 5 to 10 mins, you will feel hot in your pocket, really bad. I asked replacement, if that phone also same issue than I need my money back. I do not want rate this even 1 star..! - Sanjay
1|1|I had registered and ordered this product on 30th April flash sale (OD202725038743026500). Before ordering I'd changed my mobile no also since my registered no was lost. I'd given my delivery location in Ghansoli which is my res address. I called up customer care (2nd May) to find out if the executive will come with swap machine, they chkd online and told me that that will not be available at Ghansoli. I requested to change the delivery location to my office address at Kanjurmarg. The executive on call changed the location but with my old phone no which was not working. Although I mentioned that I've chnaged my no but he was not bothered to chk the new no to be given for shipment. As a result eCatr logistics tried to call me up 3 times to the no the executive mentioned with the order but it was switched off. Somehow I contacted eCart to help the delivery guy to deliver me the order but they told that the shipment was not with him although it was with the person only I called up which I came to know later. I was tired calling up caustomer care as they told they have nothing to do and suggested me to cancel the order and reorder a new one. Finally I did so on 7th May and got the delivery from the same eCart executive who had my earlier order. Althouth I called up same person earlier he denied and said that he is not having the order. Also with my surprise the same person was leaving with my new order without even calling me and delivering me because he was thinking order is same with my old no. Fortunately I called up the person and he told me that he is having the new order with him, that time he told that the old order was also with him. When i asked why it was not delivered earlier he had no answer. Terrific job done by Flipkart online executive (forgot his name) and moreover the person from eKart logistics (which is a part of Flipkart only). A a result I suffered a delay of around 10 days for nothing in delivery and missed some important calls and messages as I lost my phone and waiting for the new one, the other phone I'm having is CDMA.V V V Poor service from Flipkart !!! Beware !!!
1|1|had purchased many products earlier... before u wanna purchase just wish to god ki aapka product kharab na nikle... 19may ko kharab mobile receive hua aur abhi tak courier wala wapas nahi le gaya... and they mailed ki 13 june se pehle mobile aa jayega,,, after sales service is TOTALLY ZERO... flipkart hv to wrk on replacement policies... i agree mobile kharab nikal sakta hai... but dear flipkart we are purchasing ur product coz of u... not coz of any seller... pls take this msg seriously...
0|1|Flipkart is selling low quality chinese devices. These phone not even basic call feature is working. No return for this device. Minus rating for this. Not worth.
0|5|very nice product, received in time thnxx to flipkart.... ....
0|1|Mobile heats up on normal usage of calling for 5 mins. Called Flipkart for replacement but no proper response as usual. Highly frustrated with this defective piece and Flipkart. No proper response till today. Its already 8 days
0|1|Received an over heating device, since then trying to contact the customer care. But no Response. Horribly disappointing disgusting pathetic service by the biggest e-tailer of the country. Would like to get my refund asap. Wont come back if this continues.
0|1|Flipkart sent me the defective piece, after 10 days of complain i have not received any replacement or refund,
0|3|Every thing is awesome apart from these 3 things: 1. Worst battery backup have ti charge twice a day for minimal usage even on singe sim that is again on 2G network. 2. No memory card option. 3. Not responsive at times. I have taken many products from but i have problem with this phone, requested for replacement 12 days back, irresponsible team... sad thing is post sale service is worst by Flipkart..
0|3|I did lot of transactions with Flipkart, but this one was the worst experience. You guys need to improve your delivering the product in time
0|1|I bought it recently and not happy with the product. The phone getting heated whenever you access 3G data, upon video calls and even speaking more than ten minutes. I contacted flipkart customer service team and they ask you to install some app to test the temperature of the device when it idle. Then it normal but the fact is that when you start using it getting heated.. Not even tested playing by games or you tube videos. Your ears will be getting heated.. I request flipkart to refund the money and waiting for their response. The customer care executives reluctant to accept refund request when I raised the request. So I am bit disappointed with this product and suspecting flipkart now..
1|1|Regarding features. It is just like any other phone of its category with meizu m1 note a very tough competitor. The phone gets heated up to 45-50 degree Celsius. I asked for return and refund request from flipkart. They asked me to do some troubleshooting and install some apps. After that the temperature to 38-40 degrees. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND (NO PUN INTENDED) I was being told "Sir your phone is just heating upto 38-40 degrees. If it had been heating over 45 degrees then we would have considered your request for refund." YES YOU READ IT RIGHT!! THEY WONT DO ANYTHING IF YOUR PHONE CAN BOIL MAGGI. IF IT COULD BOIL EGGS, THEN MAYBE YOU HAVE A CHANCE He kept repeating take it to service center. I live in Varanasi and service center is in patna or kanpur. They expect me to cover kms even though a phone received on 6th may wont be refunded by them. Gross case of customer right violations. Retards if you are so hell bent on sticking to 45 degrees criterion (which I am sure is a farce!!) I dare you to mention on product page. I wonder if even one person will buy this piece of shit to MAKE MAGGI. ALL PEOPLE READING THIS: Please give one star to this piece of shit and submit your review as "I GIVE ONE STAR BECAUSE OD302723795588122200 Mi 4i COULDN'T BOIL EGGS" This will make them realize that not any customer is to be treated as trash. Flipkart you try to brand yourself as Indian Company?? Amazon has 30-day "NO QUESTION ASKED" return policy. The only thing you are Indian Currently is stinginess and you are worse than Local Kirana Store!!!
0|1|Hi Guys i took this phone from flipkart on last sale and after that my excitement changed into frustration and anger. Pros:- sleek and light. cons:- Too much Battery Heating . Application Crashing. Its Body is not look like 13000/- phone look like cheap Plastic and No external memory. If you are ready to spend 13000/- better go for another product and get lot of features price wise phone is not worth. In 16 GB 12 GB is available for use and that finishes off very soon you cant do any thing. I have already requested for refund and waiting for response as per flip kart battery temp can go.up to 45 degree and it is normal. This i am hearing first time then how do you talk holding the phone.
0|1|Once again Red Mi & Flip kart cheated by sending defected piece..I want to buy this phone but bad experience.. Red Mi Note 4G Defected Returned Red MI 4i Defected Returned Once again purchased M 4i and after receiving the same found different labelling on Mobile & all its accessories of Self Declaration Confirming to IS 13252 (Part 1) 2010. Still confused about product originality status..
0|2|I bought the Mi 4i from snap sale from Flipkart after seeing the phone launch video. I am not gr8ly happy due to following :- (a) The sound is discouragingly low in volume. (b) It's just about a week since using the phone, but having issues with charging.mi 4i I got from flipkart does not charge fully...It just stops charging intermittently and do not get 100% charged (c) Mi 4i help line 1800 103 6286 takes hours to attend and their chat is no different.
0|2|The mic is not working. Problem occurs very randomly. I was asked for the amsrt check app that time it worked fine but as i said it is ramdom so i sometimes does not work. have placed a return request again.
0|3|1. BATTERY DRAINS FAST WHILE SURFING 2. OVER HEATING ISSUE 3. NO AFTER SALES SERVICE DEAR FLIPKART WE TRUST YOUR BRAND NAME AND EXPECT ONTIME AFTER SALES SERVICE , SO WHILE SIGNING MOU WITH ELECTRONIC GIANTS MAKE SURE THEY PROVIDE AFTER SALES SERVICE AT EVERY NOOK AND CORNER OF COUNTRY.
0|1|Phone performance and looks are very good and best price for this smart phone. The phone is getting heated even if I charge the phone,if i take more than 1 photograph, if i play a basic game and many more. I took this up with Flipkart (remember i am Flipkart First Customer) and strangely Flipkart took 3 days to contact me. I finally got the call but no one was speaking - after 5seconds the called got hanged. Then i receive a message saying that my return request is denied....there is no reason mentioned. Strange that they dont even tell us the reason for denial. I am very upset with this service and i will now re-think buying any product from Flipkart.
1|1|in the time of call from other OR if i will go to make a call to another number the display goes to blank...i cant see anything on the display. whenever i wish to make a call naturally i push the power button to open the display, suddenly the display has gone to black. what is the funny thing!! i told to replace the "GREAT Mi4i" to flipkart, but they are taking time to repair by sending one application ("SmartChk''). i am still suffering and waiting spending Rs.13000/- !!!!!
0|5|sir mane mi4i mare phone me heting problam ha or mana kae bar complent ke par koe jab nahi aaya
0|5|First of all excellent service by Flipkart. Delivered before the promised date Actually got the faulty device (touch was not working properly) then got the replacement Flipkart replaced with new mobile in just one day :) ***** to Flipkart Device: Excellent,Superb Display and look and feel nice Very light weight Never Faced heating Issues - Played Asphalt 8 in HD Mode with Performance option enable in Battery for nearly 30 minutes. Normal Heating only not too much Installed navimaps for GPS navigation and GPS lock is very fast No MicroSD card slot but not an issue for me Battery last for me more than one day - Normal usage
1|1|I bought this mobile on the 14th may flash sale. I read the reviews but I thought people are exaggerating the slight things. The mobile does get heated up but not to very great extent (yes, more than the other branded mobiles). But the main problem I am facing is the internet/connectivity problem. I have 3G/4G airtel connection, but internet doesnt work. I checked with 2 service providers - same problem. However, same sim in any other mobile is working fine. I am disappointed with Xiaomi as well as Flipkart. Have filed for a return 3 days back and their response is not upto the mark- they seem to be playing the delaying tactics. I only wish Flipkart should ve been a bit more responsible in promoting such products.
1|1|There is a huge gap between display glass and panel in the bottom of the phone and overheating and hanging while playing small game like fruit ninja, it’s a non-removable panel so water and dust getting inside the same thing conveyed to the Flipkart team to replace the product, but they denied to accept as manufacturing defect within 10 days of delivery and they are saying they have their own policy, so what about the 30days return policy. How fair? to visit the store for manufacturing defect. Please value the customers money and feelings and replace the product ASAP.
0|1|Phone was heating up very much even if it is in ideal mode.Phone ringtone is very slow.Touch is not very smooth.Sometimes phone become hang and touch does not work.application take very much time to load even if phone has 2GB RAM.Most of the time application crashed and phone hanged.
0|1|Viewers or Phone lovers - Pls do not buy this phone as Flipkart and Xiaomi both planned to sell this worst product by creating artificial hype. Read carefully - you will come to know there is no return facility for this product. Why such decision taken by seller "WS Retail" because they know once user will see and use it they will definitely try to return this and seller won't accept it. Flipkart making it's own business by selling these cheap chinese phones and making it's own profit. And we are the ultimate losers. Major problem of this phone - 1. voice clarity is not much clear when you are listening. 2. Battery backup is bad.It drains out very quickly if you are on 3G. 3. Ringtone sound is very low even you set it to maximum. 4. Phone is having heating issue. 5. No headphone provided.
0|4|After havin initially delivered a defective piece, Flipkart responded appreciably well to my concern and helped deliver a new device within the same week....!!!!! Thanks to Flipkart customer care.................. As for the phone...Amazing touch screen....Incredible camera.... On the whole it is worth the price..............
0|1|worst item Mi 4i from xiaomi through flipkart. There is a problem in the sound system of the phone so I complaint about it on flipkart but they said that the sound system is ok and have no problem and they don't help me in any means. I have used others mobiles from flipkart also and there is no problem in them but in this phone they did not support the customer. I will purchase anything from flipkart now if they sold these cheap products.
0|1|There was so much hype created about this product on Internet but it doesn't full fill the expectation. I got this product in the first sale and my expectation was really high but once I opened the box the illusion was vanished. It looks like a cheap plastic box. I can't comment about the performance as I have got faulty product, I kept this phone on testing before completely switching over this handset. The mobile gets heated while kept on idle position. Whenever I am making a call the receiver is unable to hear my voice.The Bluetooth is unable to pair with my I-phone/ I-pad and laptop also. When I wrote this mail to Flipkart CS department to return or exchange the product they simply refused to do it. First they want to check the product through smart app which I have installed that app and informed them by phone and now waiting for their expert to call and check the handset. I won't advise anyone to go for this handset as it won't full fill your expectation it's a hype or smart marketing strategy adopted by Xiaomi. I also strongly criticise the kind of support given by the Flipkart regarding this problem.
1|1|hi i am facing so many problem i have to your customer care so i want exchange this product or amount refund in my as ap
1|2|Hi, I got much awaited mi4i today. I am facing one issue, I am not able to take screenshot with "Vol low button + power button". Can anyone help me? Thanks
0|4|I got a phone with two dead pixels and I requested a replacement. After sharing some troubleshooting tips to remove them which didn't worked, flipkart agreed for replacement, and I promptly got a new one and it is flawless. They phone is good in all aspects. I feel an expandable memory will complete the phone 100%.
0|1|I received the Mi4 phone (yesterday) , It has worst touch I have seen so far. I called flipkart for replacement they rejected the replacement request saying phone is fine, asked me to visit service center for repairs. there is no policy for replacement for this phone ( according to the agent) cons 1.Touchscreen of this phone is terrible with poor calibration.( you click something it clicks opens something else here is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NhRAeC88EI 2.Heats up ( I still havent put the simcard on it though ) 3. restart without any reason
1|1|Flipkart ..! My fav online shopping portal. 1. Display Very good. 2. Camera Mind blowing. 3. Slim Body less weight. This device is ruining your goodwill. Battery draining problem is an big problem & that's not enough i'm also facing lagging & hanging problem. Before start using it i have properly updated the device & run the same in balance mode but still i'm facing the above mentioned problems. I can't understand why my phone is hanging. 2GB ram doesn't supposed to hanging the device before that i was using lumia 720 there is no lagging & heating issue. And i found some kind of sound like some loose part(Nut,bolt) near primary camera. Kindly replace the device & fix Heating & hanging problem at the earliest. If u can't so just give my money back.
1|4|Its pathetic phone.Please don't purchase as they have very poor after sales services.Initially I was happy but my phone glass broke on slight press.After that they are charging 5.5 K which is half the price of phone.Its also very difficult to find service centre here in Jharkhand.I would suggest people not to bye the phone as the phone is not durable.
0|1|I got mi4i phone on 16-05-2015 MI4i Phone is looking good but it has a too much heating. I can’t put phone on face for calling because it’s too much hot & it’s burn & medically affect my skin. I am very disappointed. Mi4i Heating problem is not described anywhere on flipkart or mi4i website. I called flipkart & tell them about it. Flipkart give me ring next day & check my phone with their personal app & they found that phone & battery is heating around 50C’ Flipkart replaced this phone new one will get soon. But, Problems is I have seen too much reviews on flipkart & all are complaining about heating problem, So replace will not solutions of my problem. So, I don’t want to replace phone & return back of my hard earning money from flipkart. But flipkart can’t refund my money back I don’t know about this policy. Ok but I will challenge this policy in a court soon. I am very excited when I saw mi4i launching video on you tube they had never ever told or saw that phone will be heated. Now, I feel that I am cheated.
0|4|I was a lucky one amongst the lot to get the MI 4i during the first flash sale. The flipkart delivery was pretty prompt. I heard from a colleague of mine, that he got the phone delivered the next day at 8:30 AM after the flash sale. Keep it up flipkart. There are many quality reviews of the phone available on the net, a large number of them very positive. I don't have anything more to add to that. The only sore point, the Xiaomi promised "freebie" screen guard hasn't arrived even after two weeks !!
0|1|Phone has stopped working after 2 hours . Not getting charged , not starting. Replace this defective piece asap
0|5|hi guys mobile performannce awesome .i used many phones sony,samsung,appli iphone 6,really its outstanding mobile .its great thing to mi...........thanx alot to mi and FLIPKART................SUPER QUALITY CAMERA AND MOBILE....I NEVER FELL HEATING ....dont care otherswords......if u want to 13000 range its bestest mobile in this world........once again thanks flipkart team
0|5|Earlier i was hell confused to order it or not but after reading all these reviews. I mustered courage taking somewhat risk cause i had bought 3 mobiles from flipkart and it had never disapponted me so i just went for it. I received it on 16th may When i unwraped the pack took mobile out it was too light and switched it on OMG what a fascinating display cristal clear HD video can be played. I didn't face heating issue too much it happens when u charge it and use it simultaneously. I had used so many android phones and it happens with all smart phones. As you guys already read all its features it proved it quite impressively WITHOUT DOUBT YOU CAN GO FOR IT For sure you can't get this much of feature at this price
1|2|This is my Order No for MI 4I- OD302784274650140100, order No for Redmi 2-OD302542686705082200, HI, I purchased Redmi 2 mobile, last 2months back - for that mobile camera,video recording,display and everything as of now is good. And I am telling all my colleagues that that Redmi 2 Mobile is good, for a price of 6999 its very good(even I have posted very good feedback about that mobile on Flipkart).based on that little bit tempted in buying this mobile. Thought that if a 6999 mobile is good then, how about 12999, will be awesome and extraordinary. But don’t go for this, reason is- 1…..is over heat issue. the temprature of battery is going up to 41C from 36C while charging the mobile, with video recording it went up to 43C, where as the Redmi 2 moble is going up to 37C while in Charging, I have Micromax mobile also its also 1C variation, if you keep at Cheek or at ear, you can see very hot feeling. 2……. the battery is inbuilt..so after 1year or 6months usage, or some times if mobile hangs up then you need to wait for 30min to 1Hr to get it back to normal(as of now I didnt faced, but one of my colleague advised not to go for inbuilt battery, 3…...two days back the camera, didn’t opened and software shown some message as “cant connect to Camera, restart the mobile”..So I switched off the mobile and later on it got started, ( to be frank i didnt downloaded any apps-other than the provided by Flipkart, and also not more than 15Camera Pictures kept in Camera)its showing overheat while charging..the plus points is..Good Camera Quality, (but video quality is not much good comparing Redmi 2, even in low light the Redmi 2 has given good quality, but not MI 4I), Display is good and attracting. Slim Mobile. I have taken all the reviews very light, as kept over confidence on this mobile, basis my Redmi 2 mobile liking..now I am suffering. I am not sending this message, with any anger..it is just for the sake of you. I can get a replacement or may not..definitely this mobile will work for 1year sure(as there is a warranty for battery for 6months and for mobile one year, if any one who is going for a mobile for 6months or for one year, then we can definitely go for this mobile and enjoy with it Camera quality, good display..but if any one is looking for a Mobile usage for long time of 3 to 5 yrs, have to think..
0|1|Not upto the mark.. BATTERY & HEATING ISSUE IS THE MAJOR DRAWBACK THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING Touch---- fine Processing--- fine and sometimes few apps stucks Camera---- just ok Heating is major issue; heats quickly for normal camera usage. with 3G u can just iron clothes. Battery --- for normal use 1 day else charge it frequently. Built Quality--- Not looks like a brand... cheap Chinese mobile types Flipkart must confirm the quality of the product before they selling new products, i m totally disappointed with this. Support for Flipkart is also worse. They dont respond even after 2-3 times of complaining. No replacement or refund.
1|5|great................................................................................................................
0|1|I got the defective mi 4i. speaker not working and i am unable to get sound in earphn too... ""Highly dissapointed ""........
0|1|The Audio quality of the phone is pathetic and one can hardly hear anything when in speaker mode. Also there is a design flaw with the phone - the speaker is located on the back side of the phone. Hence when the phone is kept on its back (which is usually how you would place a phone) on any surface, you can hardly hear the ring when the phone rings. All this has detrimental effect on the alarm, phone rings and speaker phone ability. The service from Flipkart was VERY VERY bad and the service executive tried to convince me his best that there is nothing wrong with the phone and that I am a wrong person if I find anything wrong with the phone. He made me download an app to check the performance of the phone and said that the app is proving that the phone is working perfectly. When I asked him how can the app tell if the volume is low, he had no answer and kept repeating like a moron that I am wrong to find anything wrong with the phone. I finally asked to speak with the manager to convey my problem and he said he will arrange a call back. That call has never come and I am stuck with a defective phone which Flipkart is refusing to take back.
0|1|Phone specs are good, but what the use if your speaker volume is so low that it's hard to listen even at full volume and you will loose your incoming calls. Data connectivity is dropping all the times and no internet connectivity, battery works as 2000mA I have requested for replacement, but the Flipkart play around to avoid replacement by make the replacement request to pass through technical test, where they use their own hardware checking app and check over phone the status and pass all the test and reject my replacement request. Where I am using the phone and I am suffering the above mentioned problem. As per their technician the Speaker volume is like this, battery and connectivity too, That mean if my Mi4i hardware is good, then the phone have manufacturing problem. Xiaomi should take the ownership. They just cheat customers by saying that they will return the purchase item. my Snapdeal experience was good, they just return the item without asking a question if the customer is not satisfied. Flipkat grow from book selling ecommerce to this stage, now they don't bother customer satisfaction. some day they will also realise when customer like me loose confidence and afraid to buy product from flipkart.
1|1|Hi, I brought Mi4i day before yesterday and i updated for MIUI 2.0 after that my display is not working :(
1|4|Awesome device.. except heating of it's battery.. when I unboxed it the phone really amazed me. The build quality is good ..Can MI fix this heating issue through a software update ?
0|1|I do not see any Pros in this phone. There are other very good phones at this price level. Camera quality: They boast of having 13 MP camera (Samsung/Sony). Definitely it is not up to standard. Sometime you feel you are using 5 MP camera. Heating issue: You can use it as ironing clothes. Flipkart's refund policy : When you call customer care, they tell all the bullshit remedy steps which is not useful at all. It doesn't help you much. So they will not refund you , if you ask for cancelling of this product. Whatever the product reviews you are getting on this website, is by flipkart people and not by genuine buyers. It is just to confuse people. Please stay away from flipkart and this product. My experience is really worst with flipkart guys and this product. I want to rate 0 for this one. But minimum 1 is manadatory.
0|1|I have been using this device from last 10 days and not happy with the heating issue. everything is fine but this heating issue is making this device unusable. It is causing pain in the ears while talking and also headache. They have advised me to resetting the device but problem is still persisting and made a complained again. lets see what solution they will provide to me. I will update the same after getting reply from flipkart.
0|1|I PURCHASED MI4I LAST WEEK, I HAVE LOT OF PROBLEM IN THIS MOBILE & FLIPKART NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT & ALSO DID'T RUFUND.
0|5|It is superb in finishing. Camera and video is very nice. Performs nicely in GPRS & Wi-Fi. Price reasonable and worth its value. However, problem with Flipkart, IMEI in Invoice does not match with the IMEI of the handset. This happened earlier also during my purchase of Wi-Fi router, took many follow ups to get the corrected invoice. So when buying through Flipkart please check the invoice for Sl.No./ IMEI carefully.
0|3|Bought in first flash sale.... General experience with device is OK. A bit odd interface for typical Android User. While attending the calls heats up fast and just after 2 min one can feel heat on ear. Do not know whether problem with piece of general issue. Requested a return and refund...lets see what flipkart does.
0|1|ekart Logistics in Rajahmundry is very bad services. they did not inform are without any call to customer they simply add in tracking " pin code address mismatch". that address are past successfully delivered by ekart Logistics. I have full evidence. im flipkart first customer what about normal customers.
1|1|I was purchase MI4I on dated 07/05/2015 and received the product on 11/05/2015 when i was check the product i found there was no accessory in the box. so i was call to flipkart customer care and inform the same after putting my call on hold more then 20 min they request for reverse pick up the will be scheduled on dated 19/05/2015 when i check this on flipkart the cancel the reverse pickup request by itself again i make a call to flipkart and wasted my 15 min but issue was not resolved. i call again n they told me reverse pick up take time so they credit rs.500 in my wallet when i check then no use of this amount because i can only use against the seller this amount. Seller don't have any accessory with him to sale so no use of that amount after that i repetitively calling and mailing to flipkart for the solution but not yet any solution is provided by them. so please it's my request to you all no customer support is provided by them now days so avoid buying from flipkart.
1|1|Got this phone today "15 may"!! By look phone it's too awesome!!! Easy to handle and with the black back case it too stylish as well!! However, my phone was damaged, There was a led leakage at the bottom of the phone. Now, I have raised a ticket for the replacement!! I will definitely give a honest review, once I get the new phone and test everything!!!
0|1|I ordered the Mi4i on the very first sale and received a defective phone on complaining i got a replacement that too was defective. Cant trust the quality of testing now. Both the time the screen was faulty
0|1|I got mobile on the first sale.The heating is so bad that it is unbearable to make a call...It gets really hot close to the camera side and front top side.when we are calling in only two minute of continues talk phone becomes over heated upto 50 degree ..flipkart change me phone once but in another piece the same probem occur .. so please dont buy it ....
1|1|After I opened the box what i saw was unbeleivable. I felt cheated. The phone is very weak. Build and screen wise. I felt misled by claims made by flipkart. First time i felt why I purchased this product .... If you still want to buy then you are wasting your money.
0|3|Good phone in the mentioned budget; big issue with heating problem while using camera/ apps/ movie/ etc... please suggest how to resolve this heating problem one more slighter issue with night photography, pictures are coming with red eye effect. please suggest how can solve this problem also
0|1|Third grade phone with flipkart third grade customer service.return request raised on 3rd may,till date flipkart customer team is lingering the issue.
0|5|Excellente service by Flipkart! My Mi4i Delivered on time. I found the screen crack, and raised complaint with Flipkart CCare. I got replacement product in quick turnaround. I appreciate that Flipkart support and value its customers. I will keep on shopping with Flipkart! Cheers! Flipkart you rock !! Thank you !
0|1|last time flipkart u cancelled my order ( xiaomi mi4i ). i m again buying this product this time u delever me my buying item at given time n date, with good quality. no any resone give me.
1|1|Getting Very Heat While Playing .....................................................................
1|5|First things first, the price segment makes Mi 4i; a kickass phone to have. Overall experience is really overwhelming. No lagging or sluggish behaviour in whole day usage. Multitasking is super smooth as well as the gaming experience. It justifies every penny spent.........kudos to Xiaomi :)
0|1|Only one issue ... and its a major one ... It heats up to an unbearable extent. I had requested a return , hope flipkart will help.
0|3|i have purched mi4i from flipkart order no. OD302724959748660000 on dated 30 April, 2015 5:15 PM. In this mobile i have faced heating problem when calling or operate the mobile above 3-4 minutes. So please resolve my problem.
1|5|be should expadable memory and 32gb internal ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|Horrable service from Flipkart, I have purchased this mobile from the very 1st day and when I opened and started I was shocked to see the left hand side touch is not working and calling in Flipkart to solve the problem to exchange the piece but they are refusing and telling for trouble shooting calling from last 4days but not at all getting help from flipkart.
0|1|Dear All, Please dont purchase this phone it is a very bad phone which i ever seen. I dont know about other customers experience but really it is very bad. Think 100 times before planning to purchase this phone.
0|1|It is the worst Mi smartphone I have ever used. Mi3 was awesome, Mi4 was good too but Mi4i it just isn't worth buying. It gets so hot that it is not comfortable to hold. If you check the temperature, it soars well above 60C which is substantially hot. I asked flipkart for a refund and instead was provided a replacement, and seeing the reviews I bet whether this unit will be any different.
0|1|I got the phone Mi 4i on 11-May-2015 since then I am unable to use Mobile Inter Data. WiFi is working fine. I have called up MI customer care who gave me certain guidance even after implementing that the problem has not been resolved. It is bad that after spending so much money you can not use the gadget. I have earlier purchased Moto G (2 Gen.) that was great.
1|1|Was among the first few to place the online order. But the excitement was extremely short-lived. Five times payment made by credit card but rejected by Flipkart due to some "technical issue"....12999 x 5 = Rs.64995 credit limit blocked out within minutes !! Waiting for reversal of dues. Sixth time, COD order placed - item not delivered...ultimately order cancelled after long wait, on 13 May 2015 ! Pathetic state of affairs, Flipkart ! Would have loved to assign Zero star, if provision existed !
0|5|Less than 10 days of use sometimes pixel getting stucked. Green dot appearing. Flipkart should replace such and handset. Its less than 10 days........................
0|1|Received this product on time, But, the very first day of use I've faced the heating issue. I haven't installed a big or high graphics games. Its a normal game, which did not require any high configuration. The phone heated so badly that it's developed a bulge on the left and right side of the screen. I've notified the Flipkart team for the same, but haven't heard positive response from their side. And continuously receiving the email "We regret to inform that seller has disapproved your return request". The phone is 30 days replacement warranty from Flipkart and seller denied to return. Read and think twice before you go for next purchase. I'm still fighting with the issues and waiting for to see how flipkart team resolve it.
0|1|I received the phone via flipkart yesterday. The phone got heated several times - during chargin, during call, during normal browsing, during listening music(not over 10 minutes). I need replacement / my money back. Features no doubt are good otherwise. Flipkart delivery as usual good.
0|4|Received the handset and charger in the box....satisfied with the handset,but would have been delighted if would have received the screen guard, earphones and backcovers ,etc.....now it is getting tedeious to source these accessories.
0|3|I have received a box saying battery 3030mAh. Specifications says Mi4i comes with 3120 mAh Battery. Why there is so big difference ?
1|1|here we go: Got Mi4i, put the SIM and guess want , i cant make calls. It says No SIM or SIM error. Same sim works fine in other phones. Best part is Flipkart says, i cant get a refund.....
0|1|Not up to expectation. Getting heated in 5 minutes talk and charging get disconnected while incoming messages. I need to return but flipkart is offering replacement only on the damaged product.. Not good
0|1|After using it for 5 Days: PROS: 1) Display 2) Size is Handy and LightWeight. 3) Battery Backup Cons: 1) Heating issue while Taking Pics, Making Calls, Using Internet(15 min) this is the reason of more battery backup. U can't use your phone continuously more that 20 min, Again wait for 10 to 15 min for cooldown. 2) Loudspeaker sound it is too low. U can,t hear your ringtone if u are 2-3 mtr away(good thing is it has vibration mode so u can feel some one is calling). 3) Rear/Back Camera is nowhere in comparison to mi3. 4) Asphalt 8 Lags even in performance mode. 5) Non Removable Back Panel and Battery. If Phone Lags just wait bcoz u can't remove battery and restart. 6) Limited Storage of 10 Gb. No memory card slot. 7) No Headphones. 8) No Screen guard. 9) A/C to Flipkart more than 90% set are Defective. Bcoz before purchasing this they told that some defective product is having heating issues. But as per my observation each mi 4i have heating issue. So,Conclusion is flipkart is selling diffective product with scheme of replacing defactive product with another defective product. Last but not the least Hugo barra the biggest liar 1) flagship 2) No Heating issue with 2nd gen processor. Moto g2 will be far better than this with 2000 less price.
0|1|I am totally disappointed with this mobile. Mobile battery is not getting charge and heating problem.......I m going to return this product
0|5|NICE DISPLAY...GOOD LOOK......NICE CAM.............................................................................................................................................................................................
0|1|Received the Mi4i today. Just opened the box and stared... Its has issues with display. It is having some kind of YELLOWISH gradient on the screen.
1|5|The mi4i sent for my order is defective. Camera not working Flash light not working Random Reboots Good for nothing mobile for now. Wait for 4 to 5 months then buy this mobile. It is the worst phone i ever bought. Requested replacement to get a new phone
1|5|Really fast delivery. thanx flipkart, received this product before time. Had a great experience buying on flipkart.
0|1|I am perhaps the first customer to buy it on 30th April flash sale. I literally waited for the countdown to finish and bought the mobile within minutes, right @ 2pm. I was this much exited to buy this mobile. Went through many YouTube videos, both from India and around the world. The anticipation was high. But all in vain. Let me explain the serious issues with the phone (or perhaps my phone at hand), 1. The overall look was awesome right out of the box. As soon I inserted the SIM card the back of the phone was like a cooking oven. I found out the reason in blogs. The whole mother board is very congested and sitting @ 1"x0.5" area below the back camera. Xiaomi did this to fit a bigger battery while keeping the phone thin. 2. The sound speakers are of no use. I can barely hear the ring even in a quite room. Let alone the songs\vdos @ full volume. Feels like this phone is meant to use in a Church. 3. The main & the most painful issue is with the network settings. This issue kicked in as soon as i upgraded to MiUi6 inter phase. Whenever I turn off my Wifi and want to connect with 3G my phone does not connect to the 3G network mobile data. I have 3G enabled, 3G balance, good network everything. The only solution I found is, to goto my APN settings, create a new APN, manually input all the server, proxy, port,MCC, MCN details to make the 3G work again. This also works 60-40 times, not always. I have to keep resetting the APN and do a trial n error method. Again when I connect and discount with a Wifi mobile data stops working. Can't even open google home page from chrome, for some reason WhatsApp is working sometime (can't explain why). 4. Most of the time I have no notifications in my home screen even though my notifications settings are proper. Its been a week I'm using the mobile. Starting to regret the decision of buying the product without more research. If someone can explain what is happening and how to fix this that will be great. O.w. I already raised a issue with Flipkart and returning the product.
0|1|I received this phone on 8th and it was working all good, (though i have not used any sim card) on saturday when i had my existing sim card cut into micro sim and inserted to this new phone the problem was seen when you dial any number the phone screen goes black and you do not have any option to see the screen nor you will be able to disconnect the call until the call get disconnect by its own or you power off the phone This is really a terrible fault as you are left with no option to access the phone for that period of time..... I have asked flipkart for a replacement, lets see what they come up with....till now i havent heard anything back from them yet
0|1|on the Brand name of Xiomi, I had purchase this product on 1st sale, so many problem is present in this phone, Like if phone is in switchoff mode then its not take charge, during call waiting Phone is totally Hanged , and not able to operate even, too bad experiences with this purchase... I blindly trust on flipkart, but this time they are doing a fraud with trust...so many others problem are their, I suggest , please do not buy this product, if you have plaing for a long call then you can not bearing the hit...
0|5|Good and faster delivery, nice product using for the past 2 days. But flipkart to improve the feedback system, asking to write 100 words min to accept the online feedback
0|3|IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THAT WHEN THE SET IS CONNECTED TO THE PC, THE LANGUAGE IS CHINESE AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO OPTION FOR ENG OR ANY INDIAN LANGUAGE. THE MANUAL WITH THE SET IS NOT UPTO THE MARK AND PROVIDES VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS AND SETTINGS. NO HEADPHONE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HENCE BE READY TO RUSH TO MKT FOR THIS TINY THING BEFORE YOU LISTEN TO FM. HOPE THE CO. WOULD RESOLVE THESE SMALL ISSUES WHICH ARE PROBLEMATIC.
1|1|Firstly I have concluded like everyone else the phone heating a lot. even on simple app using or browsing for few minutes on wifi (not even 3g) its heats up. and yes, even on quad core, there is lag some times, while playing on subway surfer, I noticed the screen touch just don't work few times. MIUI has some bugs as I noticed some unnatural flashing at bottom of screen. also the most disappointing the sound. very very poor audio levels. i thought it would be great as on website it has mentioned something as Smart PA for good audio levels. overall below average product for below average user. do not expect performance and value for money. just a look is Ok if u can ignore cheap quality back plastic.
1|1|plz dont buy this phone i got this phone i contact with flipkart they laging the issue 10 days they postponing the call every time . i got 45 degrees heat and i sended to then snap but no use . plz dont buy , i will be in issue . true 15 days used then only we are saying to users .
1|1|I have faced the below problem in this hand set 1.The PA speaker output sound is very low. I always miss the call. Dont go to buy it if you don't want to miss your calls. Though specification is good mentioned by the manufacturer, the basic requirement i.e. Ringing sound is very low makes the phone unusable. 2. I am having the back lit problem. Light is coming out from down right side of the phone(exactly down side to the Back and Home button). Escalated the issues to Flipkart. Hopping for a Quick resolution.
0|5|This is really a good phone. I didnt get any issues on heating as such. Only complain is sometimes the UI animations is not that smooth which i thin can be solved with software update. Good battery...awesome screen...great build quality
1|1|While the product is very good from a foam factor, look and feel. The phone is switching off every 2 mins and hence im unable to use the phone. Have raised a call with Flipkart for replacement. Not sure if this will ever happen. One of my previous request also fell on deaf ears of flipkart where they kept saying some one will call and no one ever called. Flipkart is snooping to new lows day by day. I always enjoyed buying on flipkart due to their customer service. Now i will think twice.
0|3|In Packing Box and Official Specification Difference A. Processor -1.6 GHz (About Phone-> CPU ) -1.65 Ghz (Box packaging ) -1.7 Ghz (official Site) ? B. Battery -3120 mAh (official Site 4.4V) -3030 mAh (Box Packaging ??) -?mAh (Test->Battery Information->4136mV) After sale service?? if these above terms. not matter for you, Then go for it, got it, otherwise awesome android phone. :-)
1|5|awesome phone . no heating problem.no lagging.its fast.awesome camera.good flashnd one problem i found its sound is low
1|1|Guyz, please do not buy this phone!!!!!!!!!!You will lose your money. This phone heats up to 40 degrees and above with light usage. The flipkart customer care doesn't care a damn about it and refuse the return and refund even though they have a friendly return policy. All they keep saying is "I Understand" and "I am Sorry" Warning: If there is heating issues with the phone, flipkart will not refund your money.Buy this at your own risk.
0|1|I have ordered the product & without confirming the same was cancelled by showing a reason the address is not rechargeable by courier partner. They didnt give an option to give a new adress for the delivery as well.
0|1|I bought this phone recently. And i ever seen so bad phone. sound is not working at all. i would suggest my friends do not buy this phone if this phone is not tested properly. this is my genuine feedbackthere is no ratings below 1 otherwise i could have done it
1|1|it has netwrk problem with 3g batter drains fast and hangs i am not satisfied with it so kindly refund i dont want replacement of set
1|1|really good phone but must avoid due to one is the most terrible heating problem. and second 3050 mh battery wont even last half a day with moderate use. not worth spending the money. no matter what people say. i say the phone heats up and really heats up too much. requested flipkart for refund/ return but now since majority of people facing the heating issue flipkart is taking back step for return/refund request due to losses it will face caused by hundreds of return request of mi4i phones. people read the news don just read the reviews.
0|1|I have bought the Mi 4i and got delivery on 04/05/2015, after pre inspection i have got that it has major fault, its getting temperature more then 46 'C with in 15-20 min use of phone, if it use motre than that may be it will be blast too . regarding the matter i have discussed as well as complained to the flipkart, in reply they getting reference to his policies and wrote the re-grate text . Now i cant use my Mi 4i mobile because of fault and i have lost my money too After all i am the victim one of flipkart I never aspect-ed service like it form flipkart SO SAD
0|1|This phone got heating issues. even small Trasks like what app, browsing , call etc heats my ear. Can someone guide me how to return this product.?
1|1|I bought Mi4i in first sale of Flipkart. facing following issues: 1) Internet doesn't work. Videos/ Playstore doesnt open even on 3G network. 2) It is heating up. 3) Flipkart guys dont return it if you want to get it replaced with another high valued phone. Dont waste your money. Gurpreet
1|1|This phone has some fatal issues. CPU is getting really hot within 5 mins for normal usage like whatsapp & fb etc.. You cant talk more than 10 mins in the call. Only option is you have to use headsets. Flipkart is not providing refund for this product. They are telling they can replace with same room heater again. Think 100 times before you buy. My 13k gone!!!! Feeling cheated by Flipkart... This will be my last transaction in flipkart. Now only i understood flash sale tricks!!! I dont have option to give zero star.. so giving one..
1|1|Why don't flipkart refund back the amount to customers when customers are not liking their product after receiving it? They have just so many excuses.The brand new phone is heating like a iron but still they have solutions which are not working at all..By doing this they are losing their customer's trust.I have ordered so many things before but never got this problem.I didn't expected this.They themselves know after reading all reviews that the phone is heating then how they can cheat their customers like this.I want my refund.I don't want this phone.They can sell this phone to anyone else as there are many more to buy but what will i doof this phone if its having faults.My money is just wasted if they don't refund me.but they can get the same amount from others who wants to buy. Amazon and snapdeal service is too good in case of returns.they don't even ask a question about it.and here they just keep on calling again and again for reasons. I don't know why they have kept the return button only for those items which cannot be returned.This is cheating with customers.
0|5|Fast,Amazing Camera, Good Battery Life,Light Weight, value for money .....................................................
1|5|nice clearity camera supperb technology just 1 complain that the company does not provide u earphones with the mobile.............
0|1|After having Mi3 i thought of buying this phone but it was my worst mistake. The phone is heating to 42.C while calling, I have requested Customer Care executives to replace my phone or refund the amount, but the answer you get that we can only replace this phone after it reaches 45 C, when I had sent the screen shots that the phone is hitting 44 , they say that temp should reach 50C for replacement. Its better to file a complaint against flipkart in consumer court this time. Worst experince ever
1|4|Very Good in all aspects, the only issue is phone gets heated even with limited use which is a big minus
0|4|At this price its a beast for screen you will fall in love with screen Pros Great screen Great Battery No heating Problem as i am not a gamer Great performance Great interface Great customization Great Camera(beautify is just awesome) Cons Low Speaker Volume Sunlight Display doesnot work easily and flipkart service is degraded it takes them 4-5 days to deliver me this product previously it was 2 days max
0|5|Happy with the phone. Perfect for the price.
0|1|Mi4i totally Fake specification as commited on web site whoso ever is going to buy will suffer like me as there is no budy is technical to handle my situation processor they are commiting 1.7Ghz as device is having 1.6 Ghz and ROM 12.22GB commited but that is 10.2
0|1|Worst After Sales Service not picking phones.. pls don't buy this... i got mi 4.. screen is broken and company not ready to take calls. chandigarh service station guys are not picking calls... and accessory is too costly sunil
0|1|Thanks , but things getting worst with flip-kart customer service executives , this might be my last purchase with flip-kart
1|1|i sold my redmi 3g note coz of this thinking it would be a better choice...Alas!this phone isnt worthy enough..it only looks good ,even in 10 min of use the phone starts getting heated.And this is happening in 1 day of use.I want to get my refund instead of replacement bcoz everyone with this mi 4i is getting this issue!!
0|1|I received the mi 4i product and was shocked to see the internal memory is 10.81 GB after updation of OS of 800mb as provided by Mi site. So 12.77 - .8 gb should work around approximately 12gb. But I have been deceived by the flipkart executive that It would show 12.77 gb after software factory reset. Till now it showed 10.81 Gb. I have been deceived by delivering a wrong product by flipkart. I requested immediate replacement of the product or refund of the money from flipkart. I have lodged a complaint with flipkart. I have not added any apps. The representative from flipkart is not interested in my complaint and he was very specific in ending my call. I called another executive and received a complaint number. I don't think that flipkart would deceive a value added customer.
0|5|I have received this phone on May 4th. Fantastic delivery time I should say. Opened the box found the beauty lying inside it. But this brand new phone is not getting charged beyond 45%. Its definitely a faulty piece I have received. I called customer care talked to Manoj and he told that someone from Technical team will call back still waiting for that call. Despite the phone being connected to the power it charges till 45% and then stay there forever. ********************************************************************************** My phone was replaced by the seller through Flipkart's replacement policy. After using the phone for 3 complete days, I should just say this is an amazing choice. Liked about it : It has got the best of resolution crystal clear display. What an amazing quality of camera, particularly front cam is simply awesome. Speed of the phone and its processing, lightning fast. 4G Sim works and works seamlessly. No lag and no performance issues. Battery backup whooping 2 days in the first use and I am not exaggerating at all. MIUI6 is different and crisp. Disliked about it : Sound is pretty much below average. Xiaomi should definitely get a patch upgrade to improve the same. Wifi disconnects after long time use. At times Wifi needs to be rebooted else it does not detects the signal. Overall a very good phone at this price, for all giving negative reviews I have a gut feeling that they have either not followed the initial steps correctly or simply giving fake reviews to confuse the customers. This is a definite buy and one thing's for sure you don't get such a gem in this price. Let's see how this phone fairs in the longer run but considering Xiaomi's previous performance this phone is definitely going to be a winner and will give satisfaction to most of the customers.
0|1|1.Registered the product before 1 week. 2.Clicked on BUY button on the sale day. 3. Received the parcel,opened the box,charged the mobile. Phone didn't switched on .Again charged, phone got heated but never switched on. Requested for return two days back,till now no response. These phones are not tested properly before releasing into market.
0|1|my ored get canceled bcoz cant deliver in my area my are pin code is accepting but still cnt deliver it so they canceled it without confirming i ask them its ordered so now let me pickup it from courier office near me they refuse it. ans asking me to order again. i called customer care to help let me pickup coz its not easy to order they refuse to help feel like i stay in small village where no transportation in the mobile city like kalyan near thane
0|1|I have got a cracked phone with scratches and right after taking the screen guard off, while the phone was kept idle it cracked again! I have no idea how the gorilla glass has given this any protection. As for the UI lags a little bit. Yes there is a heating problem as well. On the flipkart page it says that gaming should be great, but it lagged on a low end game such as Spiderman Unlimited and subway surfers! Charging time is also very high. This being my first Mi phone, I expected a much better experience. The worst part is that it was given to me as a BIRTHDAY PRESENT! So just think about how bad it would feel to recieve such a phone! I am hoping flipkart replaces this for a new piece. The pros of this phone are: Good looking themes and UI. Nice matte finish and loud speakers.
1|1|This phone just gets heated up while doing any kind of usage whether its picking up calls, surfing, charging, playing game....totally disappointed...
1|1|I shoot an video for about 15 minutes as soon as I switch on the brand new mi4i. Bang!! its temperature around camera increased considerably and it caused great discomfort when it touches ear while answering call. Heating is a very big issue with this phone.
0|1|The phone heats up and back speaker is not working, which is really worry and it is shocking they would delivery a product without testing
0|3|First of all, thanks to Flipkart, the product is delivered much before the promised time and looks awesome in first impressions. MOre specific input after little bit of use. But, am surprised that headset is not part of the standard package which is disappointing.
0|1|This is the worst phone in the world. Today only I received this product, once I switch on the handset,Touch screen itself not working properly. Camera clarity is worst in worst. Don't buy this mobile. For this worst phone I waited for countdown.
1|2|Me and my collegue bought the newly branded mi4i on apr 30 through flipkart, we are very much impressed by the specs and interface of this mobile. But when we switched on the mobile within a few minutes we faced a real heat from the newly bought mi4i, now we face a great heating issue even in a normal usage of this mobile (without opening any game apps), we were very much disappointed by this. Rather than the all the high level specs a mobile should provide a normal usage without any issues but this mobile failed in meeting that. What xiaomi is going to answer for this great disappointment, what will be the solution for this
0|1|I just received Mi 4i. When i took phone out tried to power on it wasn't starting. So plugged in charger , no charging sign was shown in phone & after 30 mins of charging Phone is not starting or charging.
0|1|I was eagerly awaiting for this phone & had high expectation for this phone. Looks,design etc look very exciting. But you use it for 10-15mins at a stretch I.e either call or browse or play game.Device becomes hot on the upper portion of mobile which becomes unusable for next 10-15mins. I think Mi4i is a mobile & not microwave to heat my ear!! Have registered complaint with flipkart on 2nd itself for replacement.They have given some troubleshooting updates to be done.Inspite of doing same its still heating. Flipkart has assured of calling back today i.e their product specialist.. I am waiting for replacement.
1|1|It might be a little early to review this product since I just got the product 5 hours back but it doesn't take someone much time to notice "dead pixels". Yes, the phone delivered by Flipkart is FAULTY. I can see something similar to dead pixels on the display. It's a dirt like patch of the top and is clearly visible with vibrant wallpapers. It's definitely not a scratch or some kind of mark that can be removed and I am sure is a manufacturing defect. Apart from this, Mi 4i has heating issues, call connectivity issues, lag issues and it takes takes ages for the phone to switch on. Didn't get much time to check the camera and sound quality but, with all these issues, I dont expect much. Overall rating should be in negative to Mi and Mi 4i. I have requested for return and hope Flipkart gives me a refund for this Faulty product. (Hope because there was no option of refund but I am sure Flipkart will consider it since the device delivered was faulty).
0|1|I have used other Mi products like Mi3, Redmi1s, mi note 4g and now purchased this one by the attention to details they mentioned during the launch. These are the things i noticed. Over heating issue even in normal usage Battery drains like anything Speaker sound is very very poor I think i got the faulty phone. I am going to request replacement after another one day testing.
0|1|I got the product yesterday and started using immediately. I am fan of MI4 mobiles and waited for long time for MI4I mobile. But I am disappointed with the heating issue. I have used the mobile only for 2-3 calls with the small duration. After the completion of calls I felt the phone became very hot. After the initial observation I strongly feel these phone will become more hot if I use 3G for long duration. I believe Xiaomi still did not resolved the issue. I have already requested to return the product. I strongly request Flipkart to accept my request and return my money.
0|1|i had the worst experience with the order 1) the packing was not proper 2)the phone is getting heated 3)i did make a colour choice 4) no headsets 5)no proper coving / protection to the phone
1|1|Phone is good in design and light weight... Even some lags and heat issue. Heat issue very comman.. Even normal use make it hot. I got mi4i today and the surprise.....!!!!! Speaker not working.... What a jok. Very bad quality control by xiaomi. Dont go for it.... Buy other brand....like asus and lenovo. But not xiaomi. I lost my trust from this brand. This was my first xioami phone. Lg g2 is the best so far android phone i ever used. Flipkart replace the defective product please.
1|2|the left edge of my screen is not responding to touches please tell me what is the solution to this problem

Got it on 2nd May. writing a review with just one day of usage Pros: Very slim, easy to use by one hand Stunning display, Sharp images Never noticed any heating issue, used camera for long time , it was little warm but it was normal I got a white phone, Back panel is not finger print prone for white and black Front camera is really good, it is really a selfie phone. It shows enhanced image. Few features like swipe to select the front/back camera and the filters are very user friendly ( Overall the camera app is pretty good, lot of features.) sunlight visibility is a good feature, it is pretty noticeable The screen is pretty good, it is less finger print prone.  Cons: very low volume - Phone ringing volume is very low call volume in speaker also very low (Normal call volume is good) 13 MP back camera was little low performer when compared with other 13MP cameras ( oneplus ). And other concerns like no expandable memory , no headphone available in the kit which is pretty known.  Couldn’t test LTE/battery life and games performance

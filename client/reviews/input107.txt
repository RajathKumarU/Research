I am using Mi 4i since 2 weeks.  Camera was excellent. Excellent Smartphone with lightweight. Easy to handle the phone. MIUI will give you a pleasant experience. Excellent battery backup. It will last at least 36 hours for light usage.  Initially I face some heating issues on setting he phone. Later I updated it with the latest OTA of 802 MB and did a factory reset, Now there is no heating issue also everything is working fine. It works flawlessly. Now I recommend this to my friends without hesitation.  Please ignore the comments of people who are not aware of how to update the smartphones and please go for it.. A beautiful beast..  Thanks for Xiaomi for excellent smartphone with reasonable price.

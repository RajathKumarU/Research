Using this phone since 4 weeks!!! Marvellous Phone with excellent battery life, excellent camera, excellent volume capabilities and storage. Didn't experience any kind of heating problem even without updating...I am really serious! I was very much disturbed to find the reviews indicating heating problems before buying this...but i have been using it since 4 weeks without that update of 860 MB and still no heating! I have played angry birds, Car races-3D, and even Iron Man-3 and other from google play without any Hanging or heating....!! So just go for it!! Battery needs charging only after 2 days of vigorous using!! I am a satisfied customer.... :-)

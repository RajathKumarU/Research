Been using it for the last one week. Got it in the 1st flash sale. Here are my reviews: Pros: 1. Crisp and bright display. Looks gr8 in sunlight as well 2. Gr8 camera - works perfect in daylight but a bit disappointing in night mode 3. Superb looks - sleek uni body and one hand use makes it feel rich. Cons: 1. MIUI is bit unfriendly for new users.. It will take you some time to get used to it. 2. App crashes made me disappoint - Gallery with Slide show crashed for me once and Data Usage app never launches! 3. Chinese text usage is some widgets and alerts - Learn Chinese before using this phone. I hope the new updates fix some of these. Don't worry about the battery heating - if its running - its got to be sweating! :) All phones have heating issues. This is no different. My brother got an ASUS Zenphone 2 (12999) at the same time and when compared - both gadgets have their good and bad. If you are looking for light weight - one hand use - happy with 16 g internal without an external memory - go for MI4i. If you need big display - better battery (asus has an ultra-saving battery mode that lasts the phone for up to 2 days) - regular android UI experience - go for ASUS

pros: 1. great display 2. good music player subject to good headphones(speaker sound is low) 3. value for money  cons: 1. performance not top notch(being a octa core). there are moments when phone will take a second more to open a app  conclusion: go for it  PS: the phone doesnt heat up much(justifiable) after the latest update.

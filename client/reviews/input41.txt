Well, as many of you might have posted about the 11gb of storage space out of the 16gb, I personally feel that if you know a bit of data management, it will very useful to manage the storage issue. On top of that yiou get a hell lot of space in the cloud to archive your data. The simple option of OTG helps to reduce the pain of carrying heavy and bulky files on the device.  Using the device for roughly 3 days has given me a fair amout of idea about the basic features and the MIUI has helped me customise the device according to my needs. The phone has not yet got a charge post a full charge day before yesterday. I am still having about 46% juice left at this point of time when I am typing the review. Camera is superb, both the selfie and the rear! The new feature of sunlight display really works when using the device outdoors.  Overall a great device with a great battery and superb processor speeds. I am not a gaming person, so I do not have complints from the heating perspective.  PROS: camera battery life processor MIUI android lollipop sound reproduction  CONS: didnot notice any yet!

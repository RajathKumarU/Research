I was using Windows phone (Lumia 720) for almost one and half years. Entering into Android platform with this awesome machine is truly an amazing experience. One'll get all the features of a flagship phone ( Be it Samsung, HTC or any other so called "branded" phone). Shedding extra bucks for "brand" is absolutely a waste and I was no exception to this brand phobia until my eyes were opened, thanks to my friends and colleagues who gave honest reviews about these line of phones they owned (Honor, MI, Asus among many)  Coming to the negative reviews that were posted here, I can only say- Please be mindful about the money you are spending for the specs given and also note that playing HD games is unfortunately not the function of a smart phone. You have different set of machines to do that. Please don't spoil the ratings (which can deceive a normal user's perception about this awesome phone)

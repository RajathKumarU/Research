Final Verdict: Go for it !!!!  First thought: I'm writing this review after using Mi4i for 2 days. After unboxing, the first thing that caught my attention were the build quality, ergonomic feel and light weightiness of the device.  What a display: The display is exceptionally good and smooth to touch. The colors and resolution is amazing at this price point.  Although, i haven't tried any high performance games yet, there are no lags or performance failure.  Heating??? Nah, just warming up for normal people like me!! Felt warm initially, but after updating the software (to MIUI 6.5.3.0), it hasn't felt any warmer than any other device people are using these days. If you put pressure on the processor, which smartphone would stay cool? Please don't ask for a BMW at the price of a Honda City.  The battery does hold up for a day and a half at normal usage. All in all, i would recommend this phone to anyone thinking to go to the next step from below 10k devices. The device you're getting is worth every penny!

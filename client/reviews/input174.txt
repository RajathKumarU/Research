i writing this after 24 hrs of usage. cons: memory only 10.5gb available UI is not so great There is some lagging noticeable takes a lot of time to wake up (screen to switch on)when pressed power button button quality i didn't like 1gb available ram only white available in flash sale(this white doesn't give rich look). Think of all alternatives before you buy , since its not a Steal like that of Mi3. There are some pro's Display is cool heat is very less(I don't understand why so many people have heating problem. ) camera is good. back panel quality is good very light perfect size

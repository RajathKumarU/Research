Good specs!! looks stunning in white. Just got it today and can't expect much for what i spent on. It lags a bit after the Mi update. Mi should work on that and overall view is -- good phone. Don't expect much durability from this mobile, it looks like a snow white in a glass box and looks soo sensitive, buying a cover and guard would do the job but the problem is lagging after the update. i can tell Mi is working hard to make a mark but have to do a little bit more to get to the top. Screen is great, sound don't expect beats audio, didn't play any games yet, but i can say i don't care cause i don't play games on mobile, battery is great for now backup is 24hrs or even more if i use it for a little browsing, facebook, whatsapp, and some social apps and it depends completely on me about how well i maintain it can't and don't blame Mi or any such companies if u cant maintain your mobile battery.

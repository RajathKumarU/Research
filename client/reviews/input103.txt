Has anybody received an 800MB+ update to MIUI?? I applied the update as soon as unboxing the Mobile.  The mobile then went into a Reboot over-drive. It started rebooting every now and then while its opening Whatsapp or Camera usage or Settings menu etc. Have to call and file for a exchange.  Did anyone else face a similar issue? Do report it here.  The mobile is nice by the way. For the price this is easily the best compact 5inch mobile u can buy with acceptable performance, camera and battery life.

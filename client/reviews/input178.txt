MiUi again ruined another amazing phone Xiaomi launched! It looks like Xiaomi is not willing to mend it's generic UI issues which spoils every model they launch even today. Cons:- 1 - LAGGY and SLUGGISH user interface. There is a noticeable lag in everything you operate, right from performing basic tasks to opening new apps. 2 - Basic apps close down while multi-tasking. 3 - Only around 750Mb of RAM available! I don't understand what is the use of purchasing a phone with 2Gb of RAM when all of it is consumed by the system itself! This implies that how much you spend and upgrade the hardware, it is of no use if you have such an inefficient software. 4 - Rear speaker volume tooooo lowwww! I think Hugo Barra saved a million by providing such useless speakers! Forget about listening music, get ready to miss most of your calls in the slightest of a noisy environment. 5 - MiUi is obsessed with apple and iOS till date. Grow up! Pros:- 1 - Great camera (Both) and dual tone flash. 2 - Nice Full HD display. 3 - Good battery backup. 4 - Good looks and design. Slim phone with thin bezels.

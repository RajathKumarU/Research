There were two reasons I ordered the phone, the promising 13MP camera and the FullHD display and man am I impressed. The camera is top notch in every way, be it picture quality or other features! It even has a manual mode! The flash works pretty well, giving out the same results that a DSLR would give in low light. Without the flash, though, there is quite a bit of noise which can be compromised with. The selfie camera is also very good, the pictures are comparable to those from iPhone. The display is brilliantly crafted as well. Perfect colors, size and lighting. To add to these, the battery is quite long lasting, the body is slim and sleek, the sound quality is good (speaker isnt too loud, but very clear), and the UI is beautiful (takes one day to get around, but you'll love it). To sum it up, you cannot get a more sophisticated, value for money device for this price. Cheers Xiaomi. Waiting for my freebie screen guard!

Bought this phone for my wife during the Flipkart Season Sale under Exchange and Cashback offers.  Xiaomi Mi 4i is a phone very high on Specs and Features. Ideal buy at the price point it is available.  Major Drawback is no support for additional SD Card. The memory available is only around 12 GB.  Also you can feel the lag even if it has the latest MIUI6 based on Lollipop 5.0.2 after continuous use of around a month.  This phone is Ideal for people who do not have too heavy usage of the phones and hence do not load too many apps on the phone.

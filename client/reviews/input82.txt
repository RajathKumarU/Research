Pros 1.No heat issue at all. I have downloaded much heavier games and played them along many applications running simultaneously. No lag whatsoever. 2. Camera quality is brilliant(both front and rear). As compare to Moto G(3rd gen) it is superior. 3. Battery backup it moderate. 4. Display is absolutely magnificent. Full HD makes a perfect display. 5. Lightweight. Again thumbs up!!!  Cons 1. MIUI eats up too much RAM. Even after having 2GB of RAM it always occupies more than 50%. But there is no lag in application loading or switching between them.

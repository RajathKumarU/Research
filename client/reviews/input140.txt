I got this phone on first sale Apr 29th . Got delivered on May 2nd Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Pros : 1) Very good display. Crystal clear. Readability in sunlight also good 2) Screen response is very good 3) Front and rear camera is good 4) Handling high end applications/games without lag at most of the time 5) Good sound o/p when we listen songs in earphones/headphones is good. 6) Phone built is very good. Phone looks sturdy and stylish 7) Battery is good for Avg use. Cons: 1) No external memory card - Big minus. When we have HD recording, which fills memory at rapid speed, support to ext mem card is very much needed 2) External speaker sound is very much low. At times not able to hear ringtons as well. 3) Hangs sometime when we launch multiple apps 4) Initially phone was heating up more. After upgrading to latest version, this is much better now

Hello guys  This is the perfect phone in 5 inch display in this price range. Having an awesome display with performance, battery life, smooth touch and with a nice camera, you cant get more than this in this price. Yes, it heats a bit if you are a heavy user but not too much and its bearable for what you are getting for 13K. The game play and calls were also smooth.  Altogether an awesome phone. Go for it...

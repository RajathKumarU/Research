I had ordered the phone in the first flash sale itself.Then after reading so many negative reviews i cancelled my phone and started hunting for a new phone.My options was SG S4, and iphone 5C and zenfone 2. My requirements were-  5 inch mobile.(Its the best for one hand operation) Good pixel density screen Good processor/Good graphics processor Good camera(Both primary and secondary)  Set back for the SG S4 was the phone was very slow after the lollipop update and the battery charge was also affected drastically.Max you will get 7-8 hours which is not tolerable.Moreover this flagship model was released in 2013 and got 32 bit processor.I considered this because amazon was giving this phone for 16k.  Opted out Iphone 5c 8gb because of very less storage space after the ios 8.3 up gradation.You will get only 3.5 gb user space.But there was no report of lags or whatsoever in this phone after updated to latest version.You can consider this one if are ok with limited 3.5gb user space and want to experience the ios.Cosk under 20K.  Zenfone 2 (2 gig) is the best competitor for Mi4i.Almost the same performance and screen quality but there are some bugs reported which makes phonecalls dropping/voice quality etc(This may be rectified soon with some OTA udpate).The camera is not as good as Mi4i.Intel processor are notorious for the power consumption.It can hardly last a day.  Everyday i am spending some time to read the reviews of above said phones and i came to know that the major cons of the mi4i heating problem is resolved by an update from Xiaomi,so took a chance and brought it. Intial impression about this phone was very bad because the phone started to heat up when i kept it for charging and then i made a call to test its voice quality and it was heating like anything and you cannot put it on ears,that much heat.Then i updated the phone (860MB) and phone really cools down.Now i am not experiencing any heat while charging.But there is some amount of heat developing during call which is tolerable. So my advice is to the prospective buyers please update and use the phone.

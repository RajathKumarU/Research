a v.good piece for this price tag, ill give my ratings as follows out of 5.. model/design: 4/5 screen: 4.5/5 camera: 3/5 ui: 4/5 battery backup :4/5 coming to ram it has 2 gb in which the whole 1 gb is used for pre installed apps well we can uninstall them tough. processor speed is good, well according to the price. we cant expect speed as compared to 2+ghz devices. for the first time when i turned on the device got heated up within moments but after that its normal not much heating update the software there is a software available. am pretty disappointed when i opened the box no headset no otg cable, jus device and charger that's all very disappointing... my overall score for this device is 3/5. i would have given at-least 4.5 if other accessories were given.

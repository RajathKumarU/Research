I had ordered for Mi4i White before the Grey one was available. The very day after ordering I saw that Grey is coming for sale next week, so I canceled and waited to buy the grey one and eventually I purchased it last Thursday and got it delivered on Friday morning..I am so happy that I waited for the grey one..  This phone is fantabulous for the price that it comes for..My office colleagues who own Mi3 and Mi4 liked the design of Mi4i compared to their handsets..It's smaller and handier in size and has a very sleek design..Talk about performance, it just rocks..I played Asphalt the same day and it runs very smoothly..I also tested the cameras and recorded a full HD video using the front cam..just brilliant! Battery life is super cool..I charge it to 100% in the morning and by the time I come home in the evening, the battery still remains at 70% or higher with normal usage throughout the day..  The handset I got, comes with the latest MIUI 6 and I did not experience any heating problems even after testing it with heavy usage while accessing multiple apps, calls and even with heavy gaming...for people who need more storage space, this could be the only constraint..for me 16 GB is just fine..I could never exhaust 16 GB in my old phone including internal and external memory..  So, in a nutshell, here are the pros and cons:  Pros:  1. Great pricing for the phone specs 2. Great design, look and feel + very handy 3. Lag free top end performance 4. Amazing display and camera quality 5. Great battery life 6. 4G support  Cons: 1. Fixed storage space of 16 GB (Concern for only those who need heavy storage in the phone)

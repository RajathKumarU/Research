I purchased it since two months.its time for review. mi4i is pretty good mid range mobile. Experience: delivery was prompt and for each booting it took a little time. it was heating until i applied the update i have received.then all problems come to an end. since now i received three lollipop update from mi. IRON BOX?? no it is not an iron box.don't worry.the latest software updates have solved all problems, but if you play a hd game for 4 hours it will get heat. using WiFi for long time doesn't even burn it. but WiFi direct for a couple of hours will definitely heat t up as all smart phones do. GAMING: it runs almost all hd games smoothly.if it gives lag, just turn on performance mode and play.even ios cant beat it on performance mode. CAMERA: Its an awesome camera.You can expect a semi SLR quality images.night photos are pretty impressive. but video recording Quality varies from device to device. Cons: non expandable memory: purchase an usb/otg storage to solve this slippery matte finish back.so get a cover soon. Heating: The sfw update will fix it in seconds.

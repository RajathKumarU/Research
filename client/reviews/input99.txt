1. Its been a week now and the phone is smooth like butter. 2. I am a MI fan and this phone has fulfilled my expectations. 3. It is worth the money. 4. No heating issues.(I found none, anyways laptops also heat). 5. Fully charge lasts for one whole day with regular use.   1. Awesome look and feel 2. Camera is also powerful 3. I am happy to have this product. Its so thin that gives it sexy look and front camera is awesome. Processor is also feels good when i used to play games. Only one drawback is You need to buy earphones externally,because no headset along with this.

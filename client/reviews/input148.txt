Thanks for Flipkart and Xiaomi... for this great phone but i have raised the replacement request B'coz...of  my screen panel and outer edge not fitted perfectly.. their is a gap like hire crack size... i am worried how to secure my phone from dust and water... and i observed when navigation keys on...and lights...come outside the phone from bottom frame... Hope Flipkart helping me in this issue... and resolve my issue... I am user of REDMI 1s , Redmi 2 and now MI4I..

I ordered Mi 4i white, from flipkart app on October 29th and after finishing transaction, got sms that it will be delivered on 6th of Nov. But they delivered it within 3 days and whenever I tracked the package in app, it showed me where exactly it is being shipped from, where is it now etc. Good that flipkart is so transparent. OK, about the phone, it is very cool looking. Very light weight. Lots of features. As I was having a Windows phone before, need to take time for operating android. White colour is really very charming but flipkart didn't make blue available as it is my fav colour. I think flipkart should make all colour variants avbl. Overall good experience with Mi 4i. Slight heating problem. If I use for more than 10 mins, phone heats up a bit. Few features r still in experimental mode. Lock screen display font colour can't be changed. This makes me unable to set wallpapers that have white. Also the back button "<" doesn't activate in 1 touch. Need to press it 3-4 times. But all other features r pretty cool. Worth for âÂÂ?¹8999 as I got extra 10% discount using standard charter card. I recommend this phone and I liked it.

Its been a day since i had received my Mi4i  Ive used Ines, Lumia series mobiles, Sony Xperia mobiles and samsung mobiles I am a normal user (lots of music, videos, chatting, surfing , productivity apps, wifi or 3g 24/7, non heavy game user)  First things first Make an OTA update of 800MBs for performance improvements  i feel the phone is best suiting my requirements. Design is really good (light weight almost wafer like) Display is a great plus No heating for my use, unless using the phone while charging Charges full in 150 mins Charge stands for 24 hrs with either wifi or 3g on around 10 or more hours of mobile usage (music, videos, chatting, browing n stuff) 900MBs of RAM more than suffices as Ive loaded with lots of Apps (downloaded and preloaded) and phone doesnt hang a bit  for 13K this phone is a monster !! I would recommend for anyone who wants very good phone at a decent budget  Go for it !

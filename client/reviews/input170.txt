Very good product except camera pixel resolution. It is not actual 13 mp cam. but color and other options are great. Low light photography without flash is too grainy. Other than this, it is a great product. Also try to buy 32 GB version since 16 GB is not enough to store videos. Great display, great responsive touch and no heating issue after software update.Sound is also loud and clear. Good battery back up. Good phone!!

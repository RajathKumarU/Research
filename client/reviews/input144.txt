I had bought the Mi 4i in the first flash sale only and was amazed to see the display quality and camera performance. But after some days, while using the mobile in dark, I noticed a little illuminated line below the BACK and HOME LED buttons. This is a minor manufacturing defect so i opted for a replacement. I got another device immediately after 2 days. I was happy to see a quick response from flipkart but upon receiving replacement I found a similar issue in the device. So again I requested for replacement. The request is still pending but I want to suggest Xiomi and Flipkart to do some quality check before sale. Such an awesome product like Mi 4i is getting blamed just for such minor issue. Hope they will come with a quality product next time.

I am not a big techie, heard a lot about Xiaomi MI devices, decided to go for it. As of now, I am happy with the device. I will talk about two things which users are complaining about whereas the rest of things are flawless.  1. Heating :Slight heating issues but every other smartphone running on high specs have this issue. As the performance increases the load on the processor increases, it is simple as that. Xiaomi service says the phone temperature should not go beyong 50 degrees and as of now it hasn't.  2. Battery : Awesome!! I downloaded loads of apps , installation , played angry birds. Still delivers. I am not a high end gamer so can't comment on that end.  And ya don't forget to update the phone as soon as you receive it or else you shall be sitting in the complain panel ;)

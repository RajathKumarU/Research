I have ordered this product from my friends account since there was a flash sale in the start. Having used this phone from past 3 months or probably more than that my conclusion is this phone is superb .Better than any so called branded phones.Heats up very little which is common in any snapdragon processor but neglibile,camera is awesome,front camera is excellent because of beautiy software, miui 6.5.6 User interface is quick,display is superb ,though a lag caused by 2gb ram when play 2k videos ,2k and above format requires 3 gb ram so thats fine .All in all if you compare battery ,display ,camera ,built quality,price ,looks ,software i give high five....Only suggestion to flipkart or Xiaomi is please stop this nonsense flash sale if this is marketting gimmick it is fine but have all the colors and provide sale and reachout to all people in one go....there is a chance that people will be fed of the duration of registration and may move on to other brands ,Since Xiaomi is awesome Brand i dont think they require any gimmicks .

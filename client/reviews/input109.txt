Well, this is an edit over my previous review. I received the product on 5th May, 2015 & using it since. And I was very angry at that time because the phone has no native video calling option. Later, I found that from Android KitKat 4.4.4, native video calling option was removed from Android. So here's my honest review about the product.  Phone is good, light weight, great display, good amount of RAM, good front camera, battery charges quick & lasts more than 1 day.  Phone is bad, it gets warm, but that's not called heating. No expandable memory option, tried lots of OTG thumb drives, but doesn't support all, rear camera is not up to the mark.  After purchasing the phone, I went through online reviews & comparisons of this phone to other phones with same configuration, & found that this is the best phone amongst them in almost every department. Maybe in a few weeks, there might be a winner over Mi 4i. But till then, why not enjoy the moment?  And please do update your phone's firmware. I did myself & found lot of performance & heating issue resolved over these updates. Current updated firmware version is 6.5.6.0, & my phone doesn't even get warm like it used to.  Hope I might able to help you taking decision over buying this phone with this review.  Thank you.

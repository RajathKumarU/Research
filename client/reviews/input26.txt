Writing this review after 3 days of use. First of all coming to the body design : awesome is the word for it very sleek design smooth matte finish at the back and front full black. Next talking about the display : yes full hd it is 441ppi excellent display bt in sunlight the sunlight display feature of this phone dosent work very well does help tho. reading in sunlight is above average i can say. Coming to the most talked Camera of mi 4i : Believe me you wont regret buying this phone if you buy it for camera purpose. one of the best camera i have come across .FRont and rear work extremely well in good light conditions in low light gives some grains bt that is with all the midrange devices. can compare the picture quality with that of all high end samsung phones and iphone 5s . Battery : this is the part where it dissapoints a little tho it is 3100 apprx mA battery it dosent last more than a working day if u use wifi and browse for say 3 - 4 hrs.if u use it mediocarly it can last more than a day so not for gamers. performance : it is good i can say supports high graphic games like asphalt8 and many more. There are some rumors on in the market that this phone heats up and it is a big problem n shit believe there is literally nothing like that infact phone is cool fir most of the time except when u play games. lastly thank u flipkart for really fast delivery..!!!! hope this review helps you. neglecting the battery problem ill give 5 stars.

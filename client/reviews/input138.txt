Firstly, kudos to Flipkart for delivering the product within 2 days time. Appreciate this kind of super fast delivery services.  Coming to the product, the overall appearance of the phone is strikingly attractive, slim and neat and above all extremely light. And the best part is one need not open the phone to slide in the sim card or fiddle with the batteries, the advantage being the battery is inbuilt.  The camera of the phone is just fantastic. the images with the front camera 5MP are pretty good. Truly happy with the picture qualities.  The phone has a call recording system too, that impresses me and it comes quite handy to me at my workplace.  Some cons: You dont have an option to expand its memory. The phone comes with an inbuilt 16 GB memory out of which almost 60% is used up by the phone applications.

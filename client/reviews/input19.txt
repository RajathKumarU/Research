I was losing interest in Androids and was looking forward to buy an iPhone 6, but after going through the reviews I felt of giving Mi4i a shot. And I think it is one of the best decision I have made in my life. Save me a lot of bucks and with the new miui 7 upgrade its super smooth and it has brought my lost love for androids back. Mark my words Xiaomi is going to kill Apple in years to come. What quality. Pros 1) The best feature is the screen, iPhone or any other Smartphones can't match the quality, it's out of the world.  2) The 13 MP Camera is outstanding, we get rich colours with great accuracy. 3) The interface is buttery smooth and I am in love with it. Any iOS migrant would love it. 4) The gaming performance is extremely smooth. Cons None...But if they could provide a Screen Protector in the box it would've been even more awesome. Go for it Strongly recommended !!!

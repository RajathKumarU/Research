Hi Buddies ...!  To Be an honest writer, i reviewed about the overall stuffs about " Mi 4i". Lets enjoy it. I've rated on the various aspects of the gadget  1) STYLE: Slim & Handy. Just like the IPhone 6. Since it is 5'' screen it is best to hold and to be fit our pocket. And i advice go for a coloured one, ratther than buying classic white. Because of its pure attire, dirt and stains are easily visible on the first day itself.  2) CAMERA: To be decent, the camera was better (not the best). Because i was an HTC lover, i used various HTC handsets (Desire X, One, M8), where there autofocus and richness was unmatchable with this. Rear camera is good, but it doesnt give any pucca focussing effect, even when tap. Front was pretty good ( as we cant afford more with 5MP).  3) PERFORMANCE: Performance for techies means Gaming....!! Its gives smooth play with most of the High End games like Asphalt 8-Airborne , Nova , GTA series...etc.,  Like our other reviewers, it gets hot while playing. Its not an big issue. NO ONE CAN MENTION A SMARTPHONE NAME WITHOUT HEATING, DURING HIGH PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES.  4) BATTERY: To be decent, Mi 4i has a poor battery backup. It can withstand 8-10 hours on the basic usage. One good thing is that , it has FAST CHARGING facility. Good for today's busy work.  5) '''''NO HEATING ISSUE''''' : I swear there is no heating issue on this phone. And MIUI provides an UI update of MIUI v 6.7.0. It was good to experience Mi without heating issue. If so ur heart feels, buy a cover.  6) SOUND QUALITY : Average sound quality. Doesn't provide a headset. Need to spend extra bucks for that bullshit. Has a equalizer and headphone options for user comfort.  THE FINAL VERDICT  It was awesome phone for the price, good deisgn, better picture, sleek design, average battery backup.

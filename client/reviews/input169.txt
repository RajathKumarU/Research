I am using this MI4I phone from last 3 months. I think this is sufficient time to understand completely to judge the phone performance. Pros: 1. The performance of the phone is too good. 2. I never seen hanging problem so far for this phone 3. Video recording HD quality is too good 4. Very flexible to handle this phone in single hand as it is 5 inches 5. Battery backup is good. But when internet connected the backup is down.  Cons: Prise can be reduced as when compared with other company similar mobiles

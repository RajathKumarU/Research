First of all, This is my 3rd Mi mobile. Configuration- Good- People say it is average as they compare it with high end mobile, Ofcourse you will get good config if you send more money Heating problem- Remember, Phone is a phone- it is neither a SLR camera nor XBox. Let expert do its work. there is no substitute for one another. Would you feel the same confort of the car in BMW bike of the same cost, not for sure the reason is both are meant for a different purpose. same is the case with phone. If you need 3 hour gaming and do not want your phone to heat then go buy XBOX :) Battery- no complaints- as they claim 40% in one hour- Thats pretty fair. Mi Ui is awsum Micromax has long way to catch up with Mi, unless they come up with something innovative.  all and all- very good mobile under this price band and definitely a good compition to Sony and samsung.

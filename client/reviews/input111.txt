I have been using the phone for 2 days (and almost non stop, as you guys know hows with a new gadget, installing apps and exploring) It's not getting more warm than any other smartphone out there. Every smartphone gets a little warm on moderate to heavy use; as simple as that. I have been facing issues with the Onedrive app, i.e. files won't open. It constantly shows no network connection. Thats just for this one app. Apart from that the phone works good as expected (Its not iPhone 6 or Galaxy 6). Personally I prefer Google Now Launcher over the standard launchers of each manufacturer. Camera is very good, not great (I was using Lumia 920 earlier, am missing the camera already).

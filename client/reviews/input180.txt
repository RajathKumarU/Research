I got this phone few days back and was excited to experience an affordable beast. With a single day use I was fully satisfied with the performance until I turned on the Primary Camera to shoot some pictures and videos. The camera is average quality but the biggest issue is the camera software, it has the "Slow Motion" feature to capture and view the recorded video in slow motion. But it has bugs and most of the times you will get a black screen or blinking black/white screen while using this feature. I immediately reported this to flipkart and they arranged a replacement. But I don't think a replacement will work because the other Mi 4i phone my brother-in-law received has exactly the same issue making me believe that the whole lot is defective.  I hope Xiami fixes this issue by pushing a software update ASAP.  i will give 5 stars to this product if the camera issue is fixed.

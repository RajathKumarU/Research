Using since 1 week. Pros: 1.Slim & light weight 2.Very good front camera 3.Battery lasts for a day 4.Good call quality 5.Excellent display Cons: 1.Even after update, heating issue above normal level - while charging, playing games, camera on etc. 2.Power button too sharp, noisy, poor quality. We can even identify Mi4i user by his damaged finger tips after few weeks of usage!! 3.Wi-fi not getting connected - forcing me to use mobile data only 4.Rear camera seems to have samsung sensor & pictures are of 8 MP only - Zooming cause noisy images; camera protrudes out in upper part 5.Speaker volume very low - have to place rear side up to be audible - otherwise ring tone may be missed. 6.Phone lags during playing subway surfer. 7.Poor RAM management - only 700 MB available for usage even after clearing cache 8.No colour flipcovers available at MI.COM 9.UI not so smooth as expected - hangs occasionally. 10.Too Tight chager port. I wonder how they missed pathetic sharp buttons, rear camera protrusion, low speaker output & abnormal heating etc. - shows their quality contol. To conclude, not fully satisfied & I have the doubt whether it lasts for atleast 1 year.

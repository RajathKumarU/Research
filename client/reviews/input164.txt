There will be issues with any phone that we buy. Regardless of good features that are preset in every phone, I need to mention the bad in this phone.  1) Heating issue: The phone started emitting heat within the first few minutes after i on the phone. If I leave the phone without using, I can feel less heat. Using too many apps or internet may burn your hands.  2) process com.google.process.gapps stooped working: I experienced this error after i entered into PlayStore and the error didn't got stopped whatever i did in my phone. It continued to blink on the screen until I opt to reset my phone. After resetting the phone, the error has been stopped. As it was a new phone, I decided to reset. It doestn't seems to occur in every phone  These are the major issues in this phone. All the other features are very fine.  UI of the phone is very attractive. No software issues. Camera is good.  If you can bare the heat, this phone can make you feel happy.

Brilliant Display, Excellent UI, Nice sound, Slim and light - are some of the features of this phone. Its been a week since I bought this phone and haven't faced any issues so far. The phone responds really well and doesn't feel like a low priced one. The heating issue that everyone are complaining about doesn't occur after the update (800 mb).

This review questions the aggressiveness shown by Xiaomi and Flipkart to sell Mi4i without Beta testing the phone.  Initially I was sceptical about buying this phone after reading the reviews but could not find any other phone with similar specs and price, so finally purchased Grey on June 24. The phone had all issues mentioned in the reviews like heating, battery draining even without any use. I used to dread taking this phone outstation as battery will die out anytime if not charged twice in a day. The rear camera also freezed once while attending an important function, missed all those beautiful moments.  Finally I requested return which obviously Flipkart refused on flimsy grounds. But thankfully to my utter surprise after July 24 update the phone became a GEM. No or little heating, The battery has also lasted for 36 hrs. without recharge and still going.  So the question arises that if hardware issues could have been resolved by ROM update then why were Xiaomi and Flipkart were in such a big hurry to sell this phone without going for vigorous testing.........  Hope the phone behaves as above in future...........

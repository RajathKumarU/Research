I will write only the negative points, apart from that everything else is good  1. Heating problem while charging, internet surfing and long duration calls 2. Low volume of ringtone, Vibration quality is also poor. you won't be able to sense the phone is ringing if you are at noisy area. 3. Auto key operation even in lock screen. Many times the phone started music and other operations while kept in pocket. tried every options still the problem exists. 4.Scratch resistance is very poor, i recommend you to buy a screen guard along with this phone.  Still i recommend this phone. But think about your need based upon the four points i mentioned before buying..

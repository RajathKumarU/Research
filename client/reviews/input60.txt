- Received it yesterday - 4th May evening. - Brilliant screen clarity and touch. - Very light to hold. - Does look like a premium phone. - No issues with Camera - front & back. - Loud speaker is crisp and loud. Not louder than an iPhone 5s & above. - Does heat a little on surfing/ whatsapp calling, which phone doesn't. - MIUI6 is highly flexible. Lollipop features are not visible in OS. - Clear voice calls/ reception. - Matt White back panel. Will not slip from hand.  My 2 cents is to go for it as the HW configuration offered at this price is worth the price.

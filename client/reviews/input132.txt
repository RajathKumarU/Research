I have been using Mi 4i grey product from last 2 weeks. Pros: 1. Its very handy and look premium in the hand. 2. Super clarity, worth a buy and sunlight display works when exposed to sunlight. Many of my old devices had a problem in viewing during sunny day outside. 3. OTG supported. 4. Big plus is 4G, i could download 10mb in 4 secs. Super fast with Airtel 4G.  Cons: 1. Average battery backup. It didn't looked to me as a 3100mh battery as it lasts only for one day. 2. Gets bit of heating during charging and while gaming or on heavy usage. It came around 42 degree. 3. Non expandable memory, user will have approx. 10GB od space. 4. Not satisfied with image quality. Still images looks good but when clicked against moving objects it takes pathetic pictures. 5. Do not use without hard cases, since it looked to me delicate.  Overall it looked to me good, in spite of many negatives. You can definitely worth a try. Not happy with Flipkart delivering the product. It took me almost a week to get this delivered.

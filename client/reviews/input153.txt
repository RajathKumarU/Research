I`ve used so many android phones but so far this is the best one I could find.. The more I`m using it the more I`m loving it... ya there is lil bit issue of heating while charging but that no an big issue rest everyting is amazing at this price segment, amazing camers, processor etc... but one thing I must say if company ppl read this that company should provide atleat a screen guard since its a new model & no screen guard is available in the market...no ear phone even in the box...but thx for providing such an amazing phone at this price...

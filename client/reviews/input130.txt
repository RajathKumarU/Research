i purchased this phone on july 3rd, i have been using this phone for since then.Couple of days before i noticed a green mark in my screen.now i have requested for a replacement and going to get my replacement in next day.Apart from that i found this phone really great.First of all display and camera they booth are really the greatest that you can get it in this price range.for this prize the display quality was out of the world.Both the front and back cameras excel in taking photos in low light &out door.Video quality was ok.i did not face a heating problem till now,yes iam a moderate user &the phone heats up when you use it for browsing internet for long time.But it was never like i can't handle the phone situation i just felt a warm feeling anything as a huge problem.the battery performance is also good it lasts a day easily(12hrs)may be 20 hrs....but for 3000+ mah battery i dont think it is enough(when you use it for constant gaming and browsing it will last only up to 5-8hrs). Miui 6 is great it gives the user chance to customise your device completely.if u need a stock android experiance you can easily use google now launcher.snapdragon 615 is a good option but the phone is sluggish sometimes.that will force you to restart your device at least once in couple of days so that the device starts working smoothly........if you are looking for a phone for day to day use you can complete for this device it is totally worth it

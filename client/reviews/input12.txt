Few days back on 15 july i order this phone. the phone i received was heating so much that one can iron the clothes with that i contact flipkart they said update it... i do... then the issue was not solved... last week i request for replacement nd flipkart rejected my request. I again try then after a lot of talk they replace the phone. Now the main twist... the replacement i got is a Mi4i in which the touch screen is not working... when i complaint they said call later... again i try they again assign a call for today i.e 6 august 15. The customer care disconnect the call nd message me tht they will call me tomorrow.... Flipkart Just passing the time so tht 30 days just fly away... nd i left with a damaged phone.  I m very disappointed with this behaviour. I thought Flipkart is good. but i was completely wrong.. Recently purchased 4 phones from flipkart to gift my family... But now i will never recommend flipkart to anyone. Shame on u flipkart. I dnt want to use that phone anymore. Plz refund my money.  I am rating 5 star for the brilliant Idea of cheating the customers. Brilluiant job Flipkart for fooling customers.

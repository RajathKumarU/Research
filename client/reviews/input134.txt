I bought grey color phone in flash sale.Wow what a design, I am not able to let my eyes away from this, Superb superb design.I don't know how xiaomi built this slim beauty in this cost.Display, you cannot find any mobile in this price range(not even 20k range) to compare with this.Coming to built quality,you can hit and kill anyone with this without getting damaged,that strong it is,credit goes to xiaomi.(very less weight) Coming to camera, i am satisfied with both the cameras for pics,but video should be some what better. Coming to performance, I am able to play alphat 8(high end game) with out any lag. Coming to heat, yes, i can fell some heat at upper part, but not that much. Coming to battery,it is good. Bad part is, it comes with only 16 gb(hardly 10 gb usable) internal memory and not possible to expand it and no head set .  My suggestion is to take it and feel the beauty.(you will never get disappointed in design and quality)

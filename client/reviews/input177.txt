yes , the phone is really good to hold, good display, and really good cam.Really good selfie cam and rear cam is also good.  but , heats up while charging the phone , when camera app is on and while playing games. and no expandable memory and lags while loading some apps like wechat and some other apps, dont know the reason. moto g 1st gen loads the same version of wechat much faster.  You get 901 Mb of ram available when no app is running , ie the os itself takes 1 gb of ram. which is sufficient for normal users.  Dont understand this octa core thing, it eats up battery , heats up alot and gives much lower perfomance . They could have used a Snapdragon 801 instread which would have been better.

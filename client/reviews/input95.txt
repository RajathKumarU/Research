after a long comparison i opted to go for this. the camera qualities are very good, especially the front camera (5 mp)....very sensitive touch screen, good sound and has an exceptionally good display....but did not observe the overheating problem during multitasking even after running the apps for a very long time...u can play subway surfer, clash of clans, Asphalt 8 also .... after playing the subway surfer for 30 mins while charging the temperature was 38 C, which was OK.....update the system and experienced the awesome Mi 4i

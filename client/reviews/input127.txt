I had bought Mi 4i during flash sale in May and am writing this review after 2 months of usage. * no heating issues...i had updated the firmware soon after buying and probably that helps * battery is quite good...though it doesn't last 2 full days even on battery saving 2G signal...if u put on 3G then its just more than 1 day...if u select 4G then just 1 day!! * screen resolution is awesome...adjusts screen brightness automatically in sunlight or low light * very light weight and finishing is sleek * 2 GB RAM....sadly the available is around 1 GB only for installing apps as rest all used by Android or default apps * both front and rear cameras are great...very minimal shutter lag compared to any other phone in this price range..nice flash also....however, it lacks various shooting modes which are common in an average phone also nowadays...so thats a dampener * Performance is great...multi-tasking is smooth due to the octa-core processor * MI UI is good but didnt feel great...overall I did not find Lollipop as an improvement over kit kat * no earphone provided...thats a downer for such a high-end phone...the sound is low for media, ringtone or speaker but good enough for regular phone usage  To summarize, you simply cannot get a high-end and fully loaded smartphone with these features at this price...and so just go for it...unless you want everything perfect in which case you need to spend 35k for experia Z3 which is the next best thing!!

Excellent OS and camera both front and back. Don't Dont feel like carrying a mobile such a light weight. Awesome design. Looks stilish. One con's is no expandable memory. Heating is also bearable that's common in today's smart phones.  Just go for it you will be very delighted and don't just miss such an unbeatable phone just because of little heating problem

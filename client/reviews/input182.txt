After using 6 days, I am writing this review. First thing is,there is no expandable memory option. SO before purchasing you decide about memory requirement for you. only 10.81 GB available for the users. Pros: Build quality is good...  Front camera is good... Awesome Display ...  Cons: Rear Camera not good as expected... I am not feeling like Battery is 3140Mah. With normal usage We can manage one day. I have seen only 1GB free Ram available. .. Bit Heating Issue....  I felt very bad for this : Flipkart not accepting return. I applied for return within 24hours of product received. Dear flipkart please accept the return request from the customers. If the customer not satisfied with the product what can he do with that product.? You people not working for customer satisfaction. Snapdeal will refund the amount if customer is not satisfied with the product.

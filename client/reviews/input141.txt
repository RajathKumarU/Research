Excellent service by flipkart. Booked Mi4i on Monday afternoon, got the phone Tuesday morning.  The look and feel of the Mi4i is really good.  Camera: The camera is really class for this price range. It has many options.  Heating issue: I have Moto G 2nd another phone. I played few games on Moto G and Mi4i for more than 20 mins. It was common to see both phones become warm. Took around 25 to 30 photos, no heat generated. Browsed for more hour, it was warm, which is expected in smart phones.  Voice clarity of the phone: It seem to be bit low.  Ran the latest updates on it. Will see how it goes and post another review a week or 2 weeks later.

Execellent and crisp display Sunlight leigibility works as demonstrated Excellent battery backup Updated the software around 810 MB light warm during browsing (here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing, its quite common , i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating, gets warm during browsing) i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing. No heating during making calls Simply superb Good notification led Good camera Played hd games withiut any lag like asphalt  Just go for it without any thoughts. Dont confuse by seeing the reviews as its getting heated like heater, i think some are new for this, so rating badly.

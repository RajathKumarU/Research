after using for more than 3 days and updating to latest miui (Which took almost an hour or two i dont know why?) , it seems phone is not heating too much but still it has heating issues no doubt but only the upper half gets heated. if you are not so into gaming you will not notice . OVER ALL 5 / 5 FOR FEATURES 5 / 5 FOR LOOKS 5 / 5 FOR 1080p DISPLAY 5 / 5 FOR CAMERA 4 / 5 FOR HARWARE (for heating issue, but i dont care almost every phone gets heated be it samsung ,htc etc.)

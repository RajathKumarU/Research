Received this phone yesterday.  Very good screen; Camera is great; Very light weight; Finishing looks good; Call quality is awesome and crystal clear. No heating issue seen in normal usage.  Somewhat disappointed by the less sound volume while playing music. No SD card support- but on board memory is workable for day-to-day use. USB OTG is supported.  Would rate at - 4.5/5.0  Great value for money! If you are looking for a good value for money phone then go for it.

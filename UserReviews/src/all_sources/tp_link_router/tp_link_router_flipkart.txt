5|+ I wanted a good router that would help me use my laptops, tablet and phones at home for browsing. Everyone suggested more famous brands like Belkin and Netgear. But price was also a constraint for me. Heard and read a lot of positive reviews for this and so decided to go for it. + 06 June 2012 - Bought this router and updating this review on 25 Mar 2013. Has been almost a year and it has been wonderful. Setting up the router was fairly easy given that I am not a very tech-savvy person. Just had to follow the instructions in the manual provided with the router. + Range is awesome. I live on the 2nd floor - but I can still browse on my phone when I am walking on the street below in front of my house. Can easily play WiFi games like Carrom 3D on 2 Android devices sitting in 2 different corners of the house. + 14 Sep 2013 - MOrning, the router just stopped working. I tried troubleshooting with the manual provided, but the "System" light did not come on. Has 3 years of warranty and therefore decided to get in touch with TP-Link. Tried calling them on the toll free number, but there was no answer. Maybe because it was a Saturday. So sent out an email to support.in@tp-link.com. Fingers crossed. + 1 Hour Later - There was a reply from a customer care exceutive. I was asked to send across the malfunctioned router to their Mumbai office (I live in Bangalore). They provided the address and promised that this would be resolved soon. + 16 Oct 2013 - I was held up in work and therefore could not send the router to them. So, after a month since the last email, I sent couriered the router to TP-Link's Mumbai office. Once I did, I also sent them an email asking them to acknowledge receipt of the same. Fingers crossed again. + 22 Oct 2013 - No updates from TP-Link yet. I dropped in one more email to them asking if they have received the router I sent and what the status was. + 23 Oct 2013 - A customer care executive replied to my email saying that my device has been received, tested, and will be dispatched back to me shortly. + 30 Oct 2013 - I received a courier from TP-Link's Mumbai office. Inside was a brand new router. Also included was a receipt that said that this was a replacement piece and had other details like the date on which my malfunctioning router was received and tested, the date on which this replacement piece was dispatched etc. Setting up the router again was very easy and I am back online now. Overall comments: From the past 1.5 years I have been using this WiFi router and I have recommended this router to a lot of my friends. I was really upset when the router suddenly stopped working and when there was no response on their toll free number. But a product breaking down cannot be avoided. What matters is the way in which the company handles after-sales service. And I am really happy with the way my case was handled. I got a replacement within 15 days and that says something about the company. Therefore, in short, this is a great product and also a dependable company. Go for it.
5|First of all, an awesome product. No faults anywhere. Worked smoothly from the get-go. Yes it is dd-wrt compatible. Yes the flashing was smooth, no problems anywhere. There are youtube videos targeting the dd-wrt flashing of this exact router. Anyway, the only hiccup I faced was that this router required dd-wrt v8 whose flashing is not as straight forward as v7. For any future buyers, here's what you do: 1) Go to the dd-wrt router database and select the router model v8. 2) Click on other downloads and select the folder whose name is the current year (2014) 3) Download the file having the latest date. 4) Flash the router with that file and follow the rest of the tutorial you are using. Hope this helps :)
5|Excellent service and great buying experience from Flipkart. I bought this router specifically to install and run the DD-WRT firmware and will focus on that aspect in my review. This model is TL-WR841N v7.2 and is compatible with DD-WRT (the model on the DD-WRT website you need to look for TL-WR841ND v7.0; the "D" suffix just means the antennas are detachable in that variant and hardware-wise there is no difference between v7.0 and v7.2) While multiple firmware options are available for Broadcom chipsets, this particular router is based on an Atheros chipset and variety is limited. But the available variety is feature packed and a lot of documentation is available in the Wiki & Forums. If you want to install DD-WRT, just make sure you read through the instructions very carefully before you start the process. I just followed the instructions there and got the firmware working on first try. Currently configured it as a WiFi repeater and everything works satisfactorily. Considering the price I paid, this is an excellent device once you have DD-WRT installed. I have features that even routers from Linksys & Netgear don't have on their stock consumer routers.
5|About this router : awesome, it is cheapest in its category(300 MBPS with RJ45) and working just perfect. Installation took just 5 minutes. Getting full spped anywhere at my home(1100 sq ft.). Although it will show 3-4 bars in other room, you will get full speed(with 2 mbps internet plan getting full 2mbps). Using this on both laptops and both cell phones. Paisa vasool. About Flipkart : Well, I am using flipkart since its beginning. When Sachin Bansal used to distribute coupons on fb and all. And I can clearly see, Its degrading day by day. They have to clearly mention that particular router will work with RJ-45 or RJ-11. I feel cheated and bought another d-link router. Although I am software engineer, I am not that good at networking. I can see OLX flooded with such filipkart customers, who buy here new and after knowing fact that it will not work with his local provider sellin on OLX just another day. Also now a days they are changing prices like its stock exchange. I bought this last saturday in 1580, and today(thursday) it is 1700. Request guys to pay less on Advertisements and work hard on their website specifications.
1|To all those who are buying this hoping that you will be able to run DD WRT on it then DONT BUY IT cos they are now sending v9 of the device and ddwrt supports only till v8. I just got my device today and am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED!!!
3|This is a good router for the price offered; however be prepared for a service nightmare if something has to go wrong. Let me give you a brief of my incident. My router arrived within the time suggested by Flipkart; hoever did not seem to work. I had read reviews on how setting up this particular router may be cumbersome, so I tried and retried configuring it to work. I also got the ISP technician to have a look at the problem but they could not. I called up the TP Link customer care and explained my issue and they were very prompt to suggest that I send the product to their facility at Vasai; approx 40 KMS from Mumbai city. They yet do not have any other service centre; so if something goes wrong you have to ship the product to them. Good thing; I bought this from Flipkart who were prompt to send a replacement the very next day. I'm glad that there is a customer centric online mall. Thanks Flipkart team and I would recommend this site for all your shopping and definately electronic needs. Best price Best service.
4|I Used this Router for 30 days, Really worth for buying, easy Configuration & compatible with All ISP. I could have given 5 star, since the Coverage is really low, so I have given 4 Star. If you have Wall, you will be getting only 2 or 3 signals. if you are happy with that, you can go for that. Except the range issue, this is the best N300 series router to start with. Don't think about NetGear, it is really a piece of Junk, Netgear has to learn a lot from TP-Link.
5|if you are looking for a budget router its your pick. it handles my 10 devices connection well simulteniously. and yes there are some network drops but it happens once in a month. otherwise very fluid data transfer in devices connected with lan por. and i am getting around 10 mbps transfer speed gennerally. writing this review after 6 month of usage and device is still working like a fine tuned car ;)
5|I purchased this only to increase my wifi distance range and it perfectly met all my requirements. I get 2 stick signal strength after crossing 3 walls and about 50 metre distance. Wonderful product, I recommend to everyone who want high speed networking and high range networking at the lowest price. Flipkart - as usual are the best (genuine product, fast delivery)...!!
4|Okay, so... my review of this router is going to based upon what I used to use, the "Belkin wireless g router" and what I expected of this router in terms of the price difference and its competitors which fall within the same league (n-300 routers) Pros - - If you are a nut for specs, yes its got all the bells and whistles like the dual 5dbi antanae's, a good amount of RAM and all that kind of stuff. - The Stock firmware has alot to offer. - Super easy to set up. - A good looking, somewhat compact router. - DD WRT firmware support - Physical Power AND wifi switch. Yes WIFI switch means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical Lan connection. two stars for that. Cons - - Contrary to the first point as given in the pros. I haven't really seen any great improvement with wireless coverage. That being said, i'm quite disappointed because I was expecting this router to have real good coverage. And to be honest, I'm saying no improvement over the Belkin wireless G router(A entry level router). - The notification lights are cumbersome, I need to get my face all the way right on top of it to coordinate the light indicator with its corresponding indicator(Wifi, Lan or wtr) To Conclude This router, yes its cheaper than what you can find for most of the other N 300 rated routers which come from companies like Belkin and of its sort. It's got that nice specification chart, which will matter only to where it counts. The Wifi range was a total put off for me, and its other specification related stuff could be considered as "future proofing" (in case you're planning to have alot of devices connected to it someday.) This router, will be a winner for you especially if you have a lot of devices connected to it, sharing loads of data within the network. We're talking of something in the range above 200 Mb/s. Or even if you're a gamer and you like to have your friends over to have a Co op among-st yourselves, it will comfortably take the task without any glitch's because its got such a wide bandwidth. As this router, in my experience doesn't give any significant boost of any kind with respect to the WIFI coverage. I didnt have to transfer huge lumps of data within my local network. This router was not for me. (I expected it to have a good wifi coverage) And if you fall in the same criteria, I can as sure as hell tell you that you'd be fine with the N 150. But yes, if you have a lot of devices(Printers, Consoles, PC, smartphones etc) which will be connected and will require to both use the internet and simultaneously share loads of data within your home network. This will do you good. Especially for the price.

5|I use cable broadband in Kolkata, they provide you with a CAT5 cable with a RJ-45 jack that directly goes into your LAN Port.and wanted to share my internet connection throughout the house, so i got this router instead of the one with a single antenna just to get the extra coverage. I cannot believe i was able to grab this for just Rs 1425 6 days ago, for some reason the price has shot up since. Although it is one of the cheapest router out there, it certainly isn't low on the performance. Setting up the router took a mere 10 minutes, with only 3-4 steps. Although i knew what i had to do, even someone with almost no prior knowledge could probably have set it up using the quick setup guide. Range is quite decent on this one, i have kept it in the south west room of my house, and i can still get a feeble signal from main gate downstairs in the north east corner of the building, that's almost 3-4 concrete walls apart. I had connected 5-6 devices (Laptop, PC with adapter, Android phones, Symbian phone) at once, worked with each of them flawlessly. Initially I was unable to run a HTTP File sharing server as my internal IP changed but using a feature called Virtual Servers in the Router Setup i could again do that. I was able to transfer files from my PC to laptop at 2-3 MB/s, i'm not sure how to utilize the full 300mbps bandwidth yet, but i'm loooking into it. Highly recommended from me.
2|The router is good when it works properly..I was getting a good range in y 3 bHK apartmet everywhere but after every 3-4 days, it stops functioning and I had to reset the router. Now exactly after 1 month of buying this product, it has stopped working completely and I had to contact TP link customer care who told me the product may be defective and they will replace it. Lets see how long the new piece works because still I have not got it. if that was within one month I could have got it replaced by flipkart. Dont know but recent 3 products I bought from flipkart have malfunctioned in less than 2 months time...seems the quality is degrading at flipkart.
1|This Version v9 is totally useless and waste dont buy it.. guys. it has too much low range . worst than dlink dir 600m .. I've ordered it after watching the review of Geekyranjit. In his review he says that it is awesome but i'd say it's just a crap .. TP-LINK is going down marrket. I've used it's v8 that is awesome but v9 is just a piece of crrap .. guys dont buy it.. I wish i give 1/2 star out of 5 .
1|I purchased this router on 31st July 2014 and it suddenly stopped working today within 10 days and its taking so long to re-configure it again (loading its configuration page by taking almost 2 mins for each page in the configuration process) Totally dissatisfied with this kind of product, requested for return and replacement again from Flipkart... hope I will get a good working piece again, fingers crossed
3|I was using D-Link N150L router and i was getting decent wifi range... it has 1 antenna and i was getting 2-3/4 signal on my 1st floor.. and i was not satisfied so decided to buy this router.. Trust me there's no compression between TP-Link & D-Link... D-Link is way better than this.. after buying this router i'm getting 2/4 signal on my 1st floor (from D-Link i'm getting much better than this with 1 antenna)... I hv 10mbps internet connection.. and with this connection i am getting 300-400kbps on my 1st floor (I'm getting 3-4mbps with my D-Link Router)... I cant even play song on saavn properly.. And i cant stream HD videos with this router standing next to it.... data droppage prblm.. So overall buy it if u only and only want to use whatsapp,wechat,and kind of apps + [Normal video streaming, surfing (Only 4 ground or floor where ur router is) ] And if u expect more spend 100 rs. more and buy D-Link N300 (not N150.. ull get N150 for 1300 rs.) AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT DD-WRT... I installed it.. and PPoE internet was not working on mine... so i decided to got back to stock firmware.. but there are not "Back to stock firmware" available.. and if u use use WINSCP (as described on DD-WRT page) trust me u'll brick your router
5|Got this a few days back from Flipkart. Good product !! Do not want to comment on how fast it was at my doorstep, as its expected from Flipkart now ! The product is great for the price I paid for it. Cheap plastic body. But build looks sturdy. Setup was a breeze. Connected two cables as per the install book, logged in with the web interface, Quick setup, cloned pc mac, restart everything and internet connected ! P.S. the cd supplied is totally useless. Just use the web interface to setup. The range is pretty good and stable, no connection drops as yet. Please note that Flipkart is supplying v8 of this router now. Version 8 does not support DD-WRT as yet. Hopefully it will be out soon OpenWRT is there till then. Overall happy with the purchase !
1|This was ordered after seeing a lot of review comments.but sadly it doesn't walk the talk. also transfer speed is only 2.8~3Mb/ps to my NAS even in N-mode and most importantly though it has 2 antennas ,it barely makes any difference as on same room Iam not getting full signal strength. I will not recommend this product to any one -Eff
5|This is my second purchase from Flipcart and As usual good service from Flipcart... verygood delivery time.. n shipment tracking system is really impressive. it gives usful updates... About Product. Its Verry good product for prise. U dont get anyother router at this prise. for 150N u have to pay around 1500. Just addition of 200bugs u get double speed...worth going for it... to get basic router of other company u have to pay min 2200 2300. ya n it comes with 3yrs warranty... Good for home users with heavy files. single HD media streaming is ofcourse not a load for any 300n router so to put it under stress n test i streamed 3 HD movies at a time over my two laptops (one lenovo z570 n other dell)n WD live tv media hub connected to my Tv set. n to my surprise still there was no lag. so i aslo connected two of my samsung Phones(one pop and other ace) with tikona wired net connection... and stated download... n hush... finally I found lag...hahaha. wat more u expect from home wifi...its covering my whole flat with good signal so my purpose is solved. cons:- cd which comes with this dosent contain easy setup files for this router(Big surprise)... but anyways u dont need one if u have basic knowledge of routers or if u have win vista or 7... overall go for it.... Very good value for money
1|After seeing the wonderful reviews i had purchased this TP link router and its worst of its kind... except the price there is no pro for this router cons: 1. difficult setup 2.connectivity problems 3.very slow streaming Besides all these the customer care of the TPlink is worst and very rude.... Flipkart should not encourage such products....
5|+ I wanted a good router that would help me use my laptops, tablet and phones at home for browsing. Everyone suggested more famous brands like Belkin and Netgear.

Can easily play WiFi games like Carrom 3D on 2 Android devices sitting in 2 different corners of the house. + 14 Sep 2013 - MOrning, the router just stopped working. I tried troubleshooting with the manual provided, but the "System" light did not come on. Has 3 years of warranty and therefore decided to get in touch with TP-Link.

5|First of all, an awesome product. No faults anywhere. Worked smoothly from the get-go. Yes it is dd-wrt compatible. Yes the flashing was smooth, no problems anywhere. There are youtube videos targeting the dd-wrt flashing of this exact router. Anyway, the only hiccup I faced was that this router required dd-wrt v8 whose flashing is not as straight forward as v7. For any future buyers, here's what you do: 1) Go to the dd-wrt router database and select the router model v8. 2) Click on other downloads and select the folder whose name is the current year (2014) 3) Download the file having the latest date. 4) Flash the router with that file and follow the rest of the tutorial you are using. Hope this helps :)
5|Excellent service and great buying experience from Flipkart. I bought this router specifically to install and run the DD-WRT firmware and will focus on that aspect in my review. This model is TL-WR841N v7.2 and is compatible with DD-WRT (the model on the DD-WRT website you need to look for TL-WR841ND v7.0; the "D" suffix just means the antennas are detachable in that variant and hardware-wise there is no difference between v7.0 and v7.2) While multiple firmware options are available for Broadcom chipsets, this particular router is based on an Atheros chipset and variety is limited. But the available variety is feature packed and a lot of documentation is available in the Wiki & Forums. If you want to install DD-WRT, just make sure you read through the instructions very carefully before you start the process. I just followed the instructions there and got the firmware working on first try. Currently configured it as a WiFi repeater and everything works satisfactorily. Considering the price I paid, this is an excellent device once you have DD-WRT installed. I have features that even routers from Linksys & Netgear don't have on their stock consumer routers.
5|About this router : awesome, it is cheapest in its category(300 MBPS with RJ45) and working just perfect. Installation took just 5 minutes. Getting full spped anywhere at my home(1100 sq ft.). Although it will show 3-4 bars in other room, you will get full speed(with 2 mbps internet plan getting full 2mbps). Using this on both laptops and both cell phones. Paisa vasool. About Flipkart : Well, I am using flipkart since its beginning. When Sachin Bansal used to distribute coupons on fb and all. And I can clearly see, Its degrading day by day. They have to clearly mention that particular router will work with RJ-45 or RJ-11. I feel cheated and bought another d-link router. Although I am software engineer, I am not that good at networking. I can see OLX flooded with such filipkart customers, who buy here new and after knowing fact that it will not work with his local provider sellin on OLX just another day. Also now a days they are changing prices like its stock exchange. I bought this last saturday in 1580, and today(thursday) it is 1700. Request guys to pay less on Advertisements and work hard on their website specifications.
1|To all those who are buying this hoping that you will be able to run DD WRT on it then DONT BUY IT cos they are now sending v9 of the device and ddwrt supports only till v8. I just got my device today and am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED!!!
3|This is a good router for the price offered; however be prepared for a service nightmare if something has to go wrong. Let me give you a brief of my incident. My router arrived within the time suggested by Flipkart; hoever did not seem to work. I had read reviews on how setting up this particular router may be cumbersome, so I tried and retried configuring it to work. I also got the ISP technician to have a look at the problem but they could not. I called up the TP Link customer care and explained my issue and they were very prompt to suggest that I send the product to their facility at Vasai; approx 40 KMS from Mumbai city. They yet do not have any other service centre; so if something goes wrong you have to ship the product to them. Good thing; I bought this from Flipkart who were prompt to send a replacement the very next day. I'm glad that there is a customer centric online mall. Thanks Flipkart team and I would recommend this site for all your shopping and definately electronic needs. Best price Best service.
4|I Used this Router for 30 days, Really worth for buying, easy Configuration & compatible with All ISP. I could have given 5 star, since the Coverage is really low, so I have given 4 Star. If you have Wall, you will be getting only 2 or 3 signals. if you are happy with that, you can go for that. Except the range issue, this is the best N300 series router to start with. Don't think about NetGear, it is really a piece of Junk, Netgear has to learn a lot from TP-Link.
5|if you are looking for a budget router its your pick. it handles my 10 devices connection well simulteniously. and yes there are some network drops but it happens once in a month. otherwise very fluid data transfer in devices connected with lan por. and i am getting around 10 mbps transfer speed gennerally. writing this review after 6 month of usage and device is still working like a fine tuned car ;)
5|I purchased this only to increase my wifi distance range and it perfectly met all my requirements. I get 2 stick signal strength after crossing 3 walls and about 50 metre distance. Wonderful product, I recommend to everyone who want high speed networking and high range networking at the lowest price. Flipkart - as usual are the best (genuine product, fast delivery)...!!
4|Okay, so... my review of this router is going to based upon what I used to use, the "Belkin wireless g router" and what I expected of this router in terms of the price difference and its competitors which fall within the same league (n-300 routers) Pros - - If you are a nut for specs, yes its got all the bells and whistles like the dual 5dbi antanae's, a good amount of RAM and all that kind of stuff. - The Stock firmware has alot to offer. - Super easy to set up. - A good looking, somewhat compact router. - DD WRT firmware support - Physical Power AND wifi switch. Yes WIFI switch means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical Lan connection. two stars for that. Cons - - Contrary to the first point as given in the pros. I haven't really seen any great improvement with wireless coverage. That being said, i'm quite disappointed because I was expecting this router to have real good coverage. And to be honest, I'm saying no improvement over the Belkin wireless G router(A entry level router). - The notification lights are cumbersome, I need to get my face all the way right on top of it to coordinate the light indicator with its corresponding indicator(Wifi, Lan or wtr) To Conclude This router, yes its cheaper than what you can find for most of the other N 300 rated routers which come from companies like Belkin and of its sort. It's got that nice specification chart, which will matter only to where it counts. The Wifi range was a total put off for me, and its other specification related stuff could be considered as "future proofing" (in case you're planning to have alot of devices connected to it someday.) This router, will be a winner for you especially if you have a lot of devices connected to it, sharing loads of data within the network. We're talking of something in the range above 200 Mb/s. Or even if you're a gamer and you like to have your friends over to have a Co op among-st yourselves, it will comfortably take the task without any glitch's because its got such a wide bandwidth. As this router, in my experience doesn't give any significant boost of any kind with respect to the WIFI coverage. I didnt have to transfer huge lumps of data within my local network. This router was not for me. (I expected it to have a good wifi coverage) And if you fall in the same criteria, I can as sure as hell tell you that you'd be fine with the N 150. But yes, if you have a lot of devices(Printers, Consoles, PC, smartphones etc) which will be connected and will require to both use the internet and simultaneously share loads of data within your home network. This will do you good. Especially for the price.
5|I use cable broadband in Kolkata, they provide you with a CAT5 cable with a RJ-45 jack that directly goes into your LAN Port.and wanted to share my internet connection throughout the house, so i got this router instead of the one with a single antenna just to get the extra coverage. I cannot believe i was able to grab this for just Rs 1425 6 days ago, for some reason the price has shot up since. Although it is one of the cheapest router out there, it certainly isn't low on the performance. Setting up the router took a mere 10 minutes, with only 3-4 steps. Although i knew what i had to do, even someone with almost no prior knowledge could probably have set it up using the quick setup guide. Range is quite decent on this one, i have kept it in the south west room of my house, and i can still get a feeble signal from main gate downstairs in the north east corner of the building, that's almost 3-4 concrete walls apart. I had connected 5-6 devices (Laptop, PC with adapter, Android phones, Symbian phone) at once, worked with each of them flawlessly. Initially I was unable to run a HTTP File sharing server as my internal IP changed but using a feature called Virtual Servers in the Router Setup i could again do that. I was able to transfer files from my PC to laptop at 2-3 MB/s, i'm not sure how to utilize the full 300mbps bandwidth yet, but i'm loooking into it. Highly recommended from me.
2|The router is good when it works properly..I was getting a good range in y 3 bHK apartmet everywhere but after every 3-4 days, it stops functioning and I had to reset the router. Now exactly after 1 month of buying this product, it has stopped working completely and I had to contact TP link customer care who told me the product may be defective and they will replace it. Lets see how long the new piece works because still I have not got it. if that was within one month I could have got it replaced by flipkart. Dont know but recent 3 products I bought from flipkart have malfunctioned in less than 2 months time...seems the quality is degrading at flipkart.
1|This Version v9 is totally useless and waste dont buy it.. guys. it has too much low range . worst than dlink dir 600m .. I've ordered it after watching the review of Geekyranjit. In his review he says that it is awesome but i'd say it's just a crap .. TP-LINK is going down marrket. I've used it's v8 that is awesome but v9 is just a piece of crrap .. guys dont buy it.. I wish i give 1/2 star out of 5 .
1|I purchased this router on 31st July 2014 and it suddenly stopped working today within 10 days and its taking so long to re-configure it again (loading its configuration page by taking almost 2 mins for each page in the configuration process) Totally dissatisfied with this kind of product, requested for return and replacement again from Flipkart... hope I will get a good working piece again, fingers crossed
3|I was using D-Link N150L router and i was getting decent wifi range... it has 1 antenna and i was getting 2-3/4 signal on my 1st floor.. and i was not satisfied so decided to buy this router.. Trust me there's no compression between TP-Link & D-Link... D-Link is way better than this.. after buying this router i'm getting 2/4 signal on my 1st floor (from D-Link i'm getting much better than this with 1 antenna)... I hv 10mbps internet connection.. and with this connection i am getting 300-400kbps on my 1st floor (I'm getting 3-4mbps with my D-Link Router)... I cant even play song on saavn properly.. And i cant stream HD videos with this router standing next to it.... data droppage prblm.. So overall buy it if u only and only want to use whatsapp,wechat,and kind of apps + [Normal video streaming, surfing (Only 4 ground or floor where ur router is) ] And if u expect more spend 100 rs. more and buy D-Link N300 (not N150.. ull get N150 for 1300 rs.) AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT DD-WRT... I installed it.. and PPoE internet was not working on mine... so i decided to got back to stock firmware.. but there are not "Back to stock firmware" available.. and if u use use WINSCP (as described on DD-WRT page) trust me u'll brick your router
5|Got this a few days back from Flipkart. Good product !! Do not want to comment on how fast it was at my doorstep, as its expected from Flipkart now ! The product is great for the price I paid for it. Cheap plastic body. But build looks sturdy. Setup was a breeze. Connected two cables as per the install book, logged in with the web interface, Quick setup, cloned pc mac, restart everything and internet connected ! P.S. the cd supplied is totally useless. Just use the web interface to setup. The range is pretty good and stable, no connection drops as yet. Please note that Flipkart is supplying v8 of this router now. Version 8 does not support DD-WRT as yet. Hopefully it will be out soon OpenWRT is there till then. Overall happy with the purchase !
1|This was ordered after seeing a lot of review comments.but sadly it doesn't walk the talk. also transfer speed is only 2.8~3Mb/ps to my NAS even in N-mode and most importantly though it has 2 antennas ,it barely makes any difference as on same room Iam not getting full signal strength. I will not recommend this product to any one -Eff
5|This is my second purchase from Flipcart and As usual good service from Flipcart... verygood delivery time.. n shipment tracking system is really impressive. it gives usful updates... About Product. Its Verry good product for prise. U dont get anyother router at this prise. for 150N u have to pay around 1500. Just addition of 200bugs u get double speed...worth going for it... to get basic router of other company u have to pay min 2200 2300. ya n it comes with 3yrs warranty... Good for home users with heavy files. single HD media streaming is ofcourse not a load for any 300n router so to put it under stress n test i streamed 3 HD movies at a time over my two laptops (one lenovo z570 n other dell)n WD live tv media hub connected to my Tv set. n to my surprise still there was no lag. so i aslo connected two of my samsung Phones(one pop and other ace) with tikona wired net connection... and stated download... n hush... finally I found lag...hahaha. wat more u expect from home wifi...its covering my whole flat with good signal so my purpose is solved. cons:- cd which comes with this dosent contain easy setup files for this router(Big surprise)... but anyways u dont need one if u have basic knowledge of routers or if u have win vista or 7... overall go for it.... Very good value for money
1|After seeing the wonderful reviews i had purchased this TP link router and its worst of its kind... except the price there is no pro for this router cons: 1. difficult setup 2.connectivity problems 3.very slow streaming Besides all these the customer care of the TPlink is worst and very rude.... Flipkart should not encourage such products....
1|waste of money.... with 150Mbps Intex router getting strong range...TP link is not giving range in adjecent room also....highly dissatified.............Very Bad quality product......
2|Better go for d-link because d range if you compare it with a d-link product, this tp-link is not as good as d-link...! I thought my product is faulty and asked for replacement flipkart told me to contact tp-links customer service so i did n they told me that because of walls ur range might reduce but i did compared with my neighours d-link router whose network i can recive in my place but i can't receive my routers network at his home...! Seriously go for d-link product at this price budget!!
4|best cheap router and i m giving it less than 5 star because the wireless transmission dATA is a bit low
4|Received the product yesterday. Took no time setting this up. The range is pretty damn good. Goes beyond 2 thick walls and a distance of 25 feet with decent reception. The only problem is that TP-Link is rolling out v10 of the product which does not yet have dd-wrt or open-wrt support yet.
5|+ I wanted a good router that would help me use my laptops, tablet and phones at home for browsing. Everyone suggested more famous brands like Belkin and Netgear. But price was also a constraint for me. Heard and read a lot of positive reviews for this and so decided to go for it. + Bought this router and updating this review on 25 Mar 2013. Has been almost a year and it has been wonderful. Setting up the router was fairly easy given that I am not a very tech-savvy person. Just had to follow the instructions in the manual provided with the router. + Range is awesome. I live on the 2nd floor - but I can still browse on my phone when I am walking on the street below in front of my house. Can easily play WiFi games like Carrom 3D on 2 Android devices sitting in 2 different corners of the house. also i am using it to connect gaming consoles. wps option is great....................
1|I purchase this item just few day ago. my experience is very bad with this product. this product needs reset very 2 hours, its very irritating. I have 2 MBPS internet line, when i'm using the wifi with cell phone my desktop speed is very low, and when i'm using the desktop wifi is not working with internet data. all over don't purchase that product.
1|This one of the worst product I used from the FlipKart. not able to connect sometimes. this is a port problem definitely. Happy to replace.
4|Hi to all, Product delivered to me in a day as promised by flipkart via ekart services. I could not find any customer care contact number in india, so called up china (global care)shenzhen, guangdong and service representatives were supportive. The installation document shows setup for RJ45/ethernet connection from modem to router but the router setup can also be made through direct ethernet cable without using any modem. Finally in perfect use, no issue found till day, after a day use.
5|I used it for my home. All the are of my home are covered.I get the signal in my 2nd floor and 3rd floor too (though the single are slow in 3rd floor). I am happy with it's performance. If you use it for home then it's the best budgeted router in the market
3|Most of the reviews for this products boast about its range but I found out the range to be mediocre and nothing to cheer about. If you are looking for a router which can provide range beyond 3 walls then this product is not for you. PS: The router I have received has 8 led indicators. Some sites mention other version of this router has 9 LED indicators which has a better range. Even the product specs on Flipkart has mentioned 9 LED indicators but they are providing other version.

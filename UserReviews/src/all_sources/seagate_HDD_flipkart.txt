5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.

5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives.

1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.

4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB

Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.

I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.

Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart.

I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)

5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section.

1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That .

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th.

4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product ....

3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well.

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well.

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That .

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
1|Guys this hard disk is really a good choice, if you are going to purchase for work purpose.....Thanks to Flipkart for makin available such kind of products on affordable price.
1|Don't ever think about it. I had a worst experience with this hard disk. Every time it will ask for Format the disk. never buy it from Flipkart. U won't get proper response form them also.
2|Slipped from the top of my CPU to the floor (Hardly couple foots distance) and it was inside a sponge cover but still itsnot working anymore. :( Had it only 2 months ago.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well.

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
1|Guys this hard disk is really a good choice, if you are going to purchase for work purpose.....Thanks to Flipkart for makin available such kind of products on affordable price.
1|Don't ever think about it. I had a worst experience with this hard disk. Every time it will ask for Format the disk. never buy it from Flipkart. U won't get proper response form them also.
2|Slipped from the top of my CPU to the floor (Hardly couple foots distance) and it was inside a sponge cover but still itsnot working anymore. :( Had it only 2 months ago.
1|Backup plus is using samsung hdd inside the cover -- very disappointing. cannot expect this from seagate.(can't they use seagate as we believe seagate and not samsung ) if ever you try to open the cover , will break all the plastic locks of case. and then the warranty become 0. (can not they give user friendly interface to open HDD) the usb 3.0 is very loose , which make loose contact with pc. and HDD partition become RAW(bed partition). disappointed with seagate.
4|Performance is good but there is a big problem with this drive that its not compatible with Ubuntu OS.
1|This is my 2nd hard disk from Seagate. The 1st was FreeAgent Go Flex 500 GB - worked for about 18 months. Developed an adapter problem. Now I bought this 1 Tb 2 months back. IT has probably developed an adapter problem once again. Been going through other reviews - many problems encountered by other users. This warranty thing also sucks. No retrieval of data. Just replacement that too takes about a month. Prefer a Weston HDD. Some of my friends using it. Seagate I have lost trust.
5|I purchased this HDD 3 days ago on 3rd of January and got this today on the 7th. I am impressed by Flipkart's delivery services and pleased to get the purchased item on the given time. Now to the product :) The HDD has beautiful looks , gives a silver colored light when connected ( USB 2.0 ) , sleek and stylish. The data transfer rate is pretty good , 30-35Mbps for USB 2.0 , ( havn't tested with usb3.0 ). It can easily fit into your pocket and well , for extra knowledge about the item , It runs on NTFS which is far more superior than FAT32 ( in my views :P ) The only thing thats a little disappointing is that the length of the cable is pretty short ( 18" ) otherwise , its a fantastic product. A salute to Flipkart and Seagate. This was my first review here on Flipkart. Hope I was useful.
5|I am super impressed with the device and with Flipkart also. Never expected I will get the delivery on a Sunday. I bought a blue 1 TB version and I am liking it. The device is even smaller than the smartphone I am using, not to mention lighter. Before making the purchase, I read the user comments and that's why I was ready to see a small connecting cable. So, finally when I got my hands on the stuff, I found the cable to be fine only. The packaging is just superb. Very glad to have bought this. Definitely recommended.
5|This is my 3rd product frm flipkart. awesome punctuality. apart frm this. product is very gud. you hav 931 GB. 4 videos abt seagate dashboard. this s 4 automatic backup. very stylish. 100% trusty nd worthy. if u go 4 1tb hd this s d best nd finest choice. thq.
1|I bought this hdd on 15th October 2013.I connected the Hdd and was getting ready to backup my data and since I was a first time user I left the HDD connected and opened up the seagate dashboard running after setting up the back up plan and kept the computer on for the whole day. Evenibg when I came back to check the backup done to my surprise the back did not start as there was an initial job pending error. I tried contacting customer care but they are closef all the time even in business hours.Aftet trying multiple times I was able to get touch with the cust care rep. He sent me a file which contained outdated SW called seagate manager which was able to back up my PC data but was not able to bakup my facebook data. Today i 've been struggling to get in touch with the cx care rep since the ladt 10 days and still the offices are closed. I don't know who will be able to help me. If someone has a resolution for initial job pending error please help.
1|The external hard disk I received has really disappointed me. The data transfer speed is less than my pen drive. I have just wasted my money on this. Think before you buy this product. Flipkart has really annoyed me.
1|its really one of the worst product from seagate its really horrible i had brought it in other website its not at all detecting by my laptop watse of money useless product all my data lost and service from seagate is really pathetic please dnt buy it ull face the trouble..!!1
2|First of all,hats off delivery executive and packing...as always B4 TIME. I am little abset about the price bcoz i book the product when it was 6.7k but now they reduced to 5,650/-...anyway worth to purchase. Bcoz i had waited 8-10 months for reducing the prices. Now, i will tell u abt the product. Cable around 18'' black USB 3.0...also support on USB 2.0 Light weight..black surface...loks NICE Now, abt SPEED.... I have USB 2.0 system,i MOVED(not copied) 12.7 GB data at a time and it took around 13-14 mins @ 13-14 MB/sec....But COPIED 3.91 GB video data @ 25-30 MB/sec in 3-4 mins.......wht more i can say(Laughs) SO, let me test some more days and i will write my next review very soon......Thnaks...........@:@
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)

5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
1|Guys this hard disk is really a good choice, if you are going to purchase for work purpose.....Thanks to Flipkart for makin available such kind of products on affordable price.
1|Don't ever think about it. I had a worst experience with this hard disk. Every time it will ask for Format the disk. never buy it from Flipkart. U won't get proper response form them also.
2|Slipped from the top of my CPU to the floor (Hardly couple foots distance) and it was inside a sponge cover but still itsnot working anymore. :( Had it only 2 months ago.
1|Backup plus is using samsung hdd inside the cover -- very disappointing. cannot expect this from seagate.(can't they use seagate as we believe seagate and not samsung ) if ever you try to open the cover , will break all the plastic locks of case. and then the warranty become 0. (can not they give user friendly interface to open HDD) the usb 3.0 is very loose , which make loose contact with pc. and HDD partition become RAW(bed partition). disappointed with seagate.
4|Performance is good but there is a big problem with this drive that its not compatible with Ubuntu OS.
1|This is my 2nd hard disk from Seagate. The 1st was FreeAgent Go Flex 500 GB - worked for about 18 months. Developed an adapter problem. Now I bought this 1 Tb 2 months back. IT has probably developed an adapter problem once again. Been going through other reviews - many problems encountered by other users. This warranty thing also sucks. No retrieval of data. Just replacement that too takes about a month. Prefer a Weston HDD. Some of my friends using it. Seagate I have lost trust.
5|I purchased this HDD 3 days ago on 3rd of January and got this today on the 7th. I am impressed by Flipkart's delivery services and pleased to get the purchased item on the given time. Now to the product :) The HDD has beautiful looks , gives a silver colored light when connected ( USB 2.0 ) , sleek and stylish. The data transfer rate is pretty good , 30-35Mbps for USB 2.0 , ( havn't tested with usb3.0 ). It can easily fit into your pocket and well , for extra knowledge about the item , It runs on NTFS which is far more superior than FAT32 ( in my views :P ) The only thing thats a little disappointing is that the length of the cable is pretty short ( 18" ) otherwise , its a fantastic product. A salute to Flipkart and Seagate. This was my first review here on Flipkart. Hope I was useful.
5|I am super impressed with the device and with Flipkart also. Never expected I will get the delivery on a Sunday. I bought a blue 1 TB version and I am liking it. The device is even smaller than the smartphone I am using, not to mention lighter. Before making the purchase, I read the user comments and that's why I was ready to see a small connecting cable. So, finally when I got my hands on the stuff, I found the cable to be fine only. The packaging is just superb. Very glad to have bought this. Definitely recommended.
5|This is my 3rd product frm flipkart. awesome punctuality. apart frm this. product is very gud. you hav 931 GB. 4 videos abt seagate dashboard. this s 4 automatic backup. very stylish. 100% trusty nd worthy. if u go 4 1tb hd this s d best nd finest choice. thq.
1|I bought this hdd on 15th October 2013.I connected the Hdd and was getting ready to backup my data and since I was a first time user I left the HDD connected and opened up the seagate dashboard running after setting up the back up plan and kept the computer on for the whole day. Evenibg when I came back to check the backup done to my surprise the back did not start as there was an initial job pending error. I tried contacting customer care but they are closef all the time even in business hours.Aftet trying multiple times I was able to get touch with the cust care rep. He sent me a file which contained outdated SW called seagate manager which was able to back up my PC data but was not able to bakup my facebook data. Today i 've been struggling to get in touch with the cx care rep since the ladt 10 days and still the offices are closed. I don't know who will be able to help me. If someone has a resolution for initial job pending error please help.
1|The external hard disk I received has really disappointed me. The data transfer speed is less than my pen drive. I have just wasted my money on this. Think before you buy this product. Flipkart has really annoyed me.
1|its really one of the worst product from seagate its really horrible i had brought it in other website its not at all detecting by my laptop watse of money useless product all my data lost and service from seagate is really pathetic please dnt buy it ull face the trouble..!!1
2|First of all,hats off delivery executive and packing...as always B4 TIME. I am little abset about the price bcoz i book the product when it was 6.7k but now they reduced to 5,650/-...anyway worth to purchase. Bcoz i had waited 8-10 months for reducing the prices. Now, i will tell u abt the product. Cable around 18'' black USB 3.0...also support on USB 2.0 Light weight..black surface...loks NICE Now, abt SPEED.... I have USB 2.0 system,i MOVED(not copied) 12.7 GB data at a time and it took around 13-14 mins @ 13-14 MB/sec....But COPIED 3.91 GB video data @ 25-30 MB/sec in 3-4 mins.......wht more i can say(Laughs) SO, let me test some more days and i will write my next review very soon......Thnaks...........@:@
1|FLIPKART IS A CHEATER NOW AS THEY CAN NOT FULLFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS AND TRY TO FOOL PEOPLE THEY SAY FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU HAVE PURCHASED 11 HARD DISK I GUESS FLIPKART BUYS HARD DISK TO USE AS TOILET PAPER.THEY CALL AND SAY YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN CONFIRMEND BUT NOT APPROVED WHICH ACCORDING TO ANY PERSON WHO IS SANE MEANS THE SAME OOHH SORRY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SANE PEOPLE NOT FLIPKART EMPLOYEES FOR THEM IT DOES NOT MEAN THE SAME.A BIG FAT CHEAT FLIPKART.
5|I just received my order. i was very excited while unpacked the parcel. However, all excitement was turned into disappointment when i connected the hard drive to my laptop. It says it is 1 TB backup plus.. But it did not have 1024 GB space.. I only can see 931 GB space capacity.. Really i am shocked to see that i have been robbed of almost 70 GB space... yet to check other features... seriously...can anyone tell me ... what happened to the rest of the space... had it been max 10 GB space i would have compromised on the same. but it is too much to convince myself.. checked on the internet. about the space in any hard disk of 1 TB. used it for a month and found it to be exceptionally good with no heating problems. It is quite robust as i dropped it couple of times and still working... lol.. full marks to hard disk company and extra marks for Flip Kart to deliver it in stipulated time...
4|This disk have good data transfer rate and does not get hot in a continuous long time use. Also it is very robust, by mistake it was felled by me from around 6 feet 2 times but it only opened and after just fitting it is working fine, good job Seagate, only the problem is of very short USB cable and it is of special type, so rare chance to get same type of long cable, here improvement is required from Seagate. Over all it is good and go for it.
5|I preferred this over WD and i am bery much happy till date. The transfer speed is very good both in USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 My cable has went down to be little loose after 1 and 1/2 years of use but that too because of soo much rough use. I would say Seagate provide the best HD drives in the world. WD is good but i would prefer Seagate coz i had used both of them and found Seagate to be more efficient and friendly. Dont go on some losers writing false and foolish review about Seagate. A must buy in external series.
2|I bought this External HDD, It broke 2 times in 3 years, although the seagate warranty got it covered but anyways I lost all my data. Not recommended.
5|this product is realy good. USB cable that comes with it is short. But its good speed to move files and Well suitabe for PCs too.
2|you see the two piece construction, it got loose first, & then it finally broke the link cuz of the looseness, so i had to buy & install the BUS which joins a hard disk to USB. and who goes to service centre for a harddisk, seagate is best just dont buy this model
4|I've purchased it 2 years back. Still no issues and data transfer speed is fair. Best brand for external hard disks.
2|this product is working fine and up/down speed is good... but sad thing is i purchased this product on high price compare to all other online.... trusting flip kart i purchased on high price but very next day the price got reduced suddenly 1200/-........its very bad... in flip kart.
4|I have been using this product for almost two years now and still it is working perfectly fine. It works very silently and the speed is also awesome. Also the backup software provided is very useful for backing up personal data instantly. My laptop went bad and thanks to this hard disk I was able to retrieve my data as it had been backed up on it. Sincerely I have not been able to find any fault in it even after two years. I would highly recommend this product as it is a great one from Seagate.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That . When my internal HD was gone. i buy The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk & Works Well. So i recommend my Uncle & He Buy Also -----ABOUT HDD----- 1.NICE DESIGN 2.CABLE IS SHORT As Cable Length Increase Data Transferring Speed Decrease .So Better is Less Length 3.Commonly External HDD are INTERNAL LAPTOP HDD So Better LIfe 4.Internal HDD HAS 1 YEAR WARRANTY But External HAS 3 YEAR BETTER KNOW !! 5.BY Comparing To Other HDD Seagate GOOD 6.U Can Upgrade USB 4 OR TO UP !!! 7.SEAGATE Gives Back up Software in HDD ----ADVISE--- 1.ALWAYS PLUG IN BACK USB PORT OF YOUR DESKTOP PC [for desktop users] It Will Give U More Life 2.Don't Fallen From Up .ALL-WAYS KEEP A CARE 3.WHEN TRANSPORTING DISCONNECT USB CABLE FROM HDD
3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
1|Guys this hard disk is really a good choice, if you are going to purchase for work purpose.....Thanks to Flipkart for makin available such kind of products on affordable price.
1|Don't ever think about it. I had a worst experience with this hard disk. Every time it will ask for Format the disk. never buy it from Flipkart. U won't get proper response form them also.
2|Slipped from the top of my CPU to the floor (Hardly couple foots distance) and it was inside a sponge cover but still itsnot working anymore. :( Had it only 2 months ago.
1|Backup plus is using samsung hdd inside the cover -- very disappointing. cannot expect this from seagate.(can't they use seagate as we believe seagate and not samsung ) if ever you try to open the cover , will break all the plastic locks of case. and then the warranty become 0. (can not they give user friendly interface to open HDD) the usb 3.0 is very loose , which make loose contact with pc. and HDD partition become RAW(bed partition). disappointed with seagate.
4|Performance is good but there is a big problem with this drive that its not compatible with Ubuntu OS.
1|This is my 2nd hard disk from Seagate. The 1st was FreeAgent Go Flex 500 GB - worked for about 18 months. Developed an adapter problem. Now I bought this 1 Tb 2 months back. IT has probably developed an adapter problem once again. Been going through other reviews - many problems encountered by other users. This warranty thing also sucks. No retrieval of data. Just replacement that too takes about a month. Prefer a Weston HDD. Some of my friends using it. Seagate I have lost trust.
5|I purchased this HDD 3 days ago on 3rd of January and got this today on the 7th. I am impressed by Flipkart's delivery services and pleased to get the purchased item on the given time. Now to the product :) The HDD has beautiful looks , gives a silver colored light when connected ( USB 2.0 ) , sleek and stylish. The data transfer rate is pretty good , 30-35Mbps for USB 2.0 , ( havn't tested with usb3.0 ). It can easily fit into your pocket and well , for extra knowledge about the item , It runs on NTFS which is far more superior than FAT32 ( in my views :P ) The only thing thats a little disappointing is that the length of the cable is pretty short ( 18" ) otherwise , its a fantastic product. A salute to Flipkart and Seagate. This was my first review here on Flipkart. Hope I was useful.
5|I am super impressed with the device and with Flipkart also. Never expected I will get the delivery on a Sunday. I bought a blue 1 TB version and I am liking it. The device is even smaller than the smartphone I am using, not to mention lighter. Before making the purchase, I read the user comments and that's why I was ready to see a small connecting cable. So, finally when I got my hands on the stuff, I found the cable to be fine only. The packaging is just superb. Very glad to have bought this. Definitely recommended.
5|This is my 3rd product frm flipkart. awesome punctuality. apart frm this. product is very gud. you hav 931 GB. 4 videos abt seagate dashboard. this s 4 automatic backup. very stylish. 100% trusty nd worthy. if u go 4 1tb hd this s d best nd finest choice. thq.
1|I bought this hdd on 15th October 2013.I connected the Hdd and was getting ready to backup my data and since I was a first time user I left the HDD connected and opened up the seagate dashboard running after setting up the back up plan and kept the computer on for the whole day. Evenibg when I came back to check the backup done to my surprise the back did not start as there was an initial job pending error. I tried contacting customer care but they are closef all the time even in business hours.Aftet trying multiple times I was able to get touch with the cust care rep. He sent me a file which contained outdated SW called seagate manager which was able to back up my PC data but was not able to bakup my facebook data. Today i 've been struggling to get in touch with the cx care rep since the ladt 10 days and still the offices are closed. I don't know who will be able to help me. If someone has a resolution for initial job pending error please help.
1|The external hard disk I received has really disappointed me. The data transfer speed is less than my pen drive. I have just wasted my money on this. Think before you buy this product. Flipkart has really annoyed me.
1|its really one of the worst product from seagate its really horrible i had brought it in other website its not at all detecting by my laptop watse of money useless product all my data lost and service from seagate is really pathetic please dnt buy it ull face the trouble..!!1
2|First of all,hats off delivery executive and packing...as always B4 TIME. I am little abset about the price bcoz i book the product when it was 6.7k but now they reduced to 5,650/-...anyway worth to purchase. Bcoz i had waited 8-10 months for reducing the prices. Now, i will tell u abt the product. Cable around 18'' black USB 3.0...also support on USB 2.0 Light weight..black surface...loks NICE Now, abt SPEED.... I have USB 2.0 system,i MOVED(not copied) 12.7 GB data at a time and it took around 13-14 mins @ 13-14 MB/sec....But COPIED 3.91 GB video data @ 25-30 MB/sec in 3-4 mins.......wht more i can say(Laughs) SO, let me test some more days and i will write my next review very soon......Thnaks...........@:@
1|FLIPKART IS A CHEATER NOW AS THEY CAN NOT FULLFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS AND TRY TO FOOL PEOPLE THEY SAY FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU HAVE PURCHASED 11 HARD DISK I GUESS FLIPKART BUYS HARD DISK TO USE AS TOILET PAPER.THEY CALL AND SAY YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN CONFIRMEND BUT NOT APPROVED WHICH ACCORDING TO ANY PERSON WHO IS SANE MEANS THE SAME OOHH SORRY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SANE PEOPLE NOT FLIPKART EMPLOYEES FOR THEM IT DOES NOT MEAN THE SAME.A BIG FAT CHEAT FLIPKART.
5|I just received my order. i was very excited while unpacked the parcel. However, all excitement was turned into disappointment when i connected the hard drive to my laptop. It says it is 1 TB backup plus.. But it did not have 1024 GB space.. I only can see 931 GB space capacity.. Really i am shocked to see that i have been robbed of almost 70 GB space... yet to check other features... seriously...can anyone tell me ... what happened to the rest of the space... had it been max 10 GB space i would have compromised on the same. but it is too much to convince myself.. checked on the internet. about the space in any hard disk of 1 TB. used it for a month and found it to be exceptionally good with no heating problems. It is quite robust as i dropped it couple of times and still working... lol.. full marks to hard disk company and extra marks for Flip Kart to deliver it in stipulated time...
4|This disk have good data transfer rate and does not get hot in a continuous long time use. Also it is very robust, by mistake it was felled by me from around 6 feet 2 times but it only opened and after just fitting it is working fine, good job Seagate, only the problem is of very short USB cable and it is of special type, so rare chance to get same type of long cable, here improvement is required from Seagate. Over all it is good and go for it.
5|I preferred this over WD and i am bery much happy till date. The transfer speed is very good both in USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 My cable has went down to be little loose after 1 and 1/2 years of use but that too because of soo much rough use. I would say Seagate provide the best HD drives in the world. WD is good but i would prefer Seagate coz i had used both of them and found Seagate to be more efficient and friendly. Dont go on some losers writing false and foolish review about Seagate. A must buy in external series.
2|I bought this External HDD, It broke 2 times in 3 years, although the seagate warranty got it covered but anyways I lost all my data. Not recommended.
5|this product is realy good. USB cable that comes with it is short. But its good speed to move files and Well suitabe for PCs too.
2|you see the two piece construction, it got loose first, & then it finally broke the link cuz of the looseness, so i had to buy & install the BUS which joins a hard disk to USB. and who goes to service centre for a harddisk, seagate is best just dont buy this model
4|I've purchased it 2 years back. Still no issues and data transfer speed is fair. Best brand for external hard disks.
2|this product is working fine and up/down speed is good... but sad thing is i purchased this product on high price compare to all other online.... trusting flip kart i purchased on high price but very next day the price got reduced suddenly 1200/-........its very bad... in flip kart.
4|I have been using this product for almost two years now and still it is working perfectly fine. It works very silently and the speed is also awesome. Also the backup software provided is very useful for backing up personal data instantly. My laptop went bad and thanks to this hard disk I was able to retrieve my data as it had been backed up on it. Sincerely I have not been able to find any fault in it even after two years. I would highly recommend this product as it is a great one from Seagate.
2|Been using it since last 1 year and got it replaced from service centre twice for bad transfer speed. I get a max of 45 mbps on usb 3.0. Very bad transfer speed. My WD passport goves me more than 100 mpbs on usb 3.0
5|The body feels a bit fragile but i have dropped it twice and still it has survived . Keep your hard drives cool and do not connect to computer indefinitely for long use
5|Find same HDD in other site 2 years ago , but purchased from flipkart . Work good seems good at genuine price
5|works smoothly with my laptops and pc`s.. i ve been using this product for almost 2 yrs now. and its still very good..
1|I bought this device in febuary 2014 and within 2 months it died. I got a replacement and the replacement died within a month. After that I didn't bother to get another as I thought it will die too and I will loose my data again. I am only writing this review now as I was looking for a new HDD to buy and stumbled upon this, and I don't want others to suffer.
4|good but go for the slim version.this is a good product let me give you the pros and cons PROS:- 1)good speed 2)nice design CONS:- 1)connector may break due to rough usage
1|I bought this HDD on August 2013, after 2 months suddenly it stopped..... I took this to service center, They replaced it and I got a new one... I used both those Hard Disks very carefully.... And again after 7 months My HDD was dead. Full data was lost and when I went to service center again ( it comes with 3 years warranty ) They said that now we cant replace it, If you want to replace it then you have to go to Chennai to get it replaced.... DON'T ever ever buy this product!!!!!!
5|good hard disk.it is still working.works on windows XP,Vista,7,8,8.1 and 10 mac OSX 10.6. it works on linux the box said doesn't compatible with linux.
1|Hi, I have bought thi 1 TB Seagate Backup Plus External Hard Disk from flipark. I'm sure flipkart has done it's best in delivering the product to me at the earliest and it's been an year and I have all the memories and very imporatant files copied to this Hard Disk to keep it as a back up. and all of a sudden it stopped wrking and is not being detected in any of the computers. and Now, I have to get it fixed all by getting it to a service centre with no gaurantee of the data in the hard disk. I would like to share my experience that this Particluar product as this product is to act as a backup in case you hard disk is to go rusty. But, this product it self flawed. Plz don't waste your money and time on this product. I just wish I could find negative rating option.
5|I bought this on sept. 2013. Till now the performance is very good. Good transfer rate. I liked the design too.The main highlight of this model is its "detachable front part".This was very useful for me. Even other SATA Internal hard disks can be connected using this Connector. Very helpful product...When one of my friends laptop internal hard disk fails(OS error cant able to boot), we connected that hard disk using this connector to retrieve the data...... I would really recommend this product...............
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That .

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
1|Guys this hard disk is really a good choice, if you are going to purchase for work purpose.....Thanks to Flipkart for makin available such kind of products on affordable price.
1|Don't ever think about it. I had a worst experience with this hard disk. Every time it will ask for Format the disk. never buy it from Flipkart. U won't get proper response form them also.
2|Slipped from the top of my CPU to the floor (Hardly couple foots distance) and it was inside a sponge cover but still itsnot working anymore. :( Had it only 2 months ago.
1|Backup plus is using samsung hdd inside the cover -- very disappointing. cannot expect this from seagate.(can't they use seagate as we believe seagate and not samsung ) if ever you try to open the cover , will break all the plastic locks of case. and then the warranty become 0. (can not they give user friendly interface to open HDD) the usb 3.0 is very loose , which make loose contact with pc. and HDD partition become RAW(bed partition). disappointed with seagate.
4|Performance is good but there is a big problem with this drive that its not compatible with Ubuntu OS.
1|This is my 2nd hard disk from Seagate. The 1st was FreeAgent Go Flex 500 GB - worked for about 18 months. Developed an adapter problem. Now I bought this 1 Tb 2 months back. IT has probably developed an adapter problem once again. Been going through other reviews - many problems encountered by other users. This warranty thing also sucks. No retrieval of data. Just replacement that too takes about a month. Prefer a Weston HDD. Some of my friends using it. Seagate I have lost trust.
5|I purchased this HDD 3 days ago on 3rd of January and got this today on the 7th. I am impressed by Flipkart's delivery services and pleased to get the purchased item on the given time. Now to the product :) The HDD has beautiful looks , gives a silver colored light when connected ( USB 2.0 ) , sleek and stylish. The data transfer rate is pretty good , 30-35Mbps for USB 2.0 , ( havn't tested with usb3.0 ). It can easily fit into your pocket and well , for extra knowledge about the item , It runs on NTFS which is far more superior than FAT32 ( in my views :P ) The only thing thats a little disappointing is that the length of the cable is pretty short ( 18" ) otherwise , its a fantastic product. A salute to Flipkart and Seagate. This was my first review here on Flipkart. Hope I was useful.
5|I am super impressed with the device and with Flipkart also. Never expected I will get the delivery on a Sunday. I bought a blue 1 TB version and I am liking it. The device is even smaller than the smartphone I am using, not to mention lighter. Before making the purchase, I read the user comments and that's why I was ready to see a small connecting cable. So, finally when I got my hands on the stuff, I found the cable to be fine only. The packaging is just superb. Very glad to have bought this. Definitely recommended.
5|This is my 3rd product frm flipkart. awesome punctuality. apart frm this. product is very gud. you hav 931 GB. 4 videos abt seagate dashboard. this s 4 automatic backup. very stylish. 100% trusty nd worthy. if u go 4 1tb hd this s d best nd finest choice. thq.
1|I bought this hdd on 15th October 2013.I connected the Hdd and was getting ready to backup my data and since I was a first time user I left the HDD connected and opened up the seagate dashboard running after setting up the back up plan and kept the computer on for the whole day. Evenibg when I came back to check the backup done to my surprise the back did not start as there was an initial job pending error. I tried contacting customer care but they are closef all the time even in business hours.Aftet trying multiple times I was able to get touch with the cust care rep. He sent me a file which contained outdated SW called seagate manager which was able to back up my PC data but was not able to bakup my facebook data. Today i 've been struggling to get in touch with the cx care rep since the ladt 10 days and still the offices are closed. I don't know who will be able to help me. If someone has a resolution for initial job pending error please help.
1|The external hard disk I received has really disappointed me. The data transfer speed is less than my pen drive. I have just wasted my money on this. Think before you buy this product. Flipkart has really annoyed me.
1|its really one of the worst product from seagate its really horrible i had brought it in other website its not at all detecting by my laptop watse of money useless product all my data lost and service from seagate is really pathetic please dnt buy it ull face the trouble..!!1
2|First of all,hats off delivery executive and packing...as always B4 TIME. I am little abset about the price bcoz i book the product when it was 6.7k but now they reduced to 5,650/-...anyway worth to purchase. Bcoz i had waited 8-10 months for reducing the prices. Now, i will tell u abt the product. Cable around 18'' black USB 3.0...also support on USB 2.0 Light weight..black surface...loks NICE Now, abt SPEED.... I have USB 2.0 system,i MOVED(not copied) 12.7 GB data at a time and it took around 13-14 mins @ 13-14 MB/sec....But COPIED 3.91 GB video data @ 25-30 MB/sec in 3-4 mins.......wht more i can say(Laughs) SO, let me test some more days and i will write my next review very soon......Thnaks...........@:@
1|FLIPKART IS A CHEATER NOW AS THEY CAN NOT FULLFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS AND TRY TO FOOL PEOPLE THEY SAY FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU HAVE PURCHASED 11 HARD DISK I GUESS FLIPKART BUYS HARD DISK TO USE AS TOILET PAPER.THEY CALL AND SAY YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN CONFIRMEND BUT NOT APPROVED WHICH ACCORDING TO ANY PERSON WHO IS SANE MEANS THE SAME OOHH SORRY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SANE PEOPLE NOT FLIPKART EMPLOYEES FOR THEM IT DOES NOT MEAN THE SAME.A BIG FAT CHEAT FLIPKART.
5|I just received my order. i was very excited while unpacked the parcel. However, all excitement was turned into disappointment when i connected the hard drive to my laptop. It says it is 1 TB backup plus.. But it did not have 1024 GB space.. I only can see 931 GB space capacity.. Really i am shocked to see that i have been robbed of almost 70 GB space... yet to check other features... seriously...can anyone tell me ... what happened to the rest of the space... had it been max 10 GB space i would have compromised on the same. but it is too much to convince myself.. checked on the internet. about the space in any hard disk of 1 TB. used it for a month and found it to be exceptionally good with no heating problems. It is quite robust as i dropped it couple of times and still working... lol.. full marks to hard disk company and extra marks for Flip Kart to deliver it in stipulated time...
4|This disk have good data transfer rate and does not get hot in a continuous long time use. Also it is very robust, by mistake it was felled by me from around 6 feet 2 times but it only opened and after just fitting it is working fine, good job Seagate, only the problem is of very short USB cable and it is of special type, so rare chance to get same type of long cable, here improvement is required from Seagate. Over all it is good and go for it.
5|I preferred this over WD and i am bery much happy till date. The transfer speed is very good both in USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 My cable has went down to be little loose after 1 and 1/2 years of use but that too because of soo much rough use. I would say Seagate provide the best HD drives in the world. WD is good but i would prefer Seagate coz i had used both of them and found Seagate to be more efficient and friendly. Dont go on some losers writing false and foolish review about Seagate. A must buy in external series.
2|I bought this External HDD, It broke 2 times in 3 years, although the seagate warranty got it covered but anyways I lost all my data. Not recommended.
5|this product is realy good. USB cable that comes with it is short. But its good speed to move files and Well suitabe for PCs too.
2|you see the two piece construction, it got loose first, & then it finally broke the link cuz of the looseness, so i had to buy & install the BUS which joins a hard disk to USB. and who goes to service centre for a harddisk, seagate is best just dont buy this model
4|I've purchased it 2 years back. Still no issues and data transfer speed is fair. Best brand for external hard disks.
2|this product is working fine and up/down speed is good... but sad thing is i purchased this product on high price compare to all other online.... trusting flip kart i purchased on high price but very next day the price got reduced suddenly 1200/-........its very bad... in flip kart.
4|I have been using this product for almost two years now and still it is working perfectly fine. It works very silently and the speed is also awesome. Also the backup software provided is very useful for backing up personal data instantly. My laptop went bad and thanks to this hard disk I was able to retrieve my data as it had been backed up on it. Sincerely I have not been able to find any fault in it even after two years. I would highly recommend this product as it is a great one from Seagate.
2|Been using it since last 1 year and got it replaced from service centre twice for bad transfer speed. I get a max of 45 mbps on usb 3.0. Very bad transfer speed. My WD passport goves me more than 100 mpbs on usb 3.0
5|The body feels a bit fragile but i have dropped it twice and still it has survived . Keep your hard drives cool and do not connect to computer indefinitely for long use
5|Find same HDD in other site 2 years ago , but purchased from flipkart . Work good seems good at genuine price
5|works smoothly with my laptops and pc`s.. i ve been using this product for almost 2 yrs now. and its still very good..
1|I bought this device in febuary 2014 and within 2 months it died. I got a replacement and the replacement died within a month. After that I didn't bother to get another as I thought it will die too and I will loose my data again. I am only writing this review now as I was looking for a new HDD to buy and stumbled upon this, and I don't want others to suffer.
4|good but go for the slim version.this is a good product let me give you the pros and cons PROS:- 1)good speed 2)nice design CONS:- 1)connector may break due to rough usage
1|I bought this HDD on August 2013, after 2 months suddenly it stopped..... I took this to service center, They replaced it and I got a new one... I used both those Hard Disks very carefully.... And again after 7 months My HDD was dead. Full data was lost and when I went to service center again ( it comes with 3 years warranty ) They said that now we cant replace it, If you want to replace it then you have to go to Chennai to get it replaced.... DON'T ever ever buy this product!!!!!!
5|good hard disk.it is still working.works on windows XP,Vista,7,8,8.1 and 10 mac OSX 10.6. it works on linux the box said doesn't compatible with linux.
1|Hi, I have bought thi 1 TB Seagate Backup Plus External Hard Disk from flipark. I'm sure flipkart has done it's best in delivering the product to me at the earliest and it's been an year and I have all the memories and very imporatant files copied to this Hard Disk to keep it as a back up. and all of a sudden it stopped wrking and is not being detected in any of the computers. and Now, I have to get it fixed all by getting it to a service centre with no gaurantee of the data in the hard disk. I would like to share my experience that this Particluar product as this product is to act as a backup in case you hard disk is to go rusty. But, this product it self flawed. Plz don't waste your money and time on this product. I just wish I could find negative rating option.
5|I bought this on sept. 2013. Till now the performance is very good. Good transfer rate. I liked the design too.The main highlight of this model is its "detachable front part".This was very useful for me. Even other SATA Internal hard disks can be connected using this Connector. Very helpful product...When one of my friends laptop internal hard disk fails(OS error cant able to boot), we connected that hard disk using this connector to retrieve the data...... I would really recommend this product...............
1|This is a bad harddisk. I am never buying Seagate again. Like everyone else the led blinks for couple of seconds and the disk spins and then nothing...
4|First off i bought this hard drive from flipkart 2 years back. Warning is that it is extremely delicate and unstable physically so be careful using it. Next the transfer speeds are fantastic no worries about technical point of view-5400 RPM USB 3 and others. The downside is the price , Rs. 5700 is a bit too much , but the other alternative is a Toshiba or a Dell. If anything happens to the hard drive there is a pretty bad service issue , getting it repaired is a big pain in the neck. But overall good product
4|First of all, good service from Flipkart. It was my first online shopped item. The product? Its elegant in design, pleasant and appealing. Performance was good, I bought it more than 14 months before writing this. Although now its full and hence become slow but was that's because I bloated it. Otherwise, this a great device. Plus, an advantage is you detach the USB-to-SATA plug and use it with other drives (I used it for my laptop's internal hard disk when it was corrupted to recover data). But that can be irritating also as it makes the device more fragile. On the negative side, the port has become loose pretty early than other hard disks I have seen. Rest, a nice device. Recommendable.
1|since the day i am using this product, its highly troublesome lost huge data as it requires format once u plug out accidentally without safe removal not a good plug n play external HDD and now the drive is not detecting at all its still under 3yr warranty kindly anyone help me for replacement
5|I bought this hdd in 2013 at a price of 4500 rupees . After a year and half i am very happy with this product.It has good built quality and has given me persistent performance. Read an write speeds on usb 2.0 are nearly 34Mbps . Bought this from WS retail and got 3 year warranty from the date i purchased this item....so don't worry about warranty related problems.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1. USB cable is very short. 2. Drive activity indicator is not very noticeable. It only changes light intensity. But most people are familiar with the changing blinking rate of the LED. But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference. (Collapse)
1|It has been around 1 year since I have purchased Seagatre external hard disk. Initially after receiving hard disk from flipcart i got the defective piece. After so much of struggle finally i was able to replace it with a new hard disk. The new hard disk was ok. After transferring my data to new hard disk , I formatted my laptop to upgade the operator. When I connected hard disk to my laptop it was again not working. Now i am unable to get back my data.
2|died after 1 month and even seagate is not accepting it claiming it to be counterfiting case....... only th e light flashes for sometime and then it does not shows up no spinning no nothing
5|Nice HDD. Using it for more than 2 year. Works well; no issues till date. Thanks to flipkart I got it at Rs.4099 which costs more than 5k in other retailer's shop.
5|Met expectation. The Hard drive was delivered well in time. Flexible design for connecting various adapters.
5|I have bought this product 3 days ago but not through Flipcart. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports.And they do not give any pouch or cover but you can also buy one outside. It does not have a shiny plastic but has a good matte finish. But one the sides it has a scratch prone plastic, so better to buy a pouch to protect your beautiful device. Pros: 1)You get 930 Gb. 2)Matte like finish to prevent scratches. 3)It does not become hot even after hours of usage. 4)Good read/write speed of 20/mbps on my USB 2.0. Cons: 1)The USB Cable is very short, if you are using a desktop try a different hard drive. I bought it for Rs.5,600 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive. If you're looking for a 1 Tb hard drive for a laptop for heavy usage, i suggest you to get this one.
5|PROs: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish. 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 95 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Although prices are not like it was 9 months ago, still it is a good bargain at 5700/- rather than going for other drives at 6000+ bucks. 4. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 5. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. 6. The older SeaGate GoFlex adapters is also fully compatible with it. CONs: 1.

But it's a personal choice of course. 3. Not military grade drop tested like the IoMega eGo and Transcend StoreJet. But no issues as it is also your personal choice and pricing difference.
5|Ordered the blue color model of this HDD for 5245 on 27th oct. Got it in 2 days thanks to quick flipkart self delivery. Coming to the drive, have used it for 5 days and quite happy with it's performance. Pros- 1) Stays cool for long hours 2) Very Silent 3) Good read & write speeds (20-30 MBps on usb 2.0, dont have a 3.0 port so cant say about that) 4) Cool looks (Matte finish) 5) Seagate Dashboard software is good. Cons- 1) Short cable (but enough for a laptop) 2) Scratch prone (Pouch required for protection) 3) LED indicator light does not blink when data transfer is ongoing. But pros definitely outweigh the cons. Good drive for this amount of money. Best in class. Definitely recommended.
1|SEAGATE is always awesome.. I had bad experience with my WD 320 GB HD before.. therefore I thought to get 1TB of SEAGATE.. and i was right, the HD is great. It's Stylish, Sleek, [Though wire is little short].. BUT anyway ..IT's the best. NO NEED to comment on FLIPKART DELIVERY.. It's always AWESOME. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- above is my review given to this product when i bought it... now after using it for 9 Months...I'm getting to know the reality of this product. 1. Read all 1 Star Reviews for this product & you will find the same story everywhere - THIS HDD stops working after some time... somebody sees it aftet 2-3 months..and other's a little later...but ultimately..it's fate is same.. It will die before it's so called '5years' warranty. a> White LED light keeps on blinking. b> HDD not detected on computer (not in Device Manager, not in Disk management & not in explorer) c> NO option from Seagate for recovering of the data. d> they will probably replace your HDD (but the new one will also die)...and no recovering. another IMPORTANT thing - ''It is a PRODUCT OF CHINA'' (Read the info given on back of your HDD) ONE request : PLZ don't buy Seagate HDDs (not even internals) and if you already have one..and it's working fine..PLZ save your ''important'' data somewhere safe (online data services)
1|The Hard drive was delivered well in time ... all was going vanilla and one day ... the drive died ... not when i plug it in ... light flashes and shows nothing in my computer ... i plugged it in multiple laptops ... NOTHING . . . light flashes for a min... and the dat dies too .... flipkart says ... they cant help as its past 30 days already and they asked me to contact Segate itself.... ill update my review after segate's response....
1|i hv purchased it with very happy mind ... n i was so careful about it . i lv everything about it. its color, its 1 tb space . n its speed to copy as it is usb 3.0 capable. bt one good day become the worst day of my life because of this.. when i cut n paste all my data frm lappee to this.. sometime it behave like a gd girl bt one day it become unaccessible. i was totally shocked bcoz all my sweet memories were there in it. i rush to serviced center.. they say we can only replace for free.. cant recover data.. n in market their is min. charges is 25000. that was nt possible for me. n i hv to replace it wd heavy heart. its nt happen only wd me . its happen wd many people. i was unaware abt this. now pls take care before purchase this. u will never know why this is not functioning. its stop suddenly . thanks to read
5|Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
1|I bought seagate HDD through flipkart around June timeframe. When I got the HDD, I was so happy with the sleek model and the speed. The reason why I had ordered seagate 1TB HDD is that, my 500 GB HDD is not detected by any computer. I lost all my data in that and I copied whatever possible data is present in my laptop is copied into the new 1TB new HDD ordered through flipkart. My happiness was only for shortspan of 1 month, as the new one also stopped getting detected by any computer. I have heard through my friends that, after seagate upgraded to optical technology, there any many problems reported and it has become highly unreliable. In my previous company also, there were problems with our high-end servers which has seagate hard-disks. I really regret buying seagate HDD as I lost all the data twice. They say, they will give replacement of both HDDs as they both are in warranty, but who will give me the data back? I dont not even want to give a single-star rating. I would not recommend buying seagate HDD.
5|I received it today and it is great. I have four other External HDs and two of them are Seagate. This one so far has the coolest looks. Works quietly and the port is a three-in-one to which three different types of adapters can be connected. Softwares are good for back-up, though the cover claims facebook, which I haven't tried yet, and am not sure will do in future. The looks are great. The Blue wood-ish texture is great and it is well protected with a fine film, you can choose to peel or not. The sides and the backs come laminated and the lamination is so neat that I do not want to take it out. The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. Flipkart self-delivery has improved a lot. Before, there was a little amount of ambiguity with the Courier companies, now with Flipkart self-delivery it is flawless. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|I bought from Flipkart, as usual no compliant on deliveries, I got it in two days. It was working for last 4 months perfectly. But after some time suddenly it starts blinking and my Laptop/TV couldn't recognize this properly. When I searched for the internet I found that most of the people has this problem and the support team response was horrible. I would suggest people to read their support forum before buy this. I couldn't post the exact link here.Please search google "Backup Plus Blinking Light" and look into the first link. Please read this before buy. Now I am planning to go to their warranty process. I will update that experience soon.
4|Though I didn't bought it from flipkart....still a really good product and really happy with it... Pro's.... High speed Matte Finish Good price Cons.... Led should be more clear while transferring and it should turn to blue when it's connected to usb 3.0
1|It was great for about a month and suddenly one day, it wasn't recognized either by the explorer or by the disk management. The light stops glowing and the disk is not detected. I tried it in different computers on different ports and with a different USB cable, nothing helped. Seagate was great once, but now, it's not worth it's name.
1|The drive worked very well for 11 months. Didn't heat up and all..I bought it from flipkart. But now suddenly it stopped working. The computer detects the drive as some unknown but cannot open it. Tried with 3 computers.. same result. The one star is for the 11 months.
5|received in 3 days only..! amazing service didn't expect such fast service. about product..speed is awesome, small,handy,excellent color...! The packaging was very good inside the Seagate box and outside it too. Flipkart as usual is great with delivery. This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast. yeah,dis is one awesom portable drive, much smaller dan all other portable drives,lighter too, luks nice,received d same drive as shown in d pic , works pretty perfect , best buy for a dis price, flipkart is bcoming a bit faster.
1|This is second time i had given the order but this time they are sanded damaged one.Can you please do the needful.
5|Thanks to flipkart for delivered the drive with in 3 days of order. look and feel is very awesome,especial silver and white combination giving to a beautiful and silky look. firmware/Dash board like as auto backup,instance photo sharing to social networking site is really nice options. and its has the compatibility of USB 2.0 also(TESTED) I bought it for Rs.5,900 which is a good price for a 1 TB Hard drive with 3 month EMI option only of INR100/- EMI charges. apart from its available 3 more stunning colors of Black,Read and blue. Highly Recommended.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: you will get hassle-free data backup and very good durability at cheap rate. If you are using your hard disk very frequently then WD hard disk should not be your choice. But if you just want to backup your internal hard disk data to the external hard drive and want a good looking handy hard drive then go for WD hard disk. Thanks for reading this review and I think this will help you to choose your hard disk and for their maintenance.
5|The Best Hard Disk ever from a brand like Seagate..... I purchased it at an affordable price of Rs. 4450/-, the lowest price of Seagate Backup Plus 1TB so far on flipkart or any other online shopping site..... It comes with a huge storage capacity of 931 GB with a data transfer speed of about 25 MBPS for USB 2.0. But this speed depends on the amount of data, the type of USB port & type of data that is transferred...... I bought the Black color HDD & I recommend to go for the Black color rather than spending a lot of money to get the colored (Blue, Red, Silver) piece of the same Hard Disk..... Now, talking about the size of the HDD, it fits easily in ones pocket. Its got a white LED as well to show the HDD activity. But it does not blink at all, rather it only changes light intensity...... Data cable length is short & is a bit of concern for Desktop Users & not an issue for Laptop Users. Only thing to worry from my point of view is that it gets slightly heated after hours of usage & data transfer...... Apart from this the HDD is less noisy compared to others & it also has 3 years of warranty from Seagate...... Besides all these flipkart's timely delivery & packing was awesome. A must buy External Hard Disk from Seagate.......
2|So for the first 6 months, the hard drive worked like a dream but then all of a sudden it stopped working. The activity light kept blinking and no computer could detect the device. Furthermore, I discovered that the serial number on the device did not match the serial number on the detect device window on my computer. My data is gone and I am not sure if I'll get a replacement. Also, the service center in Mumbai is difficult to find. So the next time, invest a little more time and buy electronics directly from a store instead of online.
1|About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. Somehow manage to find the service center and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product. I Am having 2 1tb external hard disk 1 is Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB 2 is Seagate Expansion 1 TB
1|Its one of the worst product to go for.... Best thing : amazing Service from Flipkart. About the product : the product is made of cheap material which can break very easily. I bought this product in October 2012. just within a month I had format it twice (that can be understood). but just few days back it stopped working I mean the any of my Laptop was not able to read it. If you mail the service center they don respond back. somehow manage to find the service center which is almost the other side of city and the only option they had was to Replace and that too is taking month......plus " sorry we cannot retrieve your Data" And its so called Backup software doesn't help I would say Seagate may be master in external Hard disk but their services are pathetic. and this is one of their worst Product.
1|I planned to purchase this hard disk and its price is 4099. At payment page i could not pay due to OTP delay. Then i tried to pay again but i got error message that product is out of stock. Again i searched the product, i shocked to see the price went to 5500. i could not believe the within 1 min flipkart increased its price by 1500. And again after few min its price was at 4099 then i clicked buy button. Again i shocked to see its price was 5500 in digital cart. i totally upset about continuous changing price for the product. After few min its price was 4999. Price can be changed within 1 day or week but changing price 4 times within few min cant be tolerated. flipkart increase product price more than MRP and giving 20% discount. This is totally unacceptable. In flipkart products and services are good but still it have few drawbacks.
1|I was visiting Lucknow from 10th to 20th October so thought to order this product at my Lucknow residence. The committed delivery time was within 2-3 days (19th Oct for me). I was keeping a track of the updates and saw them mentioning as "Item Shipped" on 16th October, i.e. on same day of ordering. The last update from Flipkart was done on 17th Oct at around 2:08pm saying its being dispatched from Delhi transport hub. Today is 19th Oct. and not a single update has been done even since. I called them during afternoon time and I was told parcel has reached Lucknow and was confirmed a delivery in the evening by 7pm. At 7:20pm also when I did not get any parcel delivered, I called again and they told due to some courier problem the update could not be made and delivery did not happen. I have to return back to Chennai on 20th Oct noon and these people talk about delivering the parcel to Lucknow address by 21st Oct. WHAT THE HELL!!! Flipkart is known for their prompt delivery time and such kind of act of delay is STRICTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Being a customer I will never accept any reason for delay or else you do not make a committment of 2-3 days. I would not have risked paying Rs. 4300 for the hard-disk and got it delivered at my Lucknow home if little did I know Flipkart would have done like this. I have been ordering from Flikart since past 2 years and never has such a thing happened. I am worried about my refund or parcel delivery now.
1|This harddisk is from seagate, so you can rely on it. But there are two main and important feature which this hard disk is lacking, namely "Usefull indicator light" and "Standy by". Older model of seagate with name "Seagte 1TB expansion Portable Drive" was having these features and newer model "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk" might have(99% sure, it will have) these feature. Indicator Light Feature - Newer and older 1TB drive both have indicator light, but behavior is different. In older model, during file copy, indicator light blinks fast and in standby mode, it blinks slowly. In this model, during file copy, indicator light just changes light intensity, which you can notice only with great concentration and there is no standby mode. Standby Feature - This is very very important feature as it is related to long life of the hard drive. In older 1TB model, there is feature that, if you there is no activity related to hard disk for 5-10 minutes, hard drive motor stops itself (standby mode) and waits for next activity and upon any hard disk activity, it starts itself. In this model, there is no standby feature. But "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk " must be supporting this feature. For e.g. if you you are copying 15 GB of movie to portable hard disk, it will take 15 min approx in USB 2.0 and a few minute in USB 3.0. Suppose you forgot to pullout hard drive for 8-10 hours. In this model, hard disk motor will keep on revolving for 8-10 hours. In older 1TB model and might be in "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk", after completion of file copy, hard disk motor will stop and goes to stand by after 5 minutes of no activity. So in short, this model will have life less than "Seagate Expansion Falcun 1 TB External Hard Disk".
1|My personal experience with Seagate is very poor. I have used the free agent Go passport. It worked really well for 9-10 months then stopped working on windows XP & lower versions. it worked on windows Vista for few days & then crashed. All my data was lost as the Customer service refused to recover the lost data. I was dissapointed by the loss but i was for yet another surprise, my elder brother had also bought the same model as did few of my friends and each of them faced similar problem, their HDD crashed after 10-12 months. It was surprising since it was the most expensive HDD in the market, with 5 years warranty. I have still not found any friend whose Seagate HDD survived more than 15 months, till now 12 HDD have crashed. Personally i want to give them 0 but i am forced to give atleast 1 star so don't be decieved, Do not buy Seagate unless you only want to store some movies & not any important data. you may get good warranty, speed but at the cost of unreliability & all your data may be lost any time. I also request each & every person to provide the reviews life & performance after few months. As far as seagate is concerned none of my friends or me will ever buy one despite any review or good ratings.
5|I desperately needed a new HDD to back up my ever increasing data stored in my lappy{I already have a portable seagate 320 GB HDD(3+ years old) still going good without any problems(checked with software HDD contorl2 from ashampoo)} So this time decided to go line to purchase a new one. The Seagate portable HDD came in a good package and at right time through blue dart couriers The Seagate drive is quite pockety and came with a nice looking carry case. The best part of this drive is - it has option for 3 types of data cables 1) USB 3.0 (bundled)(compatible with any USB2.0 port) 2) firewire 800(for mac users-sold seperately) 3)Thunderbolt (sold seperately-future proof-in future intel will include it) and also the provided back up software is pretty good, simple to use (u can back up, download and upload pictures and videos from/to social networking sites easily) Now coming to real world performance it is as good as other premium portable HDD's finally about flipkart i have to say few words I am from a small city in Karnataka In the past one year I have purchased many gadgets from this site. Their customer service is superb (even i had cancelled a few products-and they refunded the money without any issue but takes some time)
5|I needed an external HDD for my dell inspiron. so , i went thru many web sources in search of a durable, fast and outstanding performing HDD. The two choices which i found up to the mark(quality) were Seagate backup plus and WD My passport ext hdd. On contacting my local area electronics shops(Naza market Lko) I found Seagate as the best choice. Moreover they told me that go for backup plus and buy a thunderbolt data cable for superfast transfer speeds. So i preferred Seagate backup plus to WD and Dell HDDs, and ordered one. Now i've been using it since 3 months and am totally happy wid it. Go For It!! As it was my first online order so i was expecting it would take some 4-5 days to deliver. But, thanks to flipkart's Xpress delivery(thats wht i wud call it :) ), it took only 2 days to be handed over to me. Overall experience:- product quality: 10/10. packing of product: 10/10 delivery: blazing :) 3g speed. (y)
3|The hard disk is look wise very nice and work wise its really nice but the problem will create in this disk when the bad sector problem may occur in future and you will loose all your data and Seagate only replace this disk if the disk will in warranty. Then you will have to search a local recovery shop in the IT market and you will have to take approval from Seagate to recover the data from local shops or companies like Steller recovery. These recovery may cost you very high. So I will suggest you just if you are purchasing this product, just use this hard disk only to copy data but not for saving the data. If you wanna save your data then use DVDs only.
5|This is one of the good storage device , work with XP SP 2 as well , although product specification state compatibility with SP3 I got transfer speed upto 40 MBPS on Win 7 with USB 3.0 Pros: 930 GB out of 1TB usable stylish look does not get heat up after several hours of use Cons: should be provided with a cover or pouch
3|Seagate Hard Disk Is a Best Hard Disk . Please Do Not Buy For Online Product For Flipkart. Please Purchase For Seagate Brabded Store Buy................................................................................................................................................
5|Used this HDD for about 3 months. So its the time to write the review as I have had enough time to test it. LOOKS & BUILT: => Brilliant aesthetic looks with brushed metal finish => Lighter and compact than other 1Tb hard-drives (comapred to Transcend 1 TB Portable HDD,Seagate Expansion Portable 1 TB and Seagate Free Agent GoFlex 1TB) FEATURES: => Dashboard Software really works well and easy to use. It offers 3 features namely 1) Protect - Lets you backup your data from other sources with different backup plans 2) Share - Lets you share picture and videos with Facebook & Flickr. 3) Save - Lets you backup your picture and videos from Facebook & Flickr. => Compatible with following adapters FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 PERFORMANCE: (tested with USB2.0 only) => So far transferred over TBs of data through it. => Getting stable speed of 18-19 Mbps(video files) and 12-15Mbps(pictures and documents) from other external HDD to this one => From computer drive to Seagate backup plus, getting constant speed of 25Mbps PROS: => Almost everything about it - Its Fast, Sleek, Compact, Light-weight, Good looking, Seagate's trust. Cons: (as few may find) =>Shorter cable (not and issue if you have a USB hub or an extender) =>Plastic chassis (depends on you how you keep it safe, dropped mine from bed few times) =>"Protect" feature is not Mac compatible MY VERDICT: If you want a 1Tb portable hard drive go for - Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB, Trust me you won't repent a bit PS: Got its Black color for 4950/- + Free leather case from Seagate as Diwali 2012 offer price went up in between but again 5095 is a killer deal I think.
5|I got this at a very good price during diwali sale. The product is really good. USB 3.0 is awesome. I had read speed of 100 MByte/Sec (copied 700mb file in 7sec) The write speed was consistent 65MByte/Sec I am having an asus laptop with usb 3.0 this goes very well with it. There are other features like facebook data backup, but I haven't used it so far.
5|I received the product within 4 days of flipkart delivery date well in time. This product of seagate costs Rs.1000 more if puchased from outside. It is sleek, stylish and most of all has a scratch resistant finish. It gives speed of about 91 Mbps in USB 3.0 which is a very good speed for data transfer. I suggest it a awesome product at such a reasonable rate.
5|Seagate has always been one of the best in hard drive technology. I'm sure you will never regret buying this product from flipkart. I enjoy using Seagate because it is terribly fast. Moreover Seagate packs this product in a very safe way. Though I have a U.S.B 2.0 Port, it works fantabulously fast!!!!! -Special Features:::: -The Backup Plus portable drive from Seagate is the simple way to protect and share your entire digital lifewithout getting in the way of the rest of your life. -Backup Plus also lets you link your Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube accounts directly to your drive, making sharing and protecting things online easier than ever before. -Sleek, portable design. -Protect your stuff with easy, flexible backups. -Automatically save photos from your social networks. -Share photos and videos to social networks with a click. -Keep your stuff safe anywhere. USB power means it requires no external power source. -Easily increase transfer speeds by upgrading to Thunderbolt. technology or FireWire 800.
5|I was initially skeptical aobut getting a Seagate product since I usually rely on WD. But after many recommendations and reviews from PCMag and cnet, I finally decided to get one. 1. It's sleek and trendy. 2. Has a simple interface. 3. Never gets too hot. 4. The Dashboard is reliable to the end. 5. Offers great speeds on USB 3.0 and 2.0. 6. The black one comes with a limited edition Seagate original leather pouch, which comes in really handy for travelling with it. 7. It is ULTRA light. I really loved this item, I strongly recommend it. Flipkart home delivery system is fantastic as usual, I recieved the product within three days. I would advice everyone to get the black one since the other models are a bit unstable I've heard. Happy storing guys, you're at the right place, do not get your decisions clogged by the way it looks, check the specs. And go for a Seagate rather than a WD.
5|I ordered it few days back.. and was shocked... next day i got the Hard Disk... Hard Disk is also very fast in copying and downloading Data. Got leather pouch free with it SUPERB SERVICE FROM FLIPKART... KEEP IT UP Rahul Bhatkar
4|Got the hd within 2 days of ordering !! kudos filpkart for prompt delivery ,.. About the HDD .. its sleek and compact compared to the other models in its price range .. and also though its body is plastic the finish is matte and less finger print friendly ... but buying a case for it is necessary .. the transfer speed is between 20-25 mbps on usb 2.0 port using the normal cable ... the preloaded software is also quite useful ... i think flipkart should put a case for optional xtra and a long usb extension the one which comes with the drive is really small !! in short is value for money ...
4|I have been using Seagate products for last 15 years starting with my first PC. I also have 500GB (not from flipkart) that i bought 2 years ago, which is running absolutely fine. Pros: 1) Huge space for storage for HD videos. 2) cost per GB is around 6 Rs or less. This is way too low as compared flash drive, around 30 Rs. 3) Good transfer speeds. (USB 2.0) 24MB/s sustained and 32MB/s bust,for real life practical purpose. Not tested for 3.0 yet. 4) Drive looks are great, "apple" white color scheme, sleek slim shell. Cons: 1) Drive side USB connector is mounted on separate panel(one, you can see as thin line across the body of the drive). This part is plastic-y and seems little weak. 2) USB connector grip on the drive side is little weak as well, it tends to get loose and may come out with little more moving around. PS: Again flipkart guys are best! deliverary was neat and superfast, with safe COD option. Thanks!
5|I bought this hard disk a few weeks back from flipkart. Pros: 1. The USB 3.0 gives blazing fast performance and transfer speeds. (Make sure your computer supports USB 3.0). 2. I also got a leather pouch for free along with this hard disk (it was a limited offer). And it is really convenient. 3. The metal finish on the surface of the hard disk gives it a really fine look. 4. The size of the hard disk is small, and fits comfortable even in a jeans pocket. 5. The hard disk seems durable and tough enough to survive any accidental falls. Cons: 1. The seagate backup software provided, although non-intrusive, is completely unnecessary. A part of the cost we pay for the hard disk goes to the development of that seagate software that nobody uses. 2. The minimum cloud storage given for "free" along with the hard disk is not a lot. You could get more from dropbox, skydrive, amazon cloud, etc. A part of the cost of the hard disk is this "free" cloud storage. 3. The flipkart delivery system has become more chaotic than it was before.
1|If my words make any difference... Don't buy anything from Seagate...Its for your own good. One of my HDDs crashed within a year and the replacement crashed within two months of being replaced. The main problem is the data that is lost. Seagate takes enormous time to sought an issue and in case they replace your hard disk, that too is a repaired one and has a considerable chance of turning out wrong. The Company service may be good. But the product service is terrible.
1|total connectivity problems auto disconnect when data transfer problems regarding reconnect after loss connection connection problem from one pc to another pc or laptop performance good but what abt connection it is loss every time wn u touch ur hard disk all over third class
1|I bought this hard drive to store movie files so I can connect it to the tv and watch them. This drive only allows exFAT or NTFS. Mac doesn't read NTFS and the Samsung tv doesn't read exFAT. So I'm stuck with 1TB of space to store doc files. Thank you Seagate!
1|Flipkart has failed miserably to deliver this product on time. After promising delivery is 3 working days, even 7 days later it seems even difficult. In fact it takes these guys 3 days to identify where the product is. These guys had no clue on what condition they were going to get the product to me. Even after sorting out a cancellation, these guys find reasons such as servers to do not work and all those sorts. NOW, a week after the order I don't have my money nor the product. Overall I felt flipkart had a glitch free service till now, and after a year long relationship these guys have let me down big time You could be next! All the best.
1|A year and a month after I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart (and I'd been using it regularly ever since), I connected it to my laptop, only to find that out of 5 partitions, I could see only three. And after clicking on any folder within these three 'visible' drives, I got an error message saying '...error: couldn't find the specified path' or something such. I tried copying whatever little I could to another hard drive, and I got another error that read : 'CRC error. Cannot copy.' Tried connecting it to a different laptop, to my TV, but all in vain. The service center guys aren't receiving my calls. I have no darned clue what to do next!
5|As usual light speed delivery. Got it within 2 days after ordering. Flipkart rocks both in delivery and neat packaging. Silver - White combination is looking great. And its very cute. Pros. 1. You will get 931 GB. Inside you will find some softwares. Take a backup and go for an NTFS format(since FAT32 wont support file size more than 4GB). 2. Amazing speed. Tested with USB 3.0 + tera copy (60-80MBps). 3. Amazing Look. 4. Wont get heated up too much. Cons. 1. Connector not much impressive. But Ok. Overall a great product from Seagate(5/5) and Flipkart service awesome(5/5). Highly recommended.
5|For third time product gets delivered earlier than said by flipkart. Well packed and wrapped. Hard drive is very compact and very handy. It has good transfer speed not best. with 2.0 -> 20-30 MBPS and with 3.0 -> 50-60 MBPS (for movies) Hard drive can be upgraded further by changing cable. For facebook users and those who keeps important data arranged in computer can use automatic backup feature. Go for it..!
5|First, kudos to Flipkart for awesome packaging with re-usable air pillow inside. The drive is par excellence and slimmer than GoFlex. Connecting adapter design is simply great, I can use it with the connector of GoFlex as well. Transfer speed is good averaging 40Mbps (as shown in Tera Copy).
5|Flipkart has delivered the product within 4 days of placing the order. After i open, this HD is good looking with shining red color and small in size. Although the data cable connector is different from the earlier seagate HDs, but what makes this HD special is that its design is perfect with optimal cost compared to other 1TB HDs.
5|It is a new Generation of Seagate Portable Drive -Design of Drive is Very Good -Read and Write Speed is Good, around 30MB/Sec on USB 2.0 Windows 7 -Total Space around 931 GB -Backup Dashboard Software is Very Nice USB Cable is average ,not so Good.
1|hello guys..... i bought this Seagate External HDD back up plus 1TB in a very good hope of getting it in time and no issues with the delivery because the package was coming from a very distant city.... as my package arrived my wait was finally over and i was really excited........ and then when i open it i see what the seller tried to do.... he sent me an external HDD but it was not the one i ordered... in fact it was a cheaper one ... the only difference was the name... the one i ordered was Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk and they thought we were customers who don't know how to make out a difference and sent me Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1 TB External Hard Disk........ now if i wasn't there and my dad or someone quite old like my dad would have been there alone he wouldn't even have found out the difference.... this is where i wanna let you all that the seller known as GemsLaptopGallery is not paying proper attention and is trying to fool the customer and even flipkart because this really isn't flipkart's fault...... i warn you that whenever you wanna buy such an electronic item you have to make sure that the seller is genuine and not new....
1|mine has taken 10 months to break down, maybe due to less use. The light just blinks and the drive doesn't show on the Mac. The Serial No. on the Flipkart invoice is different from whats on the drive casing and NEITHER works on Seagate's website when applying for replacement. seems its going to be customer-care nightmare call after all. Very worried now about the 2TB i use to back-up my work on. my ancient Lacie still work like a charm. Time to junk Seagate before all is lost
1|look at da price! lol i seen 1st time dat some one selling HHD RS 1 hahahaha .. Go home you are drunk bro ..
2|it is really tough to get customer support from segate . all the number are isd even they does not answer throuh mail properly . better buy western digital . i am suffering with segate from past 1 months .
1|Just recently bought the hard disk 1 tb. It was worked only 2 days. After that stopped working from today. I tried connecting on different laptop and tv. But not working..
2|I purchased this hard disk from flipkart, it reached my home on time. The software that Seagate provides with this product, to manage your backed up files and their new versions seems not to work properly. what happened with me is, that Seagate software created folders after folders on the external hard disk and finally it could not access and restore my files because the length of file path exceeded Windows 7's capability. Luckily I survived with my data (the original copy on my system). I tried 3-4 times to find if I was making some mistake, but no, the software was faulty. Finally I had to use it like a BIG PENDRIVE. Few days later I had to format my system so my original files were deleted, and all my data was in this hard disk. And cherry on the top, the hard disk CRASHED, my new disk CRASHED and every thing GONE. Seagate's data recovery charges are too costly, almost no one takes that option. I complained to flipkart they responded positively and Seagate also replaced the faulty disk with a new one. BUT I AM NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE SEAGATE, AS WHAT I LOST WERE MY SELF CREATED SOFTWARES, YES I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, AND TO LOSE YOUR OWN SOFTWARES IS PAINFUL
5|Flipkart as always very fast - product delivered within 2 days of ordering. The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Build quality - Compared to Seagate's earlier (Freagent Go) model (I have 320 GB and 500 GB) this does not feel so much sturdy. On day to day performance it does not have any significant impact. But when exposed to rough handling, how it performs is yet to be seen. However it is quite light weight and not bulky considering the storage size. Capacity - It gives 931 GB available storage space out of the box. There are some softwares (backup plus) that eats up part of the storage capacity. I think, by formatting the drive you can get more space if required, but some functionality will be lost. Speed - Highly satisfied with the speed using USB 3.0. With USB 2.0 max speed is about 25 mbps, while on 3.0 it goes above 100 mbps (That's awesome). Performance - Doesn't get heated up even after hours of usage. Fast performance and I have not noticed any data corruption or failure. Overall quite good. I would definoitely recommend this product , at this price.
1|I got this product and i was keeping all my data in the HD. The day i formatted my PC and tried to transfer my files from HD to PC, the HD stopped working.. Good thing is that Seagate was ready to give me a replacement without many questions but no data recovery!!
5|STYLISH BUILT IN QUALITY AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. FAST AND NOT HEATING AFTER HOURS OF USAGE. NO NOISE AT ALL. GO FOR IT IT WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY.
1|Flipkart is very good in fast delivery compared with snap deal , But received faulty external hard drive ( My BAD luck) . I suggest , it should be check before shipping to avoid inconvenience to end user. I don't have complaint from flip kart , as they have arrange for money back in 2 days.
5|Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB HDD is a best product of flipkart short usb cable but enough for laptop users best transfer speed and receiving speed amazing backup facility buy this product and enjoy.
1|This is the worst product i ever seen. Stopped working from after 21 days from the purchase date .Don't buy it. I have seen the problem i am facing is faced by others also . I found it when i am searching for a solution online
4|researching:- i was researching for a 1tb hard disk for a long time cause nowadays there are a lot of options then we used to have before 5-6 years. So i again came to know these usual brands like seagate, wd, transcend n sony!!!. it was shocking for me to see sony hard disk n like most of sony products stunning looks too. So i was totally confused as i didnt want to end up having a non working hard disk with all my data stuck in it. so, i asked my frnds about their hard disks n what brand should i choose. almost all of them recommended the brand they own. n the brands were like wd,transcend, toshiba, dell, seagate, sony. So, ultimately no help from there. One of my frnd bought a 1tb hdd for himself n it stopped working after 3-4 months but luckily he got the replacement from the service centre of that hdd company(dont wana disclose the companys name). So, i made up my mind not to buy that brand"s hdd. After alot of time i shortlisted seagate & wd, as they are very popular n leaders in hdd market(i apologize if i m wrong). So, seagate or wd. My frnds have wd n seagate both but not the latest models. Wd looked smaller than seagate in looks so i thaught wd would be a better option. But after 2-3 days i went to my frnds home n my frnd"s elder brother also owns the hard disk. When i asked him about it he said that it is around 6 years old n 250gb capacity n still working great!!!! it was a seagate hdd. I was impressed by its durability and long life as the owner of that hdd is a computer engineer n he use that hdd every single day. He said that seagate is a good brand to go for as u dont need to worry about going to the service centre cause it will always run smooth. Then i asked him about any prblms he had faced during this long 6 years n continuing? he replied to me that "hhhmmm i replaced the cable of the hdd twice n its cost me rs40 from nehru place. So then i decided to buy the seagate hdd.
5|By performance it will provide best service compared others Slim and sleek design 3.0 usb port 930 gb storage space latest technology with reliable price Really grt product from seagate.......
4|I feel that flipkart is having little bit high price compared to others. But product delivered in time and working fine.
5|The product is better than WD/Samsung/Buffalo in build/performance/service. If you want to buy, observe the price for few days. The price always changes with few days of interval. When I purchased, the price was bouncing between 5500 and 4100 frequently. I waited and observed for few days and purchased it at 4100.
1|I Brought it, transpefered my all data to it. and than.... It just stoped working. I regrate for my data loss.
3|this is a decent buy . but my kernel panics every time i plug in to my linux box . Works well with Mac and Windows though .
5|This Hard Disk is light weight, compact in size (you can keep it in shirt's pocket). This hard disk has a Matte finish to prevent scratches. Although the USB Cable is short, but you can easily use it on a desktop (i connected from the back of my CPU and kept it over the CPU) so it is certainly not that issue. Flipkart's Packing was perfect as always and the product had a seal from inside. But the Shipping time was not at par this time. (Ordered on Sunday and received on Friday) Why there is so much fluctuation in Price ? During GSOF the price was Rs. 4099 and the next day it went to up by Rs. 5650. I've only seen such fluctuations in gold, silver, crude oil etc. that too in Commodities market but why Flipkart ? Does this make any sense ? None the Less This is a great buy, if you are looking in portable 1TB section. It is light, sleek and fast.
1|Me and my friend have this HDD from last 11-12 month. This HDD require extra care. You can not use this HDD like any other HDD of seagate/WD etc. Seagate is a good brand but particularly this product is not worth for the money. So I suggest please go for any other seagate model.
5|About Flipkart - Very quick delivery. Excellent wrapping. Reasonable price. Great job done. Flipkart is excelling. About the product. I use it on USB3 of my Mac. Blackmagic speed test shows speed rating around 67MBps to 102MBps for various parameters. After using it for a couple of days, it seems to be giving average 67MBps real life speed. Not bad at all, though I was expecting a bit more. It is good that it can be used with thunderbolt adapter also. You can remove USB3 adapter at the top and then use thunderbolt to SATA adapter (that comes from seagate in the range of 8500/- Rs. Which is almost double the HDD cost. Hence not a viable option. Not sure whether they use SATA-II or SATA-III, it is probably SATA-II. Maybe Seagate can clarify. I got a write error once in first two days. Not sure if I have to return it for exchange shortly. Anyways, its a great product at reasonable price.
1|Broke in two month's time. In kolkata service is provided by accel and they are horrible. Doesn't treat customers well and waiting time for getting it repaired is approx. two months. Always buy western digital NEVER buy Seagate.
4|very good product but i'm not able to remove this hard disk drive safely after plugging in any pcs or laptop even when i close all background apps.it always keeps saying the drive is in use!any suggestions??
5|I purchased this external disk 2 month back. I really liked it. Awesome product. Disk read and write speed is very good. Please go for it.
5|What a DELIVERY !!!!! ordered this Tuesday , and got back on Wednesday (cannot believe it) Kudos to FLIPKART !!!!! I researched a lot for a great 1TB and 2TB external hard drive . Finally for a 1TB , the top two contenders were WD passport and Seagate Backup plus. Seagate has better speed than WD; Also,seagate has now increased the cable length which is longer than WD passport etc. So i finally bought it and i m very GLAD !! Features:- 1) great looks , and hard casing 2)good length of usb cable (about 43 to 45 cm) though i was amazed at people complaining about the length of cable. 3)read/write speed USB 3.0 = 110/100 MBps (ofcourse the speed would decrease if number of files are large) 4)User friendly Backup software 5)Total available space =931 MB 6)Does not get heated after many hours of operation ( i did for above 7 hours) 7)Very Silent P.S for a 2TB drive , i would suggest to go for WD Passport :))
4|For all those fellas who r confused between USB 3.0 hard disks. Let me know u something 1) All USB 3.0 hard disks provide same data transfer rate off around 60 Mbps on USB 3.0 port. (Tested HP, Seagate, and WD ). Primarily data transfer depends on type of file u r tranferring. Eg. Movies will transfer faster than some software. 2) All harddisks have same cable length. 3) Its that d brand name which causes price difference otherwise performance of all USB 3.0 hard disks are same(Atleast u will not notice any difference in daily usage). 4) The preloaded software in hard disks is for advertisement purpose as it merely copies files from ur pc/ laptop hardisk to ur external hard disk.
5|I Have A Seagate GoFlex External HDD. i buy in 2010 & going well .That Version is Changed in to BACKUP PLUS & i am Very Happy With That .

3|in product details nowhere RPM is defined, it has 5400 RPM speed, which is slower then the current market standards
5|I just got this product earlier today very cheap product from flipkart sellers now the price is raised I wonder why?. But the speed of this hdd is awesome got 80 mb/s speed then 50-60 mb/sec for up to 1 gb file but copying 100 gb it stopped at 21mb/sec still good but not to mention no heating at all seagate is best and flipkart is provides cheapest rates
5|the drive works perfectly it had great packing just after plugging in and opening installer the window asked if i wanted to use it btw windows n mac simultaneously or solely with mac really easy setup before expectation delivery good n safe packing it would have been great if flipkart would have given cases for this hd in combo rather than a pen drive pros: -easy to connect -speed upto 250-300mbps on usb 3.0 -sleek design -matt finish(looks good) -compatible between mac n windows interchangeably without reformatting -easy registration of disc online -999.39GB of space -cheap on price on flipkart got it for rs.4194 only cons doesn't comes with a pouch -short wire for a desktop -costly upgrades like to thunderbolt n fire wire800 -back up function cannot be used if its being used interchangeably between mac n windows -doest works on time machine if used interchangeably
5|I bought this from flipkart without using my own id a few days back i got this in 4 days. The Product is really awesome and is worth buying. It gives a 30-50 MBPS speed in 2.0 port. It is made up of hard plastic it fall down twice from my hand and till now there's no scratch. Just click the buy now button now.
5|Very Much Compact Design Slim & Smart Durable HDD Plus Points: 1. Sweet sleek design with mat finish.(5 out of 5) 2. Good speed, I got upto 25 MBps write speed in USB 2.0, and 100 MBps in USB 3.0. 3. Nice bundled backup software, that can take backup of your online content also. 4. Flexible design for connecting various adapters. If you want to use other connectivity like eSATA, Thunderbolt etc. just buy the adapter with the cable. MInus Points: 1. USB cable is very short.
5|Best part is that I bought it when the product was priced only Rs. 4599! :-) Really great product..... was delivered in less than 48 hours(from Delhi to Bhubaneswar)! Works really great - getting average of 23-25 Mbps writing speed for assorted files and nearly 30-32 Mbps for large files! And about 35-40 Mbps reading speed. (all the speeds are USB 2.0 speeds) The HDD doesn't heat up a lot even after prolonged usage! It's very good to look at and feels a little plastic at the bottom. I highly advice to get a hard case of the HDD!
5|Hello, I booked this product on 25 Aug 2013 and got it delivered on 29th. If you are looking to buy a 1TB hard drive, this is the best one. 1.Easy to use. 2.Very handy 3.Good data transfer rate of 30MBps in USB 2.0 4.Automatic Backup feature 5.It comes with a seagate dashboard software which helps in protecting data. 6.Free 1 year subscription to Seagate cloud storage. 7.Doesn't get heated up even after using for very long time.
4|Is the top portion of the product where the LED blinks is loose?... It seems not to be rigid but bends... except that the overall the product is excellent.. Pros good speed extremely portable fits my pocket.. fine touch
5|I have been using it since February. No problem so far. The colour looks beautiful and no scratch marks so far. The good thing is it does not get much hot nor does it make much noise. Only problem is USB cable is very short. I face problems while connecting it to a TV.
5|its a nice device...build quality is not so good though... sleek design and finish as well. you can pull of the top and use it as a internal as well. now that's most impressive..hehe there are a lots of color available 2 choose from and i got cyan 1... you can copy contents from the PC or copy into the ext hdd is smooth.speed 30Mbps (using in a 2.0 port) nd higher in 3.0 USB ports. i connect it directly with my 3d TV nd play mkv contents and it never lags. truly a must have product .... USB wire which is given with this product is 12 inch in length. its nt gold plated as well. but still works perfect till date! you can use it continuously 3 days or 2.....it doesn't heat up .... seagate is a reliable brand! take my word for it. hope its help you and thanx 4ur time....
3|I bought a Seagate Backup plus! Flipkart delivered it within 2 days. I have considered WD and Buffalo before finalizing on Seagate because of the 3-yr warranty and also because it gives high writing speeds. But, I never observed high speeds of writing myself. The max is saw was 22 Mbps. It might be because of my laptop that the speeds are low. (Studio 1558 - i3 processor - windows 7) So, think twice before ordering one!
5|when i got the product i opened it and then connect it to my laptop . my laptop has USB 2.0 . and 500 gb hard drive....i copy all my documents , pictures , songs , movies (approx 400 gb) in it ..... and after that backup my dvd collections it it ..... i use the hard drive 18 to 20 hours per day for 2 days ...... >> good speed in usb 2.0 >> very very silent hard drive >> no heating not even 1% >> no vibration .. no sound at all ....... >> BUILT QUALITY IS VERY NICE BEST POTABLE HARD DISK ....... GO FOR IT ....... /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5|If you are thinking of buying an ideal external hard disk for your laptop or your PC, its the appropriate one that you are looking for. Just you can blindly take this product as no other competitor can match the rigourity like this device.
5|This is simply the best portable hard disk I have brought, The looks are stunning, especially I like the Red as well as the blue one of my friends have. Performance is very very good. The only downside is the small cable but it can be lived with. Overall a stunning product !!! 5.0/5.0 And the usual and boring stuff, Flip-kart Rocks !!! :D
5|I bought this product almost 6 months ago...so i know almost everything about it...so I would like to keep it short and simple... ADVANTAGES: 1. Gives u an average speed of almost 50mbps wen copying large files like movies or photos or songs...almost 30mbps if ure backing up small files like documents or other user files... 2. small and compact...very easy to carry... 3. Comes with a software, Seagate Dashboard, which will back up your files on a daily basis without u even being knowing it...automatically...u just have to set ur settings... 4. Is very responsive...never got the problem of getting stuck or hanged... 5. The LED light is just a combination of beauty and efficiency...always useful... 6. 1 TB is just too big...will never want more space to store your things.. Disadvantages: 1. The USB cable could be a problem for those with a desktop with no front USB Ports...on the contrary, best for those with a laptop... My Advice: Just go for it!!!
3|i was just a little happy with the product.the data rate is very less than the featured.overall,it's an above average product.If you are thinking of better data rates prefer buffalo or western digital.
5|I ordered this hard disk around a month ago. Excellent Flipkart delivery. Now, this hard disk is the best I have used so far. My operating system is Windows 7. Speed of around 17 mbps while writing and around 25 mbps while reading when I am using USB 2.0. This was for medium and large sized files, say files more than 100 kb. Look's so classic. One of the largest free space providers. Hard Disks cheaper than this cut out the free space The cable is quite long, not too short like Transcend (for use with laptop). So, that's also an advantage. Encrypting this disk and partitioning it was also very easy. I have seen one WD hard disk having issues while encryption. So, this one is risk free. And what else, no humming sound is produced that would disturb you. Summarising it let's say, Pros 1) Very good matte finish, classic touch 2) More free space as compared to any other hard disk 3) Does not produce sound or becomes hot, no matter how long you use it. The longest I have used it in one go is 1 day 5 hours. 4) Supports USB 2.0 and 3.0 both, read/write speed from 17-28 mbps (avg) for large files (say more than 100 kb) 5) Price is the most economical in 1 TB range 6) Supports Windows 7, 8, XP as well as MAC OS Cons 1) The cable is a little short if you intend to use it for desktop. But, try to find the alternative to your desktop arrangement (like placing CPU on the desk rather than putting it down) instead of switching to a poor quality hard disk just for the sake of a long cable. 2) Buy a pouch for keeping your hard disk safe from scratches because on one side of the hard disk, there is a plastic cover and if you use it very roughly, it might get scratch. 3) Take precaution by not dropping your hard disk on the ground. Because, honestly I have not tried that, so cant say whether its unbreakable or not. Well, you could throw it on your bed if you like. There, it's safe. 4) The biggest disadvantage is you will fall in love with it and get addicted to it. That might not be a problem with most of you ;) -- So, go for this. And THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I have observed Flipkart keeps changing the price of this hard disk very frequently. While I am writing, the price dropped down by Rs 200/- . It's better if you grab it the moment it goes around Rs 4800/ - to Rs 4900/- . You could try it buying on Tuesday when there is 5% discount. I grabbed it for Rs 4571/- on Tuesday, the most cheapest price, I have seen in recent days.. So, guys and gals waiting out there to buy a hard disk. Stop your search right over here. because this is the one you are searching for..
5|>>>>>>>Am not bought this product in flip cart but i used this product since 2010.......... it is a nice,reliable and good among all other products...................now it is available in 4 colors...... it is very slim one toooo..............
5|Good one.. Just started using it.. let see. till now it is good performing. My Friends are using the same Model. They recommended it for me. I didn't find any performance issue with those hard disks. That's why I ordered it. Flipkart is exceptionally in the delivery of the electronics good.. I like the service provided by flipkart.
3|i earlier had a Seagate Freeagent goflex USB 2.0 which gave me a transfer rate of maximum 22 Mega bytes per second . In order to utilise the USB 3.0 ports in my lappy i decided to get the this hard disk . The transfer speed through my USB3.0 "high speed port" has been generally just 25 Mega bytes per second . I dont know if it is the problem of my HP pavilion Laptop or the hard disk , but I dont expect to get any thing close to 80 MBps which i had read in a previous review . Pros ==== 1. Light 2.Shiny 3. Better ergonomic design than my older Freeagent model Cons ==== Speed is lower than what is expected of a USB 3.0 port compatible hard disk thats all :)
2|I bought this hard disk before four month through flipkart.Right time its not working i go ahead for warrenty,they offers only replacement and not posible to get its backup. If i need i must have to pay RS 2000 for its backup.(but seagate was assured free backup also).
1|I purchased Backup Plus 1 TB portable from flipkart. It worked flawlessly for few months but one fine morning it stops functioning . It freezes my windows explorer every time it is plugged in. I tried using Seatools as suggested by segate support but even it freezes and fails to detect the drive. I may get a replacement drive as it is still under warranty period but I am afraid i have lost my precious data ! I guess i am not the only person to have such a bad experience. Advice : you should always save a copy of your data elsewhere. Use it strictly only as a Backup I suggest you to use it to store only movies or unimportant junk data which you can afford to loose
2|after 6 months of use, windows unable to detect. Ubuntu showing 99 sectors are bad. Tried formatting, no luck. was able to retrieve 40% of the data before formatting. Now looking for ways to get in touch with seagate support any idea ?
5|Its a very good external hard disk. Seagate always have made wonderful hard drive and this is one of them. I have USB 3.0 and it gives write speeds about 80Mbps. In USB 2.0 it gives over 20Mbps. The design is overall very good and attractive and doesn't get easily scratched but the hard disk is itself is very delicate. If you drop it then the disk might not work again and you might have to get a replacement which I had to do because I dropped it once and all my data got lost. But over all its a very good product and since the prices have been slashed to Rs 4500+ it is worth even more.
5|I ordered this product after looking the reviews on Flipkart. I am really surprised by the Flipkart delivery because i ordered this product in evening and next day morning it was delivered to me...Can't expect a better delivery than provided by Flipkart. Product was nicely packed and was as described. I ordered Seagate backup plus 1 TB in black color. The size of hard disk is very small and you can easily carry anywhere. It provides 931 GB available space. I am getting the writing speed of 40MB/s on my laptop. The length of cable provided is ok to use it with a laptop. There is no sound of the hard disk and also it does not heat up.
5|It's my first external HDD. I received it yesterday. The delivery took only 2 days. It was well-packed. First Impressions: A cute little item which resembles a scientific calculator in both size and weight. You get 1000(1.004*1.024*1.024) = 931 GB The disk contains about 1 GB of software: Video tutorials, Seagate dashboard, mac drivers and a registration portal. Copying Speed: USB 2.0: 27 MBps on a 2.4 GHz, i5 2nd gen, 8 GB RAM laptop. I haven't yet tried it with USB 3.0 Economical: Yes. A bigtime yes. It was a steal for Rs. 4,361. Buy Verdict: Go for it. It's cute, fast, highly portable, relatively inexpensive and comes with a 3 years warranty. Cons: I really wish it came with a case or pouch.
5|Sweet sleek design with mat finish. You get 930 GB. It comes with a single 3.0 USB Cable which can also be used in USB 2.0 Ports Awesome product and very small and easy to carry anywhere I purchased this HDD from flip cart on discount rate of Rs 4360 only as market rate was Rs 5100 so I Saved money also I wanted this for my X-Box 360 console as i have formatted the drive to FAT 32 format as by default it comes in NTFS format.. It never heated and never stops or hangs like the cheaper hard disks I will suggest only Seagate or Sony Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment.
5|The product comes with a USB 3.0 and Blue color is very good. Very simple to use. The Seagate dashboard software needs to be updated. Login and update. Once linked you can sync easily your folders. Make sure that you have good Norton or any anti-virus software installed I recommend this
5|Very good external HDD along with Seagate Dashboard software inside it and comes with USB 3.0 cable. For laptop owners cable's length is sufficient but desktop users may need to buy another one with more length. I have purchased it in blue color and as I thought, it has a nice look. After connecting to system, it shows 930 GB free space which is a big space in 1 TB segment to backup all stuffs. Tested on a USB 2.0 port by copying 200 GB data with speed of 25 - 28 MB/s. Runs cool and silently. Flipkart service is good as always. It is a good deal in this price range and value for money.
5|First of all I would like to inform u all that I bought this HDD from sapdeal because snapdeal was giving a free pouch as an offer.Now the offer is not available.Most of the people like to but product from flipkart so I thought to leave a feedback here also to make others informed about this particular product. Pros:-> 1.I copied nearly 200 GB of game files from my laptop to this HDD in USB 3.0 mode.It gave me 30-50 MBPS speed constantly.I just said wow that is the thing I am waiting for.Again I copied the same files to my laptop from my HDD. This time it gave me 60-90 MBPS speed.So u can see that the transfer speed is blazing fast. 2.Doesn't get heat up after hours of use. 3.The HDD working led is perfectly noticeable.Its white in colour and illuminates in its working time.The led looks awesome.No complain about it. 4.It ll not get any scratches I believe. 5.You can place it on ur palm. 6.Amazing looks. 7.The cable length is perfectly ok.I have seen many people are complaining about the cable length but there is nothing to complain.Believe me the cable size is perfectly ok.Even if u have desktop u can place the HDD on ur CPU roof if u want to place it in that place.For laptop users it is just just and just perfect.Stop complaining about the cable please. 8.If u r searching for an external HDD just go for it.It ll fulfill all ur tasks. Cons:-> 1. Some People are complaining about the short cable length which is totally a bullshit lie. 2.Not a single con. If u are a seagate HDD user U ll be always respecting ur decision for buying it.Own it and discover yourself :) :) :)
5|The product is amazingly light and well finished. The lamination around the product is a blessing (atleast till it lasts !!!). Transferred close to 150 GB and it was pretty fast. I ordered the product late evening and was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next morning by 10:00 AM. The packing was excellent and compliments to Flipkart for that. The delivery was also express. The only thing which irked me a little was a difference in the pricing of the same product based on the colour. Never heard of this anywhere. Apart from that keep up the good work and in Flipkart finally there is a dependable online store.
5|Nice, fast and have option to use for firewire or thunderbolt if you can get the adapter. Front portion with the cable is detachable and you can attach that part to any 2.5" data drive. This particular function is very useful if you are planning to change your laptop drive and want to transfer the data to another computer. Nice surprise is the software. If you buy this then you are eligible to download Paragon NTFS or HFS software for free from the seagate site. With HFS installed in Windows you can access mac files from the drive. Using the paragon NTFS on a mac use can read/write files on this from your mac. So either way you format this drive, you can use for both mac or Windows. That sets this drive from the rest. I bought it from local store and using it for Time Machine on my Mac mini. Working flawlessly.
5|Pros: 1) One of the best things about this hard disk is it's size. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans. :P 2) Contrary to the common belief, the usage indicator LED blinks perfectly. 3) Read speed of 35-40 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port. 4) Write speed of 15-25 MB/s on a USB 2.0 port (depending upon other programs running on your system). 5) Matte finish does give a pretty good grip. 6) Truly a light weight device. 7) Cable length is pretty much good enough for all laptop users. Cons: 1) None that I came across so far.
4|everything is good except the speed......giving speed of 19-25 mbps in 2.0 looks good,portable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nothing to do with backup plus software. got it in 30 hrs......so 5 stars to the flipkart service....keep going guys
5|Though not ordered by Flipkart because every time I order this drive it cancel another day, it is best external hard disk in flipkart. I order this drive by another portal. The design and build quality of this drive is awesome. you will get approx 100-110 Mbps at read and 70-80 Mbps at write in USB 3.0. So go for it..
5|I had problems with my internal HDD which was of Seagate, and it was promptly replaced by Seagate. After few months it again started giving problems. So I was a little unsure to invest in external HDD of the same company. I had to chose between Transcend, WD and Seagate. And I am very happy that I chose this one. Though its a bit pricy, its servicing, if there is any problem, which I dont hope there will be, is top notch. Data speed is not as fast as users claim, but it is because I am stuck with old age USB 2.0, though it did touch 40 mbps which was a novelty for me. Flipkart delivery as usual is the best, got the product in less than 24 hours. Recommended!!
5|very best product of seagate...with good easy options to handle your useful data. The Portable comes with a USB 3.0 connector which can be detached (exposing SATA data and power connectors) and swapped for a Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt connector, making it a tempting proposition for those concerned about future-proofing and backwards compatibility.
5|usb 2.0 max speed 30mb/s min speed 25mb/s usb 3.0 max speed 101mb/s min speed 80mb/s.......................... it s compact size to use everywhere, it can use multi operations internal hd and external hd, thanks to seagate :-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
4|I'm using the Drive for last one week and it is working very good. i'm able to play HD videos from the drive while I'm transferring data to it.. For file less than 1GB the transfer speed is more than 40 mb/s. But while transferring huge data like more than 10 GB, the speed reduces to 20 mb/s and it is maintained till the end. Haven't tried with USB 3.0 yet. Flipkart service is amazing as ever. got delivered on the 3rd day from the order.
5|I have purchased this product before 2 months from flipkart. The product was delivered timely but the packaging was not up to the mark. Coming to the product, Pros. : 1) HDD is well formed and nice in looks. 2) 25-35 MBPS stable speed in USB 2.0 and 60-90 MBPS stable speed in USB 3.0. 3) Good Seagate Dashboard software. 4) Vary silent. 5) Stays cool after hours of use. Cons. : 1) Drive LED in not much noticeable in working mode. 2) Finish is good but material quality is not up to the mark - feels not strong enough. I have researched a lot before purchasing this drive. This drive is better than others as others have some issues of not being reliable.
5|i bought this a couple of days back.as usual hats off to flipkart for superfast delivery.reg the drive its worth the buy.has a nice glossy finish.(mine was silver colour)relatively compact for its size ,fits in a normal formal trouser s pocket.transfer speeds are amazing.i was stunned with its speed. cloud option also available but for 1 yr only.the cable is very short, approx 1 ft and the cable wire is little thin.it does not get heated up even after long use(copied 120gb at a single time).seagate's promising quality. WORTH A BUY.......GO FOR IT
5|Its a great Hard Disk from Seagate. The most amazing thing of this hardrive is its dual mode option: use it as an external drive or just open the front flap and voila! you get sata and power port and hence, CAN BE USED AS AN INTERNAL DRIVE. No other drive has dual option. Pros: Amazing read/write speeds (115 MB/s in Internal Drive Mode SATA; 90 MB/s in USB 3.0; 30 MB/s in USB 2.0) Internal as well as External
5|I am not too tech savy and I simply required a backup device. The delivery by Flipkart was prompt and efficient as usual. I could plug in and use the device straight away without any problems. The cable length is relatively small but ideal for laptops and manageable for even PCs. Did not try any resource hungry applications so cannot comment about them but office applications and video files ran without any problems.
5|I had purchased Seagate STBU1000302 1 TB External Hard Disk(blue) 2 days ago... the delivery was so good as always...thank yu flipkart.... about the product..the best hard disk available in the market...those who wish to store movies than any other files would surely go for it because i felt more speed while copying movies than any other files... i got an average of 30mb/sec in USB2.0 as am using my HP netbook.... do not overheat when work for a long time...overall a good product...
4|Sleek and serves the purpose.The delivery was on time as usual from Flipkart. Works great on mac as well which was my primary concern when buying this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra storage space at a decent price.
5|I Have Been Using This Drive For 3 Months And I Have Put It Down For More Than Five Times But Nothing Has Happened To IT . The Led Indicator Gives It A Very Stylish Look . If You Are Using It IN Desktop Better Buy A Usb Extender Before Buying This And There Are No Other Cons . It Is The Best Product I Have Bought In Flipkart .
5|I ordered this product from flipkart. The service provided by them is just awesome. The product is definitely "Plug n play" type. I haven't tried its feature of collecting & managing data from social networking sites, but the overall quality of seagate HDD is awesome. I am not very sure about claiming product under waranty/how to avail it even after reading the manual. Hopefully i should not need that. Product is really light-weight & is only 14.5mm thick. ! Awesome. A must have. Two Thumbs Up !!
5|This hard-disk which I bought here after watching the reviews posted down here is truly unmatchable with any other External HDD products. I loved this one because of its Speed, Accuracy and Space Availability. You would not get better than this when you can connect with USB 2.0 or 3.0. Great going Seagate.
5|this hdd will give you 25-30 mbps transfer rate minimum in windows 7 with 4gb ram. and max transfer rate i get is 35mbps .all transfer rate i have tested in usb 2.0.and this is copying speed from your internal hdd to external hdd. i hope this will help you.
5|I received my product within 2 days of flipkart delivery date. . and if its about the product it is simply awesome. . its giving me transfer speed 38mb/sec {USB 2.0}.. . this product is great and of coursein an affordable price . . . Thank You FLIPKART.
4|A good product!!! Faced few problems with connection at first, but its fine now. I had paid 5k for the product 2 weeks back and it has increased like crazy.. Sad news is that i didn't get the pouch with that..It was compensated with some promotional amount..Thanks flipkart for that.. Can opt this product :)
5|Hi, I just got my Seagate external HDD back up plus 1 through Flipkart...Is awesome very light weight and pocket carrying.....Good one. Easily detected without having any issue.....I am very happy to have this one. It was a great deal and happy to receive a leather pack with this as an offer.
5|First of all, it is a Seagate product so quality is top-notch. I would recommend if you are buying an external HDD just check WD or Seagate, whichever you prefer in these two buy that. I personally researched and found out Seagate to be better. Pros for this drive: 1. Small and sleek 2. Good writing speed: around 21Mbps/sec with USB 2.0 port. I copied around 180 Gb of Data so calculated the average time 3. Good design and matte finish on the top 4. Got a cover along with the drive free which I think is a must have for dust protction and carrying it anywhere. 5. 930 Gb of space. 6. Price, at Rs4995 it is one of the cheapest drive. Plus you get some amazing Seagate softwares to backup data. Cons: 1. Small USB cable. Can use with a laptop, hard to use with a desktop specially if you have the USB Ports at Back 2. Not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it otherwise can get damaged and unable to use.
5|I bought this product on flipkart and it was delivered in 4 working days. Good service. Bought it for 5k. Good pricing(but you can get better deals online.) Now about the product. Seagate is one of the two leading storage service companies(other being WD) and it offers great after sales service. Pros: 1. Awesome looks, great styling. Has brushed aluminium texture to it. Looks premium end product. 2. Since its a USB 3.0 device I got a speed of 80Mbps write speed which is good in my opinion. 3. Very sleek and portable. Is even slimmer than some of the GoFlex drives. Cons: 1. The drive though looks awesome but is a little bit fragile in my opinion, so care of the hard drive is prime importance. Not that sturdy and may not be resistant to falls. 2. The cable is proprietary. (Not standard Mini-USB or Micro-USB) Conclusion: If you want a seagate 1TB hard drive this is the drive to buy, and I can recommend this to everyone.
5|I bought it from flipkart on 1november2012, it is a excellent hard drive from Seagate, which have 1. Attractive look 2. Good price 3. Higher speed than other 25mb/sec on USB2.0 4. It has USb3.0 5. Not required external power 6. Compaq and slim in size. I recommend to you. Thanks
5|First of all Thanks to flipkart for superb fast delivery. Seagate product have always been a reliable ones. Black version of Hard disk has a Matt smooth finish with temporary lamination. You can peel it of if u wish, but better to retain it. Hard disk offers 993GB freespace with preloaded Seagate softwares. Con: Nothing really if you can leave out cable length issue. Product: 9/10 (1 for Length of the cable-too short)
5|Every rupee spent in taking this hard drive is worth.The speed are amazing even in USB 2.0 and it comes with a backup support with just 100 bucks more than the expansion drive .I still don't know how the back up is really useful and the looks and size of the hard drive just makes u fall in love with and it and it is amazing to hold it.would have define lily liked the seagate symbol with a light to make it more seagate.In the case of computer pherpharls i would like flipkart to take its pricing changes seriously like which theyI do for mobile.I purchased this in s.p.road for 4800 all inclusive and got a seagate pouch for the hard drive which flipkart was not giving at the time I brought.
5|got it today from flipkart.. its simply awesome! , looks and works equally great! you can use its additional features like seagate back up , save protect... or you can use it as a usual hard disk... there's absolutely no reason not to pick this one for 1 TB hard disk... its the best amongst this range! GO for it!
5|i was having need for a high speed, portable 1TB storage. After long searching on flip-kart.com i found that this product is fulfilling all my requirements.it was my bad luck ( lots of holidays) this time so i received the product after about 18 days from order date. Pros- 1. Affordable. 2. Quality mark of seagate 3. Trust mark of Flipkart.com 4. amazing look & very portable size. 5. Light weight. (u may feel that packing box is empty). 6. Comes with USB 3.0 (Superspeed) cable with USB 2.0 backward compatibility. Cons- 1. Its Price is going down continuously :. (but i couldn't wait anymore). 2. Gives only 931 GB usable space. 3. Cable length is very short.
5|Awesome product from Seagate. 1. Smaller and lighter than any 1TB Hard disc in the range and om its predecessors. 2. Very beautiful and subtle color. 3. Has got a metallic luster and good finish. 4. Write Speed is about 30 Mbps in USB 2.0 though it is USB 3.0 5. Negligible vibration if compared with other hard discs.
5|awesum product...doesnt get heated up even wen used fr more than 6 hrs.. usb 3.0 supports write speed of 90mbps.. 2.0 supports 25mbps... smalll & stylish.. worth the prize.
5|Got it today and seeing the fragile packing felt so good. Flipkart self-delivery is safe. Connected it to my Laptop(Window 7 Dual Core) and within a minute the driver got installed and disk was up and running. So don't think of laptop configuration as a hindrance for buying the advanced hard-disk. Registration takes another minute. With the USB adapter for 2.0 I am getting the speed of 20Mbps. It comes with an option of upgrading the speed by buying other adapters. Transferred 200GB in a go, even then the disk wasn't hot which is so cool. One of the best selections. This is my second Hard-disk, I also have I-Omega 320 GB which is good but this Seagate is way better.
5|If you are looking for a 1TB Hard disk this is the one. Excellent and cool blue texture along with a very high transfer speed this is a must buy at this range. The USB cable is also better than the Go-flex one. Besides the Backup feature helps you to backup your files online. Overall its ten upon ten. Cons : Still looking for one. And thanks to flipkart for such a smart packaging and quick delivery.
1|I ordered this Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB Ext. HDD, but the seller shipped Seagate Backup Plus Slim which was chepper than this one I ordered. But I decided to keep the product cause I liked it design & looks, but when I started to transfer files, it stopped in between . Then i tried with different files , it stopped again. then i realised that this product is defective and I requested for refund . So , I recommend you all to first check that have u got the same item that u ordered
1|Your Service is very bad... You guys don't know to read english??? I have ordered for a Backup Plus 1 TB Harddisk and you have delivered Backup plus Slim 1 TB Hard disk... Again I am having the headache for returning it!!! Very bad service!!!
1|Seagate Care is not giving replacement due to fainted back (some of S/N is fainted), they are not replacing after showing Flipkart Invoice letter too.........
4|awsum dlivery by flipkart..havent used this product yet.just one quest is d uppr part of d drive detachable..i mean it seems a bit loose and i am new to xternal har drive so just wana knw..thanks in advance :):)
5|The Next generation of external hard disks from seagate featuring the Universal Storage Module connector port which allows for higher transfer speeds with USB 3.0, firewire or thunderbolt connectors. Good looks, High Transfer speed and very portable. Highly Recommended.
1|I have bought this product through flipkart and been using for 5 months.... Recently I faced a issue that hard drive stopped being detected. this same problem has been reported by many seagate users recently. there have been many defective cases of seagate hard drive and i am a proof for that. I lost 800 GB valuable data along with most of my work related data. The seagate customer care failed in retrieving the data. Even if they could they cost too much that you decide its better not to. So my advice is to avoid buying them and if you seriously consider buying, then buy two!!
5|one of the best storage device that i found. but dont buy it in flipkart. the cost of the product is high upto rs.500+.. so avoid buying in flipkart. better go to any computer shop and get. if you are in chennai, try omega in richi street. best.
5|Hello friends, this is a short review of the above-mentioned three hard disk WD my passport, WD elements, Seagate backup plus: all are 1 TB hard disk and all are purchased from Flipkart. Using Seagate backup plus for last one year and WD elements for last six months and just purchased the WD my passport. All are decent hard disk having few cons. I had purchased all the hard disks during ongoing discount offers is and purchased the backup plus(red) @ Rs 4395/-, WD elements @Rs3590, and WD my passport(red)@ Rs4550. Which is very much cheaper than the retail shop. Coming to Seagate backup plus, it's a very good hard disk practically no vibration or heating issue and without any other significant issue. The connecting cable is short, but you should know that if the cord is too much long, then the data transfer speeds will also decrease. Look wise it is very good but still it is inferior to WD my passport or elements. The bundled softwares are very good for online backup. This hard disk has lowest reported failure rates. Its data transfer rate is blazing fast,more than 25mbps while transferring video files and a little bit lower in case of software and other types of file. But after continuous transfer of 100 GB, there is no or very little heating issue and no vibration issue. You may find very fine sound in the hard disk if you keep it closer to the ears during data transfer. Using WD elements 1 TB for last six months. It's a very good looking sleek lightweight hard disk. The today there is no issue. It's greater transfer rate is very much similar to that of Seagate backup plus. There is a little vibration during data transfer. I have one advice for those who are using WD hard disk is that, after getting your hard disk first install the software(smartware) in your desktop and configure the hard disk setting: set the idle time to the lowest available, that is, 10 min. What does it mean? After continuous non-using your hard disk for 10 min will put the hard disk to idle state. It will both decrease your power consumption as well as increase your hard disk longevity. One more thing, you should format your hard disk to NTFS and at lowest possible allocation units for example, 64KB. You should also routinely perform disk defragment and disk check up which will increase your device stability and performance. Coming to WD my passport, using it for last few days. It's nice look, lightweight and sleek design impressed me. Data transfer rates very similar to that of WD elements or more than that but lower than backup plus. There is little bit vibration issue but everyone should accept it because the disk of WD hard disk is placed very close to the casing box that's why the vibration is felt. Heating issue is very minimum compared to WD elements but more than Seagate backup plus. You should not transfer more than hundred GB data at a time in WD hard disks. You should also perform the maintenance task is mentioned in the WD elements segment. It is estimated that more than 6% hard disk fails within three years of purchase. Now, the final verdict, if you are trying to backup your personal photos videos or other important documents, you should always use more than one hard disk or you may backup those data in the cloud storage, e.g. dropbox or google drive. Otherwise if disk failure occurs, it will just make your life hell to recover the data and also recovery cost is too much. Seagate and WD are the best available hard disk in the world, so choose as per your requirement. But my suggestion is that if it is your first hard disk then go to Seagate backup plus: y
